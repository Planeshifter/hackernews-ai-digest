### Self-Supervised Learning for Videos

#### [Submission URL](https://www.lightly.ai/post/self-supervised-learning-for-videos) | 85 points | by [sauravmaheshkar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sauravmaheshkar) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41310834)

In the evolving landscape of machine learning, self-supervised learning is proving to be a transformative approach, especially for image processing. However, its application to video content remains largely underexplored due to the complexity and multi-dimensional nature of video data. An intriguing article dives into how concepts like Masked Autoencoders, which have shown remarkable promise in image classification, can be adapted for video through the VideoMAE architecture.

The original Masked Autoencoder (ImageMAE) model, developed by He et al., revolutionized image learning by treating images as a collection of non-overlapping patches that are partially obscured, requiring a lightweight decoder to reconstruct the original image from visible patches. This method expertly leverages the inherent redundancy in images, enabling efficient training with high masking rates while using minimal computational resources.

However, applying this strategy directly to videos poses unique challenges. Videos contain both temporal and spatial dimensions, leading to "temporal redundancy" where consecutive frames often depict similar scenes. This redundancy risks the model memorizing the content instead of genuinely learning representations, as it can easily extract highly correlated information from neighboring frames.

To tackle these challenges, the VideoMAE model introduces several innovative strategies: it incorporates temporal downsampling for efficient frame selection, utilizes a joint space-time cube embedding to reduce input dimensions, and applies high masking ratios to minimize information leakage. These adaptations significantly enhance the model's pre-training performance while reducing computational costs. Notably, pre-trained models using VideoMAE have shown superior results compared to those trained from scratch or with alternative methods.

By weaving together these advanced self-supervised learning techniques, VideoMAE stands at the forefront of making video representation learning more efficient and robust, proving that while the challenges are enormous, the solutions are equally groundbreaking.

The discussion around the submission on self-supervised learning in video content introduces several points from various participants:

1. **Albert_e** emphasizes the idea that capturing 3D aspects in learning representations can greatly improve understanding, particularly when depth perception is involved. He mentions how human visual systems project 3D scenes onto 2D planes, suggesting that this perspective could be beneficial for interpreting video data.
   
2. **Joelio182** simply responds with "cl," which could signify agreement or acknowledgment.

3. **Byyoung3** expresses appreciation for the work by stating "Nice wrk."

4. **Ptmlslvr** notes that self-supervised learning controls video frames by utilizing sequential representations, highlighting the sophistication of the approach. A reference to another research paper, titled "JPEG-LM: LLMs Image Generators as Canonical Codec Representations" is also included.

5. **Ljlll** concludes with a brief commendation, saying "Cool."

Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of appreciation for the advancements in video representation learning and intrigue about the methodologies discussed, with participants sharing their thoughts on the potential impact and innovative nature of the VideoMAE model.

### Show HN: Handwriter.ttf – Handwriting Synthesis with Harfbuzz WASM

In an innovative blend of typography and technology, a new project on GitHub named **Handwriter.ttf** allows users to synthesize handwriting using WebAssembly (WASM) technology integrated with Harfbuzz. The project leverages a lightweight recurrent neural network (RNN) model to create handwritten-style fonts on-the-fly, culminating in a unique way to render text.

This proof-of-concept requires users to run a Docker image, enabling them to type in a modified version of the Gedit application. To trigger the handwriting effect, users prefix their sentences with a `#`, transforming simple text input into stylized handwriting based on predictive stroke generation. While the resulting handwriting might occasionally have quirks—due to model limitations—subtle adjustments can improve the aesthetics.

The handwriting synthesis process stems from Alex Graves's research on RNNs, employing techniques to predict pen positions and rasterize strokes accurately. The project boasts impressive performance, generating text at a rapid rate, and offers detailed optimization strategies for those looking to delve deeper into the technical side.

For enthusiasts interested in merging art with technology, this repository is a fascinating foray into the future of digital typography.

### Google's AI search gives sites dire choice: share data or die

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/business/technology/2024/08/15/googles-search-dominance-leaves-sites-little-choice-on-ai-scraping/) | 23 points | by [gslin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gslin) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41315203)

In a recent exploration of the evolving landscape of online search, Google’s deployment of AI-generated summaries has put publishers in a precarious position. As users increasingly find AI Overviews at the top of search results, many site owners fear that the relevance of their content may diminish, potentially leading to reduced traffic and visibility. The dilemma is stark: publishers must choose between allowing their content to be used by Google's AI tools or risk disappearing from search results entirely.

Industry experts highlight that Google's dominance in the search engine sphere creates a challenging environment for publishers, who are caught in an "existential crisis." While AI advancements promise to enhance user experience, they also threaten the very foundation of content-driven websites that rely on traffic from search results. Companies like Google have been reticent to negotiate with media outlets, exacerbating the issue as new AI startups seek to license content to compete.

As these dynamics unfold, many publishers feel trapped between surrendering their content for Google's AI endeavors or potentially facing a decline in their online presence. The situation presents a stark reminder of the complexities faced by digital content creators as the search landscape continues to evolve.

In the discussion on Hacker News, users are expressing concerns about Google's impact on small web publishers and SEO practices. One user, "smln," mentions blocking Googlebot, suggesting a strategy to mitigate Google's effects on their site ranking. Another user, "mtdt," laments the decline of small web businesses due to Google's dominance, stating that personal sites are now virtually ineffective due to malicious SEO tactics. "nrbn" adds that alternative search engines could provide relief, indicating that there is a growing need for viable competitors to Google.

Users also discuss the manipulation of search results by Google, with "Rinzler89" asserting that Google's near-monopoly in search harms itself by not supporting smaller sites. There’s a consensus that the overwhelming control Google has on the search engine market (over 90%) creates significant challenges for publishers and encourages a discussion about possible alternatives in the search landscape.
