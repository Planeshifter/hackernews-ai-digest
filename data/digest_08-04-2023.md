### Non-determinism in GPT-4 is caused by Sparse MoE

#### [Submission URL](https://152334H.github.io/blog/non-determinism-in-gpt-4/) | 370 points | by [152334H](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=152334H) | [164 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37006224)

The latest version of OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, has been causing some confusion due to its non-deterministic behavior. Even when set to a temperature of 0.0, which should result in deterministic output, GPT-4 still produces different results. This has raised questions about why this behavior persists, especially since it was reported over three years ago.

A recent paper on Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models may provide some insights. In the paper, it was mentioned that MoE models, like GPT-4, can become non-deterministic at the sequence level when tokens from different sequences compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. This suggests that the non-determinism in GPT-4 could be attributed to its Sparse MoE architecture.

To test this hypothesis, the author decided to ask GPT-4 itself by writing a script that generates multiple completions using different models. The results of the experiment confirmed that GPT-4's non-determinism is consistent across models, providing further evidence for the impact of its Sparse MoE architecture.

While the exact cause of the non-determinism is still not fully understood, this research offers valuable insights into the behavior of GPT-4 and highlights the challenges in achieving full determinism in complex language models.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the non-deterministic behavior of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model and the reasons behind it. Some commenters point out that non-determinism is expected in certain scenarios, such as with GPUs or when using certain programming primitives. Others suggest that the behavior may be related to the design of GPT-4's Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

There is debate about the impact of non-deterministic behavior on performance and reliability. Some argue that determinism is crucial for reproducibility and safety, while others suggest that the benefits of non-determinism, such as improved performance, outweigh the drawbacks.

The discussion also touches on the challenges of achieving determinism in complex language models and the trade-offs involved. It is noted that achieving determinism often comes at the cost of increased development time and potential performance overhead.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and trade-offs involved in ensuring determinism in language models like GPT-4, as well as the varying perspectives on the importance of determinism in different contexts.

### LK-99 is an online sensation but replication efforts fall short

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02481-0) | 325 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [367 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37001837)

In a recent preprint, a team of Korean researchers claimed to have discovered a superconductor that works at room temperature and ambient pressure. However, initial attempts to reproduce the result have been unsuccessful, and scientists remain skeptical. Two separate experimental efforts by teams in India and China did not observe signs of superconductivity in the material. A third experiment found near zero resistance in the material at -163 °C, but this is still far from room temperature. Theoretical studies using computational methods have also not found evidence of superconductivity in the material. While the claim of a room-temperature superconductor has generated excitement, scientists caution that there is no guarantee such a material would be of practical use.

The discussion surrounding the submission is divided. Some commenters express disappointment and skepticism towards the claims of the room-temperature superconductor. They criticize the lack of replication in the experiments and question the credibility of the researchers. Others point out that there is evidence supporting the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in other materials, such as graphene. They highlight the importance of replication and caution against getting too excited without further validation. There are also discussions about the role of scientific journals, the importance of evidence, and the tendency for people to latch onto sensational claims without sufficient scrutiny. Some commenters bring up unrelated topics, such as climate change and geopolitical tensions. Overall, there is a mix of skepticism, curiosity, and debate about the potential implications of the claimed discovery.

SymbolicAI: A Neuro-Symbolic Perspective on Large Language Models

SymbolicAI is a framework that combines machine learning, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), with classical and differentiable programming. It breaks down complex problems into smaller, more manageable tasks, and then reassembles them to solve the original problem. This approach allows developers to seamlessly transition between differentiable and classical programming paradigms, harnessing the power of both. The framework offers tutorials, documentation, and examples to help users get started. It also provides various tools, such as a chatbot and package manager, to facilitate application development. SymbolicAI aims to bridge the gap between traditional symbolic reasoning and modern deep learning techniques.
