#### [Submission URL](https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/) | 184 points | by [Wilsoniumite](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Wilsoniumite) | [150 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43323755)

In a humorous and insightful exploration, a Hacker News user recounts their experiment with Language Learning Models (LLMs) to rank 97 fellow users based on their potential as software engineers at Google. Despite a random naming system in place, the LLMs showed a peculiar bias, often favoring "Person One" or "Person Two" even though names were allocated randomly. The writer's frustration grew as attempts to rectify this bias through various methods, such as modifying prompts, proved ineffective.

Curiously, when humans were brought in for a related experiment to rank Text-to-Speech (TTS) voices, they exhibited their own biases – notably a preference for the right-side sample, a phenomenon previously documented in psychological studies. This revelation was both vexing and vindicating, illustrating that humans are just as prone to biases as AIs are.

The crux of the story is a reminder of the persistent nature of bias, whether in AIs or humans, and the importance of large sample sizes and randomization to mitigate its effects. It humorously suggests that the measures we use to navigate human biases can be beneficial in managing AI inconsistencies too. If you feel like putting it to the test, the user welcomes you to provide your unbiased rankings of TTS voices. Check out their ongoing study and contribute at [link](https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/).

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the limitations and biases of AI, particularly LLMs, and their implications compared to human flaws. Key points include:  

1. **AI’s Reliability Issues**: Users tested LLMs (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) on simple tasks like stating the current date, revealing frequent inaccuracies. Many models defaulted to outdated or fabricated dates, highlighting their reliance on static training data and inability to access real-time information.  

2. **Bias and Overconfidence**: LLMs often produce confidently wrong answers (e.g., nonsensical explanations about "how chickens lay eggs"), mirroring human tendencies toward overconfidence despite flawed reasoning. This parallels the original submission’s observation that both humans and AI exhibit stubborn biases.  

3. **AGI and Intelligence Debates**: Skepticism emerged about LLMs being steps toward AGI. Critics argued they lack true understanding, introspection, or contextual awareness, with one user quipping, "LLMs are closer to Alzheimers patients" due to their confident yet disconnected responses.  

4. **Human vs. AI Capabilities**: Discussions compared AI’s limitations to human shortcomings. Some noted that even successful humans might not fit narrow definitions of "intelligence," while others debated creativity—whether "novel solutions" require prior knowledge or arise from deduction/observation.  

5. **Practical Concerns**: Users expressed worries about AI replacing human roles, particularly outside STEM, where its unreliability could lead to chaotic outcomes. Others suggested technical fixes (e.g., injecting real-time metadata), though these were seen as partial solutions.  

6. **Philosophical Tangents**: References to Kant’s philosophy and critiques of how intelligence is measured underscored the complexity of defining "intelligence" for both humans and machines.  

The thread concluded with a mix of frustration and fascination, acknowledging AI’s potential while emphasizing its current flaws and the need for rigorous testing, transparency, and humility in deployment.

### Generative AI Hype Peaking

#### [Submission URL](https://bjornwestergard.com/generative-ai-hype-peaking/) | 94 points | by [bwestergard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bwestergard) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43322570)

As we near what could be the peak of generative AI hype in 2025, some industry watchers are urging a new perspective on the technology's real-world impact. Despite bold claims about AI revolutionizing labor productivity, the anticipated effects are proving more complex and nuanced. 

Generative AI has indeed achieved notable process innovations, particularly in software development and customer support. From streamlining code queries with tools like ChatGPT to enabling chatbots to manage basic customer service tasks, AI has optimized certain workflows. However, these advancements haven't entirely revolutionized industries or eliminated human roles as some predicted. Instead, they've subtly altered how tasks are handled, sometimes leading to a less satisfying customer experience for those without the means to bypass automated systems. 

In the tech job market, AI's influence is creating a dilemma. LLMs are augmenting—or even replacing—less experienced developers, while seasoned professionals see only slight job market shifts. This trend could impact the future workforce, limiting opportunities for new developers and altering educational approaches in computer science.

Investor excitement around AI may be cooling, as evidenced by declining stock prices like NVIDIA's, which are down roughly 20% this year. Many foresee we're entering a "trough of disillusionment," indicating a shift in tech investment narratives. Still, voices like Brynjolfsson suggest AI-driven productivity could eventually boost demand for software development roles.

Adding to the conversation is the revival of Jevons' Paradox, where rising efficiency doesn't always translate to reduced consumption. AI's potential for increased usage alongside efficiencies suggests a complex consumption pattern moving forward.

Lastly, AI's more disruptive 'killer app' might not revolutionize productivity but rather the realm of digital interactions—think bots driving political influence on social media, or automating the initial phases of scams, reminiscent of the "Dead Internet Theory." While extreme, it underscores the less visible but significant impacts of AI technology. 

As we grapple with these realities, the industry must reevaluate how AI technologies are integrated and regulated to ensure reasonable expectations and sustainable growth.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

In a fascinating fusion of simplicity and depth, "antirez" unveils a C-coded reinforcement learning (RL) masterpiece, showcasing a neural network learning the humble game of tic-tac-toe—without reliance on external libraries or frameworks. This elegant piece of code, a mere semblance of the often vast RL libraries, fits snugly within 400 lines and intentionally embraces clarity for the curious developer.

Here's the scoop: constructed from scratch, this neural network learns from scratch too. With zero knowledge about tic-tac-toe intricacies, save for avoiding moves in occupied spots and recognizing wins, ties, or losses, the program embarks on a tabula rasa journey. It's truly a neural novice, initializing with random weights and playing against a shambling, random-move adversary until it learns to excel through sheer practice—achieving an impressive win rate after millions of games.

The repo is neatly organized: the game states are driven by simple structs, while a hard-coded neural network processes inputs and generates outputs, modeling the sparse 5,478 states of tic-tac-toe. With no more than 2809 parameters, this minimalist network demonstrates how straightforward mechanics like RELU activations and softmax outputs can still lead to near-perfect play. 

For those looking to roll this program on their own hardware, the package is openly licensed under BSD-2-Clause, providing a delightful experience—code, compile, and go head-to-head against an RL-enhanced opponent. Run it for enough matches, and it may become the unbeaten tic-tac-toe tactician.

This project packs a punch for aspiring programmers and AI enthusiasts to understand the essence of reinforcement learning and neural networks, while also celebrating the ingenuity of learning models, minus the overwhelming complexity—an homage to simplistic brilliance worthy of a Turing Award nod to Sutton and Barto. Whether for education or sheer curiosity, diving into antirez's ttt-rl promises a rewarding escalation from novice to savvy strategist.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion begins with user **trc** questioning how the neural network in the tic-tac-toe program understands scoring and game mechanics, expressing confusion about its learning process. **antirez**, the creator, clarifies that the program uses reinforcement learning (RL) to grasp game rules *intrinsically* (e.g., blocking opponent moves, seeking wins) and emphasizes that the neural network starts with **random weights**, improving through trial and error against random opponents.  

**trc** acknowledges the explanation, stating the clarified logic now "makes sense" after reviewing the code and thanking **antirez** for sharing. **antirez** reciprocates with a brief gratitude note.
