### Authors seek Meta's torrent client logs and seeding data in AI piracy probe

#### [Submission URL](https://torrentfreak.com/authors-seek-metas-torrent-client-logs-and-seeding-data-in-ai-piracy-probe-250120/) | 148 points | by [miki123211](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=miki123211) | [155 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772771)

In a growing legal battle over AI and copyright infringement, a group of authors, including notable names like Richard Kadrey and Sarah Silverman, is pushing for deeper scrutiny into Meta's practices related to pirated content. The authors accuse Meta of using their works, particularly books, without permission, asserting that the company tapped into the controversial LibGen shadow library via BitTorrent to source training data for its AI models.

While Meta has admitted to using "unofficial" sources for training, it maintains that its actions fall under fair use protections. However, the introduction of evidence concerning Meta's torrenting activities has opened new legal avenues. U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria recently allowed the authors to amend their complaint, specifically addressing these claims of "seeding" pirated content and acting as a distributor of copyrighted works.

With the court's blessing, the authors are now seeking Meta's BitTorrent logs to determine how much pirated content was downloaded and shared. They contend this data is crucial to proving willful infringement, a claim that could weaken Metaâ€™s fair use defense. This case emphasizes the significant tensions between AI development and copyright laws, setting the stage for potential landmark decisions on the use of protected works in technology training.

In the discussion surrounding the legal battle between authors and Meta regarding copyright infringement and AI training data, several key points were raised:

1. **Alternative Text Data Sources**: Users emphasized that there are viable alternatives to using pirated content for training AI models. Many suggested that companies could invest in purchasing large quantities of licensed text data rather than resorting to piracy.

2. **Copyright Compliance vs. AI Training**: A contention arose regarding whether existing copyright laws, often established in the 19th century, are suitable for addressing modern scenarios involving AI. Some commenters argued that AI development should follow more contemporary regulations while others felt that the risks to intellectual property still necessitate strict adherence to current copyright laws.

3. **Implications of Evidence Against Meta**: The implications of Meta's alleged use of pirated content and its impact on their fair use defense became a significant focus. Users were curious about how the court proceedings might evolve and impact broader industry practices.

4. **The Ethics of AI Training**: The ethical implications of utilizing copyrighted material for AI training stirred debate, with some participants suggesting that it might infringe upon human dignity and rights. Others expressed skepticism toward the social responsibilities of tech companies.

5. **Cost and Feasibility of Legal Practices**: A concern was raised about the financial feasibility of acquiring books for training datasets, with some arguing that $50 million for a million books might be a cost-effective investment compared to the alternatives.

6. **Technological and Societal Balance**: Users echoed a desire for a balance between technological advancements and ethical responsibilities, lamenting situations where profit motives overshadow societal impacts.

Overall, the discussion highlighted a deep concern regarding copyright issues in AI development, with differing viewpoints on ethics, legality, and practical implementations shaping the conversation.

### After Authenticity (2018)

#### [Submission URL](https://subpixel.space/entries/after-authenticity/) | 36 points | by [antoviaque](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=antoviaque) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772300)

In a thought-provoking entry for Subpixel Space, Toby Shorin explores the concept of "post-authenticity," tracing the evolution of our cultural fixation on authenticity, particularly among artists and creators. In the past, selling outâ€”like Shepard Fairey transitioning his street art into a commercial skate brandâ€”was viewed as a betrayal. Yet, over the past decade, this notion has largely dissipated. 

Shorin argues that authenticity has transformed from an ideal to a relic of an earlier cultural moment, suggesting that contemporary creators, inspired by high-profile figures like Kanye West, now embrace personal branding as an accepted norm rather than an ethical lapse. He details how the very concept of authenticity has roots in a disdain for commodification, revealing a tension within cultural production that has shifted significantly since the 2000s. 

The rise of the "hipsters" and their cultural language emphasized a quest for originality, often rejecting commercialized experiences as inauthentic. However, Shorin posits that this paradigm has evolvedâ€”merchandising, even for well-known artists, is now celebrated rather than vilified, signaling a substantial change in cultural values over the last twenty years.

Amid this cultural shift, Shorin invites readers to reconsider what authenticity truly means in an age where personal branding is heralded as an achievement, effectively marking a departure from the once prevalent skepticism of commodification and the search for the "genuine" in creative expression.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around Toby Shorinâ€™s exploration of "post-authenticity" and the cultural shifts regarding authenticity in the creative industry. Users present various perspectives and criticisms about the implications of commodification and authenticity in modern culture.

1. One commenter laments the idea that multi-million dollar corporations' missions have become corrupted, emphasizing how individuals now compromise their values for financial gainâ€”illustrating a troubling normalization of a previously frowned-upon culture of commercialism.

2. Another finds value in a YouTube channel that delves into the philosophical aspects surrounding the evolving definition of authenticity and technology's role in it. This suggests that even established narratives around authenticity can be re-examined in light of new cultural frameworks.

3. Several users engage with the concept of hipster culture and its eventual commercialization, discussing how once revered artistic values have shifted toward a norm that celebrates branding and merchandising, even for prominent artists. This change is noted as a departure from previous efforts to maintain originality and authenticity in artistic expression.

4. A critical perspective is shared on the challenges of maintaining authenticity in contemporary youth culture, which some believe has fallen victim to commodification and market-driven interests. Commenters reflect on the influence of social media and popular culture on shaping perceptions of authenticity.

Overall, the discussion showcases a landscape rich with diverse viewpoints on the transformation of authenticity in creative practices, highlighting both nostalgia for past ideals and a recognition of new cultural realities.
