### iRobot Founder: Don't Believe the AI and Robotics Hype

#### [Submission URL](https://crazystupidtech.com/2025/09/29/irobot-founder-dont-believe-the-ai-robotics-hype/) | 236 points | by [herbertl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=herbertl) | [157 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45418261)

The gist: In a new interview with Om Malik, robotics pioneer Rodney Brooks urges a reality check on AI and robotics. Flashy demos aren’t the same as systems that work in messy real-world environments, and the AI “revolution” will take longer than people think. He’s optimistic about humans + robots—just not the humanoid hype cycle.

Highlights:
- “Flashy demo” vs. reality: Brooks says demos avoid the unpredictable chaos of real deployments, which is why progress takes time.
- Humans will be fine: He rejects AGI doomerism and the notion that robots will replace people wholesale.
- Beware “machine idiots”: Over-reliance on automation (GPS, robo-taxis) can leave humans unable to intervene when things go wrong. Example: Waymo still needs human support; users can’t always help when it fails.
- Build simple, reliable systems: Brooks’ new company (Robust.AI) is shipping Carta—smart carts for fulfillment warehouses that:
  - Navigate, localize, and guide workers to items
  - Cut brutal walking loads (workers often do ~30,000 steps/day)
  - Let humans stay in control via a “magic handlebar” that amplifies small movements
  - Are safety-aware (avoid ladders/people; reroute on blocked aisles and report issues)
- Philosophy: Keep the person in the loop. Tech should reduce cognitive and physical load, not chase sci-fi demos. Today’s achievable “simple intelligence” can be transformative at scale.

Why it matters:
- Counters the current humanoid-robot narrative with a practitioner’s view: reliability, safety, and human factors beat showpieces.
- Points to a big near-term opportunity: augmenting human workers in warehouses with pragmatic autonomy, not replacing them.
- Timely reminder that AI progress is uneven—deployment friction, edge cases, and human behavior are the hard part.

The discussion around Rodney Brooks' skepticism of humanoid robot hype and AI overpromises reveals several key themes:

1. **Skepticism of Demos vs. Reality**:  
   - Users compare flashy robotics/AI demos to products like Roomba, noting that practical, limited tools often outperform ambitious but unreliable systems.  
   - Analogies to Microsoft’s Clippy highlight concerns that even advanced LLMs (like ChatGPT) might offer superficial utility without deeper understanding or reliability.

2. **LLM Limitations and Use Cases**:  
   - Debate arises over whether LLMs can perform calculations (e.g., insurance simulations, chemical dilutions). Some argue they fail without tool integration, while others cite examples of successful problem-solving via code execution.  
   - Criticism centers on LLMs’ inability to grasp context or intent in tasks like self-driving cars, where understanding human behavior is critical but elusive.

3. **Humanoid Robots vs. Practical Automation**:  
   - Comparisons to gymnasts emphasize the gap between robotic precision and human adaptability. A humanoid robot might mimic a gymnast’s routine but fail in unpredictable real-world tasks (e.g., food safety checks).  
   - Users question the value of humanoid forms for robots, suggesting task-specific designs (e.g., warehouse carts) are more effective than "sci-fi" aesthetics.

4. **AI’s Creative Limits**:  
   - While LLMs can generate text, users argue they lack the depth of human authors (e.g., Dostoevsky) and often produce derivative or context-blind content.  
   - Writing is seen as a refined, iterative process where human intuition and experience outmatch AI’s pattern-matching.

5. **Ethics and Reliance on Automation**:  
   - Concerns about overtrusting AI/robots echo Brooks’ warnings: systems like Waymo may reduce human oversight, risking failures users can’t resolve.  
   - Discussions highlight the "hard parts" of AI: generalizing beyond training data, interpreting implicit human communication, and handling edge cases.

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores a preference for incremental, human-centered automation over hype-driven projects. Participants advocate for tools that augment—not replace—human skills, stressing that reliability, safety, and real-world utility matter more than futuristic demos.

### ML on Apple ][+

#### [Submission URL](https://mdcramer.github.io/apple-2-blog/k-means/) | 114 points | by [mcramer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mcramer) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45415510)

Stanford CS229 TA and ML PM Mark Cramer implements k-means clustering in Applesoft BASIC on an Apple II, complete with on-screen centroids and decision boundaries that update each iteration. Using a tiny 2D toy dataset (5 samples per class from Gaussians), the demo reaches 90% accuracy—one point is an extreme outlier that even renders off-screen. The code is organized into subroutines for future ML expansions, uses PEEK/POKE to pause for keystrokes, and draws the decision boundary as the perpendicular bisector between cluster centroids.

Highlights:
- Shows k-means basics: assign to nearest centroid (Euclidean distance without sqrt), recompute means, repeat until convergence.
- Visualizes progress by connecting centroids and drawing the bisector as the class boundary (k=2 for simplicity).
- Embraces constraints of Applesoft BASIC: predeclared arrays, simple graphics (HPLOT), and memory-mapped I/O for input.
- Notes practical quirks: tiny sample size for speed, Gaussian outliers, and off-screen coordinates that can break drawing.
- Framed as “yes, k-means is ML,” echoing its continued role in Stanford’s CS229/XCS229 curriculum.

Why it matters: A charming proof that core ML ideas are lightweight and transparent—and still teachable and intuitive—even on 8-bit hardware.

The discussion around implementing k-means clustering on an Apple II reflects a mix of nostalgia, technical curiosity, and debates about machine learning (ML) fundamentals:

### Nostalgia & Retro Computing
- Participants reminisce about early programming experiences, such as genetic algorithms in Pascal (1992), Apple II projects with slow runtime (e.g., 20 minutes for pattern recognition), and constraints of 8-bit systems like memory limits and BASIC’s simplicity.  
- Some highlight the educational value of retro hardware, praising Applesoft BASIC for teaching algorithmic thinking despite its limitations.

### Technical Insights on ML
- **K-means as EM**: One user clarifies that k-means is an instance of Expectation Maximization (EM), useful for Gaussian distributions, and debates its 90% accuracy in the demo (noting outliers).  
- **ML on Old Hardware**: Subthreads explore historical ML implementations, like PDP-10 and VAX systems, with users sharing links to early ML compiler research. Others humorously note the improbability of running modern ML frameworks on an Apple IIGS (“megabytes of RAM” vs. today’s needs).  

### Challenges & Constraints
- Memory limitations forced creative problem-solving, such as splitting datasets or optimizing code. One user recalls spending days debugging memory issues instead of focusing on algorithms.  
- Humorous comparisons arise between ML and simpler concepts like linear regression or interpolation, with debates about whether backpropagation or attention mechanisms are just “fancy” extensions of basic math.

### Philosophical & Educational Takeaways
- The project underscores that core ML ideas (like k-means) are lightweight and teachable, even on 8-bit systems.  
- Some argue retro constraints (e.g., slow speed, limited memory) encouraged deeper understanding of algorithmic principles, contrasting with today’s “brute-force” computational power.

### Humor & Meta-Comments
- Jokes about AI/ML hype: “ML is just linear math,” “AI vs. ML vs. gradient descent.”  
- A user quips about solving NP-hard problems on an Apple II: “You’d enter machine learning territory… and never return.”

Overall, the thread blends admiration for retro ingenuity with technical discussions about ML’s foundational concepts, emphasizing that simplicity and transparency often reveal deeper insights.

### Jax: Fast Combinations Calculation

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/phoenicyan/combinadics) | 57 points | by [phoenicyan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=phoenicyan) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45418875)

Combinadics: fast, indexable combinations in JAX

- What it is: A JAX implementation for computing the m‑th lexicographic k‑combination of n without generating all combinations. It leverages the combinatorial number system (“combinadics”) to map an index directly to its combination.
- Why it matters: Useful when you need random access into the combinations space, batched/vectorized generation on accelerators, or to avoid materializing all C(n, k) tuples in memory.
- How it works:
  - Represent an index m as a sum of binomial coefficients with strictly decreasing “digits” c_i (the combinadic).
  - Use a “dual index” trick: x = C(n, k) − 1 − m; compute the combinadic of x; then subtract each digit from n − 1 to get the m‑th lexicographic combination.
  - The repo includes NumPy vs. combinadics examples and JAX-friendly vectorized code (e.g., calculateMth).
- Example shown: For n=4, k=3 it reproduces [(0,1,2), (0,1,3), (0,2,3), (1,2,3)] in lexicographic order via the combinadics method.
- Tech notes:
  - JAX-first; uses jnp dtypes and can run on CPU/GPU/TPU.
  - Based on James McCaffrey’s blog and the Wikipedia entry on the combinatorial number system.
- Status: Small, focused repo (≈30 stars, 1 fork) under GPL-3.0.
- Link: github.com/phoenicyan/combinadics

Good fit for: sampling or indexing combinations at scale, combinatorial algorithms needing random access, and accelerator-backed workloads where vectorized index-to-combination mapping beats full enumeration.

The discussion highlights appreciation for the technical implementation and potential use cases:

1. **Efficient Development & Active Interest**: A user notes the package's utility for "active development" and asks if there are similar projects ("nymr" likely meaning "anymore"). The author ("phncyn") responds briefly ("hrd"), possibly acknowledging interest or feedback.

2. **Praise for Code Quality**: Another user commends the project as "great code" and emphasizes its speed ("prjcts fst" → "projects fast"), highlighting its technical strength.

3. **Intriguing Functionality**: A third user describes it as a "fun [and] interesting calculator," underscoring its novelty in combinatorics computation.

Overall, the discussion reflects enthusiasm for the project's efficient design, practical acceleration-focused approach, and niche utility in combinatorial algorithms.

### California governor signs AI transparency bill into law

#### [Submission URL](https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/09/29/governor-newsom-signs-sb-53-advancing-californias-world-leading-artificial-intelligence-industry/) | 310 points | by [raldi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=raldi) | [204 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45418428)

California passes first-in-nation “frontier AI” transparency law; launches CalCompute

- What happened: Gov. Gavin Newsom signed SB 53, the Transparency in Frontier Artificial Intelligence Act (TFAIA), authored by Sen. Scott Wiener (D–San Francisco). It positions California as a leader on AI safety policy while aiming to keep innovation humming.

- What the law does:
  - Transparency: Requires “large frontier” AI developers to publicly post a framework explaining how they incorporate national/international standards and industry best practices into their development of cutting-edge models.
  - Innovation/compute: Creates CalCompute, a consortium within the Government Operations Agency to design a framework for a public computing cluster that supports safe, ethical, equitable, and sustainable AI research and development.
  - Notes: The announcement emphasizes “commonsense guardrails” and a “trust but verify” approach; specific thresholds, compliance mechanics, and enforcement details were not included in the provided summary.

- Why it matters:
  - State-level gap filler: With no comprehensive federal AI law, SB 53 could become a template other states look to—especially around transparency requirements for frontier models.
  - Public compute trend: A state-backed compute initiative could ease access for researchers, startups, and public-interest projects, potentially broadening participation beyond Big Tech.
  - Signal to industry: California is trying to balance safety and growth rather than impose outright capability restrictions—developers should expect disclosure obligations more than hard caps (for now).

- Context:
  - The bill follows recommendations from a first-in-the-nation California AI report convened by Newsom, emphasizing evidence-based policymaking and calibrated transparency.
  - California’s AI footprint: 32 of the world’s top 50 AI companies are in-state; 15.7% of U.S. AI job postings in 2024 were in CA; over half of global AI/ML VC went to Bay Area startups; three of the four $3T companies (Google, Apple, Nvidia) are California-based.

- What to watch:
  - Definitions and thresholds: How “frontier” and “large” are defined in regulation, and which developers must comply.
  - Enforcement and audits: Whether “trust but verify” includes third-party assessments or penalties for noncompliance.
  - CalCompute specifics: Governance, funding, partner mix (universities, startups, cloud providers), and whether it offers subsidized access or focuses on public-interest research.
  - Federal preemption: Potential conflicts or alignment with any future U.S. AI legislation or NIST-led frameworks.

Quotes in brief: Newsom framed the law as balancing innovation and protection; Wiener called it a model for responsible AI; advisors (including Fei-Fei Li, Tino Cuéllar, and Jennifer Chayes) highlighted transparency and scientific review as core principles.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Effectiveness and Penalties:**
   - Skepticism arose about whether the law addresses real-world issues like IP protection and data permissions for LLMs. Critics argued the $10k penalty for non-compliance is too low, calling it a "PR budget line item" for large companies. Proponents countered that penalties should scale with violation severity (e.g., $10M for risks causing death), emphasizing a "trust but verify" approach.

2. **Government Role and Bureaucracy:**
   - Some dismissed the law as performative, with comments like "stupid circle jerk" criticizing government inefficiency. Others defended it as a necessary baseline for future regulation. The creation of CalCompute sparked debate over whether public compute access would democratize AI research or become mired in bureaucracy.

3. **Whistleblower Protections:**
   - While some praised protections for AI whistleblowers, others argued they were insufficient without broader safeguards. Critics feared vague language would allow companies to evade accountability, while supporters saw it as a step toward transparency.

4. **AI Industry Bubble Concerns:**
   - A tangent debated whether the AI sector is overhyped. Some compared it to past tech bubbles, predicting crashes, while others highlighted sustained growth and integration into the global economy as evidence of legitimacy.

5. **Innovation Impact:**
   - Opponents argued the law might stifle startups with compliance costs, but supporters noted California’s dominance in AI (32 top companies) suggests resilience. Geoblocking and regulatory fragmentation were flagged as potential hurdles for compliance.

6. **Political Motives:**
   - Critics accused the law of being a political power grab, with "vague requirements" enabling overreach. Others viewed it as a proactive, evidence-based framework balancing innovation and safety.

**Key Quotes:**
- *"$10k is a sneaky fee... big companies will laugh it off."*  
- *"Penalties must reflect harm—$10M for risks of death."*  
- *"Transparency doesn’t fix today’s problems but prevents future ones."*  
- *"CalCompute could lower entry barriers... or become another govt contractor mess."*  

**Takeaway:** The discussion reflects polarized views—optimism about California’s regulatory leadership versus skepticism about enforcement efficacy and unintended consequences.

### Sandboxing AI agents at the kernel level

#### [Submission URL](https://www.greptile.com/blog/sandboxing-agents-at-the-kernel-level) | 85 points | by [dakshgupta](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dakshgupta) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45415814)

Greptile raises $25M from Benchmark and dives into kernel-level sandboxes for AI agents

What’s new
- Greptile (AI code review agent) announced a $25M round led by Benchmark—and paired it with a meaty technical post on locking down LLM-powered agents that get terminal and filesystem access.

Why it matters
- If an agent can read a file, it can exfiltrate it—no matter how much prompt or output “sanitization” you add. The post argues that safety must be enforced by the kernel, not application code.

The core idea
- Use the Linux kernel’s view of file access (the open/openat syscall path) to systematically deny visibility to sensitive data.
- The post walks through how open resolves a path under the hood (path_openat → path_init → link_path_walk → do_open) and shows where you can force failures to “hide” files:
  - Late NO (do_open): classic permission denial (chmod/ACLs) — file exists, but access is refused.
  - Middle NO (link_path_walk): mount something over a directory to make original contents unreachable; mount checks during path traversal let you “cover” paths.
  - Early NO (implied via path_init/namespaces): make the file system simply not exist from the process’s perspective.

Practical takeaway
- Run agents inside containers to change what the kernel lets them see:
  - Separate mount namespaces and controlled bind/overlay mounts so secrets never appear in the agent’s view.
  - Prefer read-only roots and least privilege; assume anything visible is exfiltratable.
- Application-level filters are helpful but insufficient; OS-level boundaries are the reliable defense.

Nice touch
- The post encourages tracing with strace (e.g., strace cat /etc/hosts) to see openat in action, making the kernel mechanics tangible.

Bottom line
- Treat LLM agents like untrusted programs: let the kernel enforce what they can see and do. Containers (and carefully curated mounts) are the right default.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Security Concerns with Containers**  
   - Users debated whether standard containerization (e.g., Docker) is sufficient for sandboxing AI agents. Critics argued containers alone aren’t secure enough for multi-tenant or sensitive workloads due to historical filesystem exploits.  
   - Suggestions included pairing containers with stricter kernel-level controls (e.g., `NO_FOLLOW` flags, mount namespaces) or opting for VM-based isolation (e.g., gVisor) for stronger boundaries.

2. **Alternative Sandboxing Solutions**  
   - **VMs/gVisor**: Proposed as more robust alternatives, with mentions of gVisor’s syscall interception and user-space kernel emulation.  
   - **WASM**: Some speculated WebAssembly (WASI/WASIX) could serve as a lightweight sandbox, though limitations in filesystem access and tooling were noted.  
   - **Landlock**: A Linux security module was highlighted as a potential solution for filesystem restrictions.

3. **Code Access vs. Sandboxing**  
   - Skepticism arose about granting AI agents direct codebase access. Users argued for API-driven interactions (e.g., exposing only necessary data via controlled endpoints) instead of exposing raw filesystems.  
   - Example: Code review agents could use deterministic PR analysis with semantic search, avoiding full repository access.

4. **Practical Implementation Challenges**  
   - Concerns included the complexity of kernel-level sandboxing, syscall filtering, and maintaining performance. Some dismissed the approach as "rocket science" compared to simpler application-layer filtering.  
   - Others praised Greptile’s kernel-focused strategy but questioned its novelty, citing existing sandboxing libraries and tools.

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - The discussion underscored the tension between usability and security in AI agent design. While kernel-level controls offer stronger guarantees, they may complicate deployment and scalability.  
   - A recurring theme: Treat AI agents as untrusted code, prioritizing least-privilege access regardless of the sandboxing method.

**Key Mentions**:  
- Projects: [gVisor](https://gvisor.dev/), [Landlock](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/landlock.html).  
- Concepts: Syscall filtering, mount namespaces, WebAssembly sandboxing, VM isolation.  
- Risks: Filesystem exploits, data exfiltration, multi-tenant security.

### Queueing to publish in AI and CS

#### [Submission URL](https://damaru2.github.io/general/queueing_to_publish_in_AI_or_CS/) | 88 points | by [damaru2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=damaru2) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45411291)

TL;DR: Lowering conference acceptance rates doesn’t reduce how many papers get accepted per cycle—it mostly bloats the backlog and review load, and disproportionately pushes out “average-but-acceptable” work.

What’s new
- Using a simple queueing model, the author argues that with N new submissions per cycle and a fixed acceptance rate p, the backlog of unaccepted papers settles at roughly N/p. The number accepted each round remains ≈ N, regardless of p. This is just Little’s Law: throughput matches inflow at equilibrium.
- Translation: cutting p doesn’t reduce accepted output; it just inflates the queue and the amount of reviewing needed.

When authors eventually give up
- Add a limit T on how many rounds a paper can be resubmitted, and split papers into great/average/bad (15%/70%/15%) with different acceptance propensities.
- Dropping p from 35% to 20% (with T=6):
  - “Bad” papers abandoned rises from ~60% to ~77%.
  - “Average” papers abandoned jumps from ~4% to ~24% (a 478% increase), and since there are far more average papers, the absolute hit is much larger.
  - Reviewer load still tracks ~N/p, up ~46% in this change.
- So lower p filters some bad papers, but at high cost: many decent papers get rejected by luck/noise, and reviewer time balloons.

Why it matters
- Huge “submission counts” at big ML/CS conferences often reflect a swollen backlog (≈ N/p), not a surge in fresh work.
- Pressure to hit a low target p can mean rejecting good papers to meet a quota.
- Raising p wouldn’t explode accepted counts as much as people fear; in the ideal model it doesn’t change them at all. Alternative formats (e.g., federated conferences) could also help.

Bottom line: Treat paper selection as a queue. If you dial p down, you mostly buy a bigger queue and more randomness, not better science.

The discussion around the submission on conference acceptance rates and academic publishing reveals several key themes and concerns:

1. **AI's Role in Paper Writing**:  
   - Participants debated the utility of LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT-4) in drafting technical papers. While some acknowledge their help in overcoming writer’s block or generating initial drafts, others criticize AI-generated text as often verbose, incoherent, or lacking depth. A sub-thread humorously dissected grammar pedantry (e.g., "feel badly" vs. "feel poorly"), highlighting HN’s tendency to fixate on linguistic nuances.

2. **Systemic Issues in Academic Publishing**:  
   - Many commenters blamed systemic pressures (e.g., PhD graduation requirements, "publish or perish" culture) for flooding conferences with low-quality submissions. The exponential growth of AI-related papers and PhD students exacerbates this, overwhelming review systems.
   - **Credential inflation** was cited as a driver, with academia prioritizing quantity (paper counts, citations) over scientific merit. Comparisons were drawn to financial markets, where metrics like "Impact Factor" act as a "PageRank for academia," incentivizing strategic submissions rather than rigorous research.

3. **Conference vs. Journal Dynamics**:  
   - In CS, conferences often hold higher prestige than journals but may have laxer review standards. Rejected conference papers frequently resubmit to journals, which some argue have stricter reviews but less visibility. This creates a cycle where subpar work persists in the ecosystem.

4. **Proposed Solutions and Skepticism**:  
   - Suggestions included charging submission fees to deter low-quality submissions, but others countered that career incentives outweigh such costs. Federated conferences and rethinking acceptance rates were mentioned, but skepticism prevailed about systemic change due to institutional inertia and metric-driven incentives (e.g., university rankings, funding tied to publication counts).

5. **Cultural and Structural Critiques**:  
   - The discussion painted academia as a "tragedy of the commons," where individual survival strategies (e.g., mass submissions, rushed reviews) degrade collective quality. The rise of "paper mills" and corporate influence (e.g., mega-corporations dominating research) further distorts priorities away from fundamental science.

**Bottom Line**: The conversation underscores deep frustration with academia’s unsustainable model, where lowering acceptance rates merely shifts bottlenecks rather than addressing root causes like credential inflation, metric obsession, and the dilution of peer review. AI’s role remains double-edged—a tool for efficiency but also a potential enabler of mediocrity.

### DeepSeek-v3.2-Exp

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp) | 302 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45412098)

DeepSeek releases V3.2-Exp: an experimental LLM with fine-grained sparse attention for faster long-context work

It’s an intermediate step toward the team’s next-gen architecture, building on V3.1-Terminus.

- Performance: The team trained V3.2-Exp under the same setup as V3.1 to isolate the impact of sparse attention. Results are effectively at parity across public benchmarks:
  - Reasoning: MMLU-Pro 85.0 (same), GPQA-Diamond 79.9 (vs 80.7), AIME 2025 89.3 (vs 88.4), Codeforces 2121 (vs 2046)
  - Tool use/agent tasks: BrowseComp 40.1 (vs 38.5), BrowseComp-zh 47.9 (vs 45.0), SWE Verified 67.8 (vs 68.4), SWE-bench Multilingual 57.9 (vs 57.8), Terminal-bench 37.7 (vs 36.7)
  - Net takeaway: comparable quality with improved long-context efficiency.

- How to run:
  - Hugging Face: convert HF weights to the repo’s inference format, then launch an interactive chat with torchrun (demo code provided).
  - SGLang: Docker images available for NVIDIA, AMD (ROCm), and NPUs; example: python -m sglang.launch_server --model deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp --tp 8 --dp 8 --page-size 64.
  - vLLM: day-0 support with ready-to-use recipes.

- Kernels and tooling:
  - Research-friendly TileLang kernels.
  - High-performance CUDA/indexer-logit kernels in DeepGEMM (including paged variants).
  - Sparse attention kernels released via FlashMLA.

- License and repo: MIT-licensed, code and instructions in deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp. The team positions this as a research release to validate sparse attention optimizations ahead of their next major model.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Cost Trends & Model Efficiency:**
   - Participants debate the rapid decline in AI inference costs, citing a study by Andreessen Horowitz claiming a 10x yearly reduction. Skepticism arises about the source's credibility, with discussions on whether gains stem from hardware advancements (like NVIDIA's GPUs) or model optimizations (sparse attention, caching).
   - Some argue that cost deflation is driven by both factors, though concerns about an "AI bubble" and unsustainable price drops are mentioned humorously.

2. **Pricing & Market Dynamics:**
