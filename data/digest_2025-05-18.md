In the realm of learning and memory enhancement, the power of spaced repetition systems (SRS) is gaining renewed attention. Originally brought into the public eye by Piotr Wozniak with the creation of Supermemo, SRS combines the Testing and Spacing effects to make memorization highly efficient. While traditionally associated with rote learning, these systems can also nurture conceptual understanding, shifting the perception that memory techniques only apply to straightforward fact memorization.

Exploring the landscape of spaced repetition, traditional tools like Supermemo, Mnemosyne, and Anki stand out. However, innovative variations are pushing the boundaries of application, extending from mnemonic aids like the Mnemonic medium and RemNote to specialized learning tools such as Chessable MoveTrainer and literary aids like Readwise.

Interestingly, the application of SRS isn’t just about programmed memorization. They can be crafted to encourage attention, prompt application and synthesis of knowledge, and even support unique tasks like catechism. These "memory systems"—a term some users prefer—are proving versatile.

Yet, challenges to the adoption and effective use of SRS abound. Writing effective prompts is a significant barrier, as prompts often need to resonate personally to achieve the best emotional and educational connection. Moreover, there's a cultural bias that undervalues memory's role in creative endeavors due to past negative experiences with rote learning.

Critics argue that SRS focus too heavily on mere fact retention, failing to allow for natural learning through engagement. Others believe learning should happen "by doing" rather than relying on systems that can often feel monotonous or disconnected from passionate pursuits.

Despite these criticisms, advocates note that when used effectively, SRS can automate rote elements of study, leaving room for deeper engagement and understanding. This is exemplified by stories of successful adaptations of SRS in diverse contexts, from childhood education to complex knowledge domains.

Ultimately, the conversation around SRS continues to evolve, as does the technology and community surrounding it, promising further breakthroughs in the ways we conceive memory and learning. Whether for memorization, conceptual growth, or beyond, spaced repetition remains a fascinating tool awaiting broader experimentation and refinement.

### Climbing trees 1: what are decision trees?

#### [Submission URL](https://mathpn.com/posts/climbing-trees-1/) | 42 points | by [SchwKatze](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SchwKatze) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44018662)

Welcome to "Climbing Trees," a new series dedicated to demystifying decision trees in the world of machine learning! This first installment lays the groundwork by explaining what decision trees are and why they're fundamental to machine learning, often considered the go-to algorithm despite their simplicity and limitations.

Imagine yourself deciding whether to grab an umbrella before leaving the house: "Are there clouds?" "What's the humidity level?" This series of yes/no questions mimics the function of a decision tree. Each question, or node, splits the data into two paths, allowing us to make more informed choices as we progress down the tree towards a terminal node, which provides the final prediction.

In this post, you'll learn how decision trees are structured, their inner workings, and the difference between classification and regression trees. Classification trees categorize data into predefined classes, like predicting whether it will rain, while regression trees predict continuous numerical outcomes, such as estimating house prices.

The beauty of decision trees lies in their simplicity and interpretability. Unlike black-box models, decision trees let us trace back each decision path, providing an easily understandable explanation for predictions. This clarity makes them particularly useful in fields like medicine, where transparent decision-making is crucial.

Decision trees aren't just standalone heroes, though. They gain significant power through ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting, which we'll explore in future posts. For now, dive into this introduction and take the first step toward mastering decision trees and understanding their pivotal role in machine learning.

Stay tuned for the next part of the "Climbing Trees" series, where we'll delve into implementing decision trees and how they evolve into forests, leading to cutting-edge algorithmic solutions!
