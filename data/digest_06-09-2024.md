Today on Hacker News, a user shared their comprehensive review of various indexing search engines, focusing on the top three: Google, Bing, and Yandex. The author painstakingly tested and cataloged different search engines, prioritizing breadth over depth. They highlighted that while many alternative search engines exist, most of them source their results from these three giants. 

The author evaluated English-speaking search engines primarily due to their language proficiency, noting details like "allows site submissions" and structured data support to inform authors about their options. Google, with the biggest index, supports submitting pages and sitemaps for crawling. Bing, the runner-up, allows page submissions without login and shares submissions with Yandex and Seznam. Yandex, originally Russian, has an English version and shares submissions with Bing and Seznam.

Additionally, the author listed smaller search engines with less relevant results, such as Stract, Right Dao, Alexandria, and Yep, each with its own unique features and focus areas. Stract, for example, supports advanced ranking customization, while Alexandria, a new "non-profit, ad free" engine, excels at finding recent pages.
