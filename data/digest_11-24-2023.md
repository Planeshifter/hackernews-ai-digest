Why did we build this? Well, deep RL is a rapidly evolving field with lots of complex concepts and algorithms. We wanted to create a resource that would make it easier for researchers and practitioners to understand and implement these techniques.

In terms of code design philosophy, we believe in simplicity and modularity. We want to make it easy for you to experiment with different RL algorithms, so we've included a variety of them in this package.

Installing Spinning Up is a breeze. Just follow the instructions for installing Python, OpenMPI, and finally Spinning Up itself. If you're feeling fancy, you can also install MuJoCo for more advanced simulations.

Once you're all set up, you can start running experiments. You have the option to launch experiments from the command line or from scripts, and the package provides various outputs and save directory options for your convenience.

The documentation also covers important RL concepts and terminology, as well as different kinds of RL algorithms. You'll learn about policy optimization techniques, including the simplest policy gradient and reward-to-go policy gradient. We also provide resources for further learning.

If you're interested in becoming a deep RL researcher, we've got you covered. We discuss the right background, learning by doing, developing research projects, and conducting rigorous research in RL.

Lastly, we provide a collection of key papers in deep RL and offer problem sets, challenges, and benchmarks for you to test your implementations and measure performance.

Spinning Up in Deep RL is a comprehensive resource that empowers you to dive into the world of deep RL with confidence. So strap in and get ready to spin up your RL skills!

Overall, this documentation will guide you through the important concepts, algorithms, and resources in deep RL. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced practitioner, Spinning Up in Deep RL has something for you. Enjoy your journey into the exciting world of deep RL!

- "lvprd" commented expressing thanks for the addition.

- "jrlw" mentioned that the examples in the resource are not clear and it would be better to give it a try to understand how it works.

- "trnsfrm" responded to "jrlw" stating that the examples are meant to clarify the concept and maybe he/she is pointing to specific references on documentation. Mentioning the Bellman equation describing the optimal value function, they also mentioned that it is something that OpenAI invented and suggested looking into it for more information.
