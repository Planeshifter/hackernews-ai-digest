RxInfer.jl is an exciting new Julia package that aims to revolutionize the way you perform inference in your probabilistic models. With its user-friendly interface and clean specification of models and inference constraints, RxInfer makes it effortless to automate Bayesian inference.

One standout feature of RxInfer is its support for streaming datasets. By utilizing reactive message passing-based inference, you can efficiently process streaming data sources in real time. This opens up possibilities for applications such as tracking hidden states of dynamic systems and gaining real-time insights into complex processes.

Another advantage of RxInfer is its ability to handle hybrid models that combine discrete and continuous latent variables. This flexibility allows you to tackle a wide range of problems and explore the relationships between different variables in your models.

Scalability is also a key focus of RxInfer. The package has been designed to handle large models with millions of parameters and observations, ensuring that you can perform inference efficiently even with complex and data-rich models.

RxInfer is highly extensible, allowing you to easily add custom operations to enhance its capabilities. Additionally, the package supports automatic differentiation packages for parameter tuning, making it even more versatile and convenient to use.

The efficiency and speed of RxInfer are noteworthy. Leveraging the modularity of factor graphs, RxInfer performs fast message passing-based inference, outperforming state-of-the-art sampling-based packages by several orders of magnitude. This makes it an ideal tool for processing streaming data sources in real time.

To help you get started, RxInfer provides examples for solving complex problems like tracking hidden states of dynamic systems and enabling smart navigation and collision avoidance. This demonstrates the power and versatility of the package in real-world scenarios.

RxInfer has been featured at JuliaCon 2023, the largest conference for Julia developers. You can watch their presentation video to learn more about the capabilities and features of RxInfer.

RxInfer is part of the larger RxInfer ecosystem, which includes other Julia packages like Rocket.jl for reactive programming, ReactiveMP.jl for efficient message passing-based inference, and GraphPPL.jl for graph-based specification of models and inference constraints.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ai-system-self-organises-to-develop-features-of-brains-of-complex-organisms) | 259 points | by [timthorn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=timthorn) | [132 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38401544)

Researchers at the University of Cambridge have developed an artificially intelligent system that self-organizes to develop features of the brains of complex organisms. By placing physical constraints on the system, similar to how the brain develops within physical and biological constraints, the AI system was able to solve complex tasks while using little energy. The researchers created a simplified version of a maze navigation task for the system to complete, similar to tasks given to animals when studying the brain. The system gradually learned to complete the task by changing the strength of connections between its nodes. The findings could help explain why many brains converge on similar organizational solutions.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of the research paper mentioned in the submission. Some users highlight the similarities between the AI system's performance and the behavior of biological organisms. They discuss the concept of encoding specific locations in neural networks and mention how Fourier Transform and other mathematical techniques relate to the study of neural networks.

There is also a discussion on the relationship between physical constraints and neural network architecture. Some users suggest that existing neural network approaches can benefit from closely modeling the brain and its logical architecture, while others argue that artificial neural networks may not necessarily try to copy the constraints of the brain.

One user introduces the idea of spatial location representations in grid cells and its potential relevance in the study of neural networks. The concept of uncertainty and uncertainty principles is also brought up in relation to neural network representations. Another user questions whether the constraints mentioned in the paper are helpful for neural networks to optimize towards specific tasks. The discussion then diverges to the invention of helicopters and the distinction between human and artificial intelligence.

Overall, the comments touch on topics such as the similarities and differences between biological and artificial intelligence, the role of physical and logical constraints in neural networks, and the challenges in studying the intelligence of the brain.
