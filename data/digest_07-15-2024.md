Today on Hacker News, a new GPGPU programming toolkit called SCALE by Spectral Compute is making waves. SCALE allows CUDA applications to be natively compiled for AMD GPUs without requiring any modifications to the CUDA program or its build system. This innovative toolkit is designed to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA, making it easy for users to leverage their existing codebase for AMD GPUs.

Some key features of SCALE include accepting CUDA programs as-is, no need for porting to another language, and impersonating an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to ensure existing build tools and scripts work seamlessly. The toolkit has been tested with various open-source CUDA projects like NVIDIA Thrust, Blender Cycles, and xgboost, showcasing its capabilities.

In terms of GPU support, SCALE currently covers AMD gfx1030 and gfx1100, with plans to expand support to other AMD GPU architectures in the future. The toolkit comprises components like an nvcc-compatible compiler, implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs, and open-source wrapper libraries for handling CUDA-X APIs.

SCALE's goal is to eliminate the need for maintaining multiple codebases or sacrificing performance to support different GPU vendors. It offers opt-in language extensions to enhance the efficiency of GPU code, providing users with a seamless transition from nvcc to SCALE.

For those interested in learning more or trying out SCALE, there are resources available such as tutorials, examples, and ways to get in touch with the team through Discord or email at [email protected] This toolkit is continuously evolving, with plans to incorporate more features and support for additional GPU architectures in the future.

### Google now defaults to not indexing your content

#### [Submission URL](https://www.vincentschmalbach.com/google-now-defaults-to-not-indexing-your-content/) | 109 points | by [vincent_s](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vincent_s) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970987)

Google has made a drastic shift in its indexing policy, moving from indexing almost everything to being highly selective. In the past, getting content indexed was like magic, but now it's more like winning the lottery. The search engine now defaults to not indexing most content unless it is extremely unique, authoritative, or from a well-known brand.

The era of "Content is King" in SEO is fading away with the rise of AI-generated content like GPT-3, which challenges the traditional notions of quality content. Google now emphasizes E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) and focuses on promoting established brands over smaller creators.

This new reality means that even well-respected writers with loyal audiences may struggle to get their content indexed if it doesn't meet Google's strict criteria. However, once indexed, content has a good chance of ranking well. The days of quick indexing for new domains are long gone, replaced by a system where Google carefully chooses what content to include in its index.

The discussion on the submission about Google's new indexing policy revolves around various perspectives. Some users express concerns about Google becoming more selective in what it chooses to index, favoring established brands and E-A-T criteria. Others mention the evolution of Google search, AI-driven content, and the emphasis on corporate interests over smaller creators. There are also discussions on the impact of ChatGPT on search results and challenges faced in querying specific content or URLs. The debate encompasses a wide range of topics, including SEO optimization, the quality of search results, and the role of Google in prioritizing certain types of content.
