The largest pirated book repository used to train AI models, Books3, has been taken down after a DMCA takedown request from Danish anti-piracy group Rights Alliance. The dataset contained around 150 titles published by member companies of Rights Alliance. The nonprofit research group EleutherAI, which originally released Books3 as part of the AI training set The Pile, denied responsibility for it. The takedown of Books3 has raised concerns about the use of pirated content in AI training and the accessibility of AI models for grassroots projects. Anti-piracy groups are now focusing on monitoring and taking down other copies of Books3.

The discussion around the takedown of Books3 on Hacker News covers various topics related to piracy, copyright infringement, and the implications for AI training. Some users argue that using the term "piracy" is a form of propaganda and suggest using alternative terminology. Others discuss the potential harm caused by copyright infringement to small businesses and the importance of enforcing copyright laws. There are also debates about the extent of intellectual property rights and whether they hinder progress in science and the arts. The discussion touches on the difficulties of hosting pirated content, the role of AI in generating synthetic data, and the challenges of regulating AI training in different jurisdictions. Some users express concern about the loss of access to books and the impact on grassroots AI projects. Overall, the discussion reflects a diverse range of perspectives on piracy, copyright, and AI training.

Bret Victor's essay, "Learnable Programming: Designing a programming system for understanding programs," explores the concept of creating a programming system that is easily understandable and accessible to people. He criticizes programming languages like JavaScript and Processing for not supporting powerful ways of thinking and ignoring decades of learning about learning. Victor argues that programming should be turned into something that is understandable by people, rather than forcing people to think like a machine. He presents a set of design principles for an environment and language suitable for learning programming. These principles include allowing the learner to read the vocabulary, follow the flow of the program, see the state of the computer, create by reacting and abstracting, and providing identity, metaphor, decomposition, recomposition, and readability in the language. Victor emphasizes that the features of a programming environment or language are not the most important aspect; what matters is how these features convey a message and enable the programmer to think. He gives examples of how a programming environment can make meaning transparent and provide labels and explanations to help learners understand the code. Overall, Victor believes that creating an environment and language that supports powerful ways of thinking and makes programming more understandable by people is the key to getting people to understand programming.

In the comments on Hacker News, there is a discussion surrounding Bret Victor's essay "Learnable Programming." One user shares a link to a video interpretation of Victor's ideas called Leporellojs. Another user mentions that they found it helpful to present programming differently, as traditional text-based programming can be frustrating. They suggest rearranging glyphs, keywords, and sentences to synchronize with new function learning. Another user recommends looking into Glamorous Toolkit for its similar approach.

The discussion also links to previous discussions on the same topic, with some users noting that it's great to see reposts of valuable content and suggests checking out the HN Algolia charts for more curated content. Additionally, there is a user who criticizes the idea of pamphlets written by established programmers, stating that they can be misleading and contribute to bad practices. They believe that personal exploration and questioning are important for successful learning.

Another user expresses their gratitude for the post and mentions that they've seen similar ideas from Bret Victor in the past. They also highlight the importance of understanding programming rather than just learning to code. A user further expands on this point, emphasizing the need for programming systems that support powerful ways of thinking and enable programmers to understand program execution.

Other comments discuss the visualization of program execution and the importance of memorizing vs. understanding concepts. There is also a disagreement regarding the principles of learning programming, with one user suggesting that people naturally cannot understand advanced tools without proper information, while another user argues that people are capable of building their own thoughts and tools.

In a lighthearted comment, one user shares a funny example of struggling with global variables in programming. And finally, there is a discussion about the status of Bret Victor's website, with some users noting that it hasn't been updated recently, while others share a link to a working version of Victor's Dynamicland project.
