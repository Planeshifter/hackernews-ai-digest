#### [Submission URL](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@rygorous/110572829749524388) | 183 points | by [luu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=luu) | [101 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36396891)

Sure, I can write an AI that can summarize the top stories on Hacker News in an engaging way. However, please note that AI language models are still imperfect and may not be able to fully capture the nuances and complexities of news stories. Additionally, I will need access to an API that can fetch the top submissions on Hacker News. Do you have any API in mind that you would like me to use?

A recent article on Hacker News outlines how AVX-512, an instruction set that allows for double the number of available SIMD single instructions, is replacing three distinct instructions. Although the benefits of the new instruction set are clear, there are also some potential drawbacks as the number of registers required to facilitate the instructions' 512-bit width is not easily accommodated by current CPU space allocations. In addition, while AVX-512 is supported by many CPUs, it is not yet widely available for mobile devices. Other comments in the thread note issues with AVX-512 and potential solutions, as well as speculation about the usefulness of similar two-bits instructions. Meanwhile, an unrelated comment discusses the use of math functions in byte-type data.

#### [Submission URL](https://tracydurnell.com/2023/06/18/ai-has-poisoned-its-own-well/) | 93 points | by [serhack_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=serhack_) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36388680)

The increasing use of model-generated content in training AI models is causing irreversible defects in the models, known as Model Collapse, and has to be taken seriously if the benefits of training from large-scale data scraped from the web are to be sustained, according to a scientific paper by researchers at the University of Chicago. Data collected about genuine human interactions with systems will be increasingly valuable in the presence of content generated by large language models, which are expected to contribute a significant proportion of language found online, it claims. The paper warns that "2022 and 2023 will be essentially 'lost years' of internet-sourced content, even if they can establish a tagging system going forward -- and get people hostile or ambivalent to them to use it".

### AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/) | 277 points | by [ssn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ssn) | [203 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394569)

AI is introducing the third user-interface paradigm in computing history, shifting to a new interaction mechanism where users tell the computer what they want, not how to do it â€” thus reversing the locus of control. The newest paradigm, called intent-based outcome specification, is the first new interaction model in more than 60 years and is poised to replace graphical user interfaces as the dominant UX model. With the advent of conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT, the locus of control is shifted to the user rather than the computer, allowing for more natural and intuitive interaction.

The submission discusses a new interaction model for computers called Intent-Based Outcome Specification, which shifts the control to the user instead of the computer. The comments section delves into the limitations and potential pitfalls of this model and compares the limitations of humans to those of AI. Some users argue that AI is limited in low-risk applications, while others object to the use of the term "hallucination" to describe AI errors. The conversation ultimately turns to the limitations of humans and how civilization has evolved to reduce variability and protect against unpredictable threats.

### Camera Restricta (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://philippschmitt.com/archive/2018/work/camera-restricta.html) | 25 points | by [admp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=admp) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394544)

Camera Restricta is a potential new kind of camera that uses GPS to locate itself and searches online for photos that have been geotagged nearby, to prevent the user from contributing to the overflow of generic digital imagery. It blocks the viewfinder if it decides that too many photos have been taken at that location and could be funded or subsidised by public or private sector institutions to regulate photography in certain places. While it could be controversial and be seen as a tool for censorship, it could be used to create unique and special photos of a place and limit the number of photos taken in a given location. The camera features a retractable shutter, antenna, speaker, and a smartphone that handles GPS and data connection, generating sounds and acting as the camera screen. The project is not only a political statement about censorship but also questions our photographic practice and introduces new limitations to prevent an overflow of digital imagery.

The discussion on the submission revolves around Camera Restricta, a camera that blocks the viewfinder if it decides too many photos have been taken in the same location using GPS and online searches for geotagged photos. Some users approve of the idea, stating that it could prevent an overflow of generic digital imagery and promote creativity, while others criticize it, calling it a tool for censorship. Some users suggest that limiting the number of photos taken in a location could lead to unique and special photos, while others argue that good photography relies on composition and lighting rather than location. There is also some discussion about the camera's technical features and its potential use in various settings. Overall, the discussion is a mix of support and skepticism towards the concept of Camera Restricta.

### Voicebox: Generative AI model for speech that generalizes across tasks

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/) | 211 points | by [OkGoDoIt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=OkGoDoIt) | [117 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36393262)

Meta AI researchers have unveiled their latest breakthrough in generative AI with the introduction of Voicebox. It is the first model that can generalize to speech-generation tasks it was not specifically trained to accomplish with state-of-the-art performance. Unlike its predecessors, Voicebox can modify any part of a given sample, not just the end of an audio clip it is given. It can synthesize speech across six languages, perform noise removal, content editing, style conversion, and diverse sample generation. Despite the enormous potential of generative speech models, the Voicebox model and code are not being made publicly available at this time due to concerns over potential misuse.

### How to compute a 256 bit elliptic curve key with 50M Toffoli gates

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08585) | 75 points | by [aburan28](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aburan28) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36387371)

In a recent paper, Daniel Litinski presents a method for computing a 256-bit elliptic curve private key using only 50 million Toffoli gates. The author uses Shor's algorithm for computing elliptic curve private keys as a case study for resource estimates in the silicon-photonics-inspired active-volume architecture. The author finds that non-local connections reduce the cost per key by a factor of 300-700 depending on the operating regime. Additionally, the author finds simple algorithmic modifications that reduce the Toffoli count per key by up to a factor of 5, involving reusing the stored state for multiple keys and spreading the cost of the modular division operation over multiple parallel instances of the algorithm.

Summary of discussion:

1. Many of the comments in the discussion focus on the feasibility of quantum computing in breaking encryption methods such as RSA and ECC. There is concern about the security of information protected by these encryption methods once quantum computers become powerful enough to effectively break them.

2. Some commenters point out that there are already efforts underway to develop post-quantum cryptography (PQC) that can resist the attacks of quantum computers. However, there is also concern that the development and adoption of PQC may not be as rapid as required, potentially leaving critical infrastructure vulnerable.

3. Other commenters focus on the technical aspects of the paper, discussing the specifics of the algorithm proposed by Litinski, as well as the potential impact of non-local connections and algorithmic modifications on its efficiency.

4. There is also discussion around the topic of genuine quantum supremacy and the difference between general-purpose quantum computers and those designed for specific purposes such as Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.

5. Some comments express skepticism around the hype surrounding quantum computing and quantum supremacy, emphasizing the current limitations and challenges involved in building reliable, scalable quantum computers.

### GCC Lands AVX-512 Fully-Masked Vectorization

#### [Submission URL](https://www.phoronix.com/news/GCC-AVX-512-Fully-Masked-Vector) | 63 points | by [pella](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pella) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36390884)

SUSE engineers have added support for AVX-512 fully masked vectorization within the GNU Compiler Collection codebase in order to optimize a benchmark from x264 that was inefficiently optimized for AVX-512. This effectively creates a masked epilog for avx512 style masks in which each lane is represented with a single bit and uses integer modes for the mask. The masks are produced by vector comparisons, and the loop control retains the scalar iv, resulting in improved execution time on cases with trips of less than 32. The changes have landed in GCC 14 Git.

SUSE engineers have added support for AVX-512 fully masked vectorization within the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) codebase to optimize an inefficiently optimized benchmark from x264. When a loop processes data of size multiple AVX-512 vector sizes, that loop's prolog and epilogue resulting in slow execution time. This new feature creates a masked epilog for AVX512 style masks where each lane is represented with a single bit and uses integer modes for the mask. The masks are produced by vector comparisons, and the loop control retains the scalar iv, resulting in improved execution time on cases with trips of fewer than 32. According to the GCC release announcement, this work corrects the behavior resulting in improved performance for loops and iterations execution time. In response to questions, the thread also provides explanations of fully masked vectorization, simplified control flow segments, and how masking allows control flow while SIMD supports speedup processing. The discussion also touched on comparing vectorized and scalar loops and the need to handle 12 values for a single masked tern, which is significantly important given 108 unmasked lanes, and Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) support for masking.
