### Between the Booms: AI in Winter – Communications of the ACM

#### [Submission URL](https://cacm.acm.org/opinion/between-the-booms-ai-in-winter/) | 96 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42196037)

In a recent thought-provoking piece, science fiction writer Ted Chiang critiques the common terminology associated with artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it has historically misrepresented the capabilities of these technologies. He asserts that "artificial intelligence" is a misleading term, better replaced with "applied statistics," as many AI systems primarily operate on statistical models rather than genuine understanding or consciousness.

Chiang's perspective highlights a significant shift in AI research over the decades. The 1960s through the 1980s marked a period where non-statistical methods dominated, particularly during the initial enthusiasm for expert systems. However, the AI winter of the late 1980s crushed this momentum, leading to a dramatic reduction in funding and interest in AI. As a result, many AI-related activities were rebranded, overshadowed by emerging fields like machine learning.

As the dust settled, the AI community diversified, spawning various sub-disciplines that were no longer centered around traditional AI concepts. Figures like Rodney Brooks began to champion new approaches, focusing on embodied intelligence and robot interactions with their environments. This era also saw the rise of genetic algorithms and artificial life, borrowing concepts from biology to create systems capable of iterative learning and evolution.

Overall, the trajectory of AI research illustrates a complex interplay between hype, funding fluctuations, and evolving methodologies. Chiang's critique and historical overview spark discussions about the nature of intelligence in machines and the language we use to describe it, emphasizing the importance of clarity in the rapidly advancing field of AI.

The comments section reflects a vigorous debate surrounding Ted Chiang's critique of the term "artificial intelligence." Several users express frustration with what they perceive as misleading marketing in the AI field, pointing out that much of AI is essentially advanced statistics rather than true intelligence or consciousness. Some highlight the historical context of AI development, noting how funding cycles and shifts in focus have led to branding that often oversells capabilities.

Commenters also discuss the impact of venture capital and the tech industry's tendency to hype new technologies, drawing parallels between past trends and the current AI landscape. There’s recognition that while AI tools can provide significant benefits—like enhancing productivity—they can also lead to unrealistic expectations and potential disillusionment among users. 

Users express skepticism around the technological jargon used within the community and the broader implications of AI systems, including concerns about their tangible applications and the lack of an understanding of where they add real value. A few commenters voice the need for clearer and more accurate terminology, arguing for better reflection of AI’s true capabilities in marketing and common discourse. Overall, the discussion underscores a tension between excitement about technological advancements and caution regarding overhyping their potential.
