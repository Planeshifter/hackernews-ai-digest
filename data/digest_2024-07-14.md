### CURLoRA: Stable LLM Fine-Tuning and Catastrophic Forgetting Mitigation

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/12740116) | 52 points | by [mnoorfawi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mnoorfawi) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40960886)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about a groundbreaking paper introducing CURLoRA, a new method for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) that effectively tackles catastrophic forgetting during continual learning and reduces the number of trainable parameters. By leveraging CUR matrix decomposition within Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), CURLoRA outperforms standard LoRA in maintaining model stability and performance across tasks, while significantly cutting down on trainable parameters. The approach involves unique modifications to the CUR decomposition process, showcasing superior accuracy and perplexity scores, especially in scenarios with limited fine-tuning data. The paper provides detailed insights into the methodology and offers promising results through experiments on multiple datasets. If you're interested in the latest advancements in natural language processing and continual learning, this paper on CURLoRA is definitely worth checking out.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about CURLoRA, a new method for fine-tuning large language models, covers various aspects of the methodology and its implications. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Majromax**: Points out a significant flaw in the analysis of Section 431 related to CURLoRA's decomposition of the original weight matrix using CUR, suggesting that the chosen columns and rows are with respect to inverse contributions towards lower-norm rows/columns chosen. The discussion delves into how the method operates in defining low-dimensional spaces for fine-tuning.
2. **slndr**: Raises concerns about the significant number of acronyms and marketing hype in the field, indicating a need for clarity and precision in communication.
3. **mpssblfrk**: Mentions a strong variant of LoRA and its name in comparison to the acronym LoRA, leading to further exploration and explanation by slndr about CURL and LoRa technologies, highlighting a distinction.

### Solving Path of Exile Item Crafting with Reinforcement Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://dennybritz.com/posts/poe-crafting/) | 86 points | by [dennybritz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dennybritz) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40958436)

The post dives into the world of Path of Exile (PoE), an intricate ARPG game notorious for its complexity. Crafting in PoE involves modifying item attributes to create powerful gear, but the process is daunting for many due to a high risk of failure. Players often opt to buy items instead of crafting them. The article delves into the question of whether an algorithm can be used to learn the optimal sequence of crafting actions for a target item in PoE.

In PoE, crafting involves changing item modifiers through various actions to achieve a desired outcome. The post explains the mechanics of item modifiers, the limitations on the number of prefixes and suffixes an item can have, and the probability distribution of obtaining modifiers based on the item's base type, level, and existing modifiers.

Crafting in PoE can involve multiple steps, including applying currency or using crafting benches, with outcomes being stochastic. The post provides a simplistic example of crafting a Void Sceptre to illustrate the complexity of the process. Crafting in PoE can range from simple actions to highly intricate strategies that require careful planning and knowledge of modifier distributions.

The post emphasizes that determining the optimal crafting sequence for a desired item is challenging, as it may not always be straightforward. The optimal sequence could mean the fastest or most cost-efficient way to craft an item, and experienced players often need to research and experiment before finding a successful crafting strategy.

The article delves into the limitations of using game tree search algorithms like Minimax for crafting optimization in PoE due to the game's stochastic environment and single-player nature. Instead, the post suggests exploring model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms to tackle the problem of finding the optimal crafting sequence for a target item in PoE.
