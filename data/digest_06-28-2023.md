### Junk websites filled w AI-generated text pulling in money from programmatic ads

#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/26/1075504/junk-websites-filled-with-ai-generated-text-are-pulling-in-money-from-programmatic-ads/) | 224 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [119 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36514063)

A new report from NewsGuard reveals that AI chatbots are being utilized to fill junk websites with AI-generated text, attracting paying advertisers. Over 140 major brands are unknowingly paying for ads that appear on unreliable AI-written sites. Despite Google's policies prohibiting the placement of ads on pages with "spammy automatically generated content," 90% of the ads from major brands found on these AI-generated news sites were served by Google. This practice not only wastes massive amounts of ad money but also risks creating a glitchy, spammy internet dominated by AI-generated content. Content farms have emerged where low-paid workers churn out poor-quality content to attract ad revenue. These sites are often referred to as "made for advertising" sites and employ tactics such as clickbait and pop-up ads to maximize profits. The Association of National Advertisers estimates that around $13 billion is wasted globally on these sites each year, with 21% of ad impressions going to "made-for-advertising" sites. With the advent of generative AI, the content farm process can be automated, leading to the proliferation of more junk sites without much effort. NewsGuard has identified around 25 new AI-generated sites each week, with a total of 217 sites in 13 languages found since April. NewsGuard employs a method to identify these junk AI-written sites by searching for error messages typical of generative AI systems. The company's AI scans the websites for these error messages, and then a human analyst reviews them. Programmatic advertising, where algorithms place ads on various websites based on calculations to optimize the ad's reach, is the main revenue source for these AI-generated sites. Many Fortune 500 companies and prominent brands unknowingly advertise on these sites, contributing to their growth. The cost of a programmatic ad is around $1.21 per thousand impressions, but brands often do not review all automatic ad placements. Google, the largest exchange for programmatic ads, has faced criticism for serving ads on content farms, despite its policies against it. Google Ads made $168 billion in advertising revenue last year. While most ad exchanges and platforms have policies against serving ads on content farms, they do not uniformly enforce them. Google stated that the presence of AI-generated content on a page is not inherently a violation of its policies, but it acknowledges the need to stay vigilant against bad actors who may use generative AI to bypass enforcement systems. While NewsGuard found that most of the AI-generated sites are of low quality, they do not propagate misinformation.

### Deep Learning Digs Deep: AI Unveils New Large-Scale Images in Peruvian Desert

#### [Submission URL](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2023/06/23/geoglyphs-in-peru/) | 45 points | by [bcaulfield](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bcaulfield) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36514297)

Researchers at Yamagata University in Japan have successfully used artificial intelligence (AI) to uncover four previously unseen geoglyphs in Nazca, Peru. Geoglyphs are large images made on the ground using natural elements. The team used a deep learning model to analyze high-resolution aerial photographs and identified a humanoid figure, a pair of legs, a fish, and a bird. The discovery process was significantly faster than traditional archaeological methods. The findings highlight the potential of AI in accelerating archaeological discoveries and suggest the presence of more undiscovered sites in the area. The researchers used an IBM Power Systems server with an NVIDIA GPU for model training.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around different interpretations and possible purposes of the newly discovered geoglyphs in Nazca, Peru, using AI technology. One user points out the astronomical significance of the geoglyphs and suggests that they may have been created for regional defense purposes or represent celestial navigation. Another user suggests that the geoglyphs may have served religious or magical purposes, reflecting the thinking of people who built structures with irrational beliefs. Some users criticize the assumptions made about the purpose of the geoglyphs, emphasizing that they could serve more practical purposes related to economics, water resource management, and navigation. There is also speculation about the involvement of extraterrestrial beings or religious rituals in the creation of the geoglyphs. Some users argue for Occam's razor, suggesting that the most plausible explanation is that the geoglyphs were created by humans for religious reasons. Other discussions explore the possibility of communicating with gods or extraterrestrial beings through the geoglyphs and propose different theories about their purpose, including marking landmarks, serving as a form of artistic expression, or reflecting cultural remnants. Additionally, users discuss the logistics of creating the geoglyphs, with some suggesting that the most straightforward explanation is that humans built them by using hand-sized stones to scrape the surface. Finally, there are references to the Burning Man event in Peru and the evolution of human technology over time.

### The idea maze for AI startups (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://cdixon.org/2015/02/01/the-ai-startup-idea-maze/) | 104 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36507010)

In this article, the author introduces the concept of an "idea maze" - a map of all the key decisions and tradeoffs that startups in a given industry need to make. They use the example of AI startups and outline the steps in the maze.  The first step is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) with 80-90% accuracy, as it is relatively easy to build a model that is accurate to this level. From there, the founder has a choice of either trying to increase the accuracy to near 100% or building a product that is useful despite being only partially accurate. This can be done by creating a fault-tolerant user experience (UX), similar to iOS autocorrect or Google search's "did you mean..." feature. If the decision is made to go for 100% accuracy, the key is to obtain more data for training the models. Data is a crucial component of AI as algorithms are mostly a shared resource created by the research community. Narrowing the domain of the problem being solved helps to reduce the amount of data needed. The next step is to narrow the domain even further, building an MVP that is part of the ultimate goal. This allows for incremental progress towards the larger goal while addressing a specific need in the market. Obtaining the necessary data can be done by either building it yourself or crowdsourcing it. Startups often opt for the latter, designing a service that provides the right incentives for users to contribute data. Crowdsourcing data is seen as a viable approach, and the example of Wit.ai, a company that provided a service for speech-to-text and natural language processing, is given. Wit.ai allowed developers to correct errors and improve results, and this training data was then used to make the overall system smarter.

Germany has launched opencode.de, a national code repository aimed at facilitating local cooperation and implementing the country's Online Access Act. This act requires the publication of source code as open source and the checking of components for reusability for the listed 575 public services that must be provided online. The repository aims to foster a community among local administrations, allowing them to share software, exchange knowledge, and collaborate on solutions. The project has focused on the advantages of open source in terms of flexibility, sovereignty, and achieving the government's cloud strategy and Online Access Act goals. The pilot phase, funded by the 2022 federal budget, was successful, and opencode.de is now fully available with active projects. The repository already shows local administrations using it to share configurations, tools, and agree on software versions. This initiative aligns with the FSFE campaign Public Money? Public Code!
