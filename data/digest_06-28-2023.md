### Junk websites filled w AI-generated text pulling in money from programmatic ads

#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/26/1075504/junk-websites-filled-with-ai-generated-text-are-pulling-in-money-from-programmatic-ads/) | 224 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [119 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36514063)

A new report from NewsGuard reveals that AI chatbots are being utilized to fill junk websites with AI-generated text, attracting paying advertisers. Over 140 major brands are unknowingly paying for ads that appear on unreliable AI-written sites. Despite Google's policies prohibiting the placement of ads on pages with "spammy automatically generated content," 90% of the ads from major brands found on these AI-generated news sites were served by Google. This practice not only wastes massive amounts of ad money but also risks creating a glitchy, spammy internet dominated by AI-generated content. Content farms have emerged where low-paid workers churn out poor-quality content to attract ad revenue. These sites are often referred to as "made for advertising" sites and employ tactics such as clickbait and pop-up ads to maximize profits. The Association of National Advertisers estimates that around $13 billion is wasted globally on these sites each year, with 21% of ad impressions going to "made-for-advertising" sites. With the advent of generative AI, the content farm process can be automated, leading to the proliferation of more junk sites without much effort. NewsGuard has identified around 25 new AI-generated sites each week, with a total of 217 sites in 13 languages found since April. NewsGuard employs a method to identify these junk AI-written sites by searching for error messages typical of generative AI systems. The company's AI scans the websites for these error messages, and then a human analyst reviews them. Programmatic advertising, where algorithms place ads on various websites based on calculations to optimize the ad's reach, is the main revenue source for these AI-generated sites. Many Fortune 500 companies and prominent brands unknowingly advertise on these sites, contributing to their growth. The cost of a programmatic ad is around $1.21 per thousand impressions, but brands often do not review all automatic ad placements. Google, the largest exchange for programmatic ads, has faced criticism for serving ads on content farms, despite its policies against it. Google Ads made $168 billion in advertising revenue last year. While most ad exchanges and platforms have policies against serving ads on content farms, they do not uniformly enforce them. Google stated that the presence of AI-generated content on a page is not inherently a violation of its policies, but it acknowledges the need to stay vigilant against bad actors who may use generative AI to bypass enforcement systems. While NewsGuard found that most of the AI-generated sites are of low quality, they do not propagate misinformation.

#### [Submission URL](https://cdixon.org/2015/02/01/the-ai-startup-idea-maze/) | 104 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36507010)

In this article, the author introduces the concept of an "idea maze" - a map of all the key decisions and tradeoffs that startups in a given industry need to make. They use the example of AI startups and outline the steps in the maze. 

The first step is to create a minimum viable product (MVP) with 80-90% accuracy, as it is relatively easy to build a model that is accurate to this level. From there, the founder has a choice of either trying to increase the accuracy to near 100% or building a product that is useful despite being only partially accurate. This can be done by creating a fault-tolerant user experience (UX), similar to iOS autocorrect or Google search's "did you mean..." feature.

If the decision is made to go for 100% accuracy, the key is to obtain more data for training the models. Data is a crucial component of AI as algorithms are mostly a shared resource created by the research community. Narrowing the domain of the problem being solved helps to reduce the amount of data needed.

The next step is to narrow the domain even further, building an MVP that is part of the ultimate goal. This allows for incremental progress towards the larger goal while addressing a specific need in the market. 

Obtaining the necessary data can be done by either building it yourself or crowdsourcing it. Startups often opt for the latter, designing a service that provides the right incentives for users to contribute data. Crowdsourcing data is seen as a viable approach, and the example of Wit.ai, a company that provided a service for speech-to-text and natural language processing, is given. Wit.ai allowed developers to correct errors and improve results, and this training data was then used to make the overall system smarter.

Overall, the idea maze for AI startups involves making strategic decisions about accuracy, user experience, data acquisition, and domain narrowing. By carefully navigating through these steps, startups can increase their chances of success in the AI space.

The discussion on this submission involves several different topics related to AI and machine learning.

One user mentions that their work involves a typing correction project and that they need to crop text messages from traditional NLP corpora. They also mention using NLTK and ChatGPT to generate thousands of believable text messages on various topics.

Another user discusses the use of diffusion models in AI. They explain that diffusion models approximate density estimators and do not require explicit mapping or subsequent step relationships. They also mention that GANs are focused on generating high-quality images and lack diversity.

There is a discussion about using LLMs (large language models) for modeling and generating training data. One user mentions that non-diffusion models tend to perform progressively worse with larger models. Another user suggests that human-created synthetic data is commonly used for fine-tuning models.

Some users raise concerns about the quality and reliability of synthetic training data generated by AI models. They mention that current models do not correctly state the probability distribution and that generating non-mainstream data is difficult.

There is a debate about the distribution of AI models and whether they should be trained on high-level human reviews. Some users argue that AI models should not be trained on human distribution due to long-tail cases, while others suggest that it depends on the specific application and problem domain.

The topic of crowdsourcing data for training AI models is also discussed. One user mentions the challenges of generating high-quality synthetic data, and another user comments on the potential risks and legal implications of writing about cryptocurrency.

Overall, the discussion covers a range of topics including the use of LLMs, diffusion models, synthetic training data, human distribution, and crowdsourcing data.
