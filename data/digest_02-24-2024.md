### GenAI and erroneous medical references

#### [Submission URL](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/generating-medical-errors-genai-and-erroneous-medical-references) | 163 points | by [hhs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hhs) | [138 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39496096)

The integration of large language models (LLMs) into the medical field has sparked both excitement and concern. While these models like ChatGPT have shown promise in aiding diagnoses, there are significant uncertainties surrounding their accuracy and the ability to substantiate their claims.

A recent study by Stanford University highlights the challenges of using LLMs in medical settings. The research found that LLMs struggle to provide accurate references to support their generated responses. In fact, for the most advanced model evaluated (GPT-4 with retrieval augmented generation), 30% of individual statements were unsupported, raising concerns about the reliability of these AI-generated assessments.

The study also introduced an evaluation approach called SourceCheckup, which leverages LLMs to verify the validity of medical references. Surprisingly, the adapted GPT-4 model showed promising results in agreement with physician assessments, suggesting the potential for using AI to scale such evaluations in the future.

Despite the potential benefits of using LLMs in healthcare, the study's findings point to pervasive errors in substantiating claims. Most models struggled to produce relevant sources, with a significant proportion of responses containing unsupported statements. This underscores the importance of further research and regulation to ensure the accuracy and reliability of AI-driven medical assessments.

The discussion on Hacker News surrounding the integration of large language models (LLMs) in the medical field was multifaceted. Some users highlighted the challenges and inaccuracies found in the study involving GPT-4 and its struggles to provide supported references. Others pointed out the limitations and potential misinterpretations of the model's capabilities, such as the confusion around GPT-4's web browsing functionality. The conversation also delved into the possibilities of leveraging AI, like GPT-4, to scale medical evaluations and improve accuracy in diagnoses.

Additionally, there were discussions about the potential benefits of using LLMs in healthcare, ethical concerns related to ChatGPT's influence on medical opinions, the importance of cross-referencing with reputable sources like Mayo Clinic, and the intricacies of training and deploying AI models in critical applications. Overall, the conversation underscored the need for further research, scrutiny, and regulation to ensure the reliability and effectiveness of AI-driven medical assessments.

### Does offering ChatGPT a tip cause it to generate better text?

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2024/02/chatgpt-tips-analysis/) | 242 points | by [_Microft](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_Microft) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39495476)

The recent blog post about OpenAI's ChatGPT system prompts sparked controversy on Hacker News regarding the effectiveness of offering monetary tips to AI models. The use of incentives to improve AI performance dates back to a comedic scene in Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory. The author shared findings from experiments incentivizing AI behavior through system prompts, demonstrating improved results with tips or constraints like a "or you will DIE" threat.

To further investigate the impact of incentives, a new approach called "generation golf" was proposed. By specifying a specific character limit for AI-generated responses, such as 200 characters, the model is challenged to craft concise and relevant content. The author tested this method by instructing ChatGPT to generate stories featuring AI, Taylor Swift, McDonald's, and beach volleyball within 200 characters, resulting in intriguing and creative narratives.

Comparing the distribution of story lengths before and after enforcing the character limit revealed ChatGPT's ability to comply with constraints, albeit with some variance in response lengths. The implementation of mean squared error as a metric highlighted the model's success in meeting the precise character requirement. This innovative approach sheds light on the potential of using incentives and constraints to enhance AI-generated content and could inspire further research in the field.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around the effectiveness of incentivizing AI models using tips and constraints. Some users expressed skepticism about the impact of tipping on AI model performance, while others suggested innovative approaches like "generation golf" to enhance AI-generated content through character limits. The conversation also delved into topics like the limitations of AI models, fear-driven development, the evolution of coding practices, and the ethical considerations of AI interactions. Overall, the discussion highlighted a blend of technical insights, ethical concerns, and creative ideas about incentivizing and refining AI capabilities.
