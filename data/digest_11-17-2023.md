### We Automated Bullshit

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/blog/afb21/oops-we-automated-bullshit) | 354 points | by [fanf2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fanf2) | [315 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38302635)

In a blog post titled "Oops! We Automated Bullshit.", Alan Blackwell shares his thoughts on the role of artificial intelligence (AI) and its tendency to produce bullshit. Blackwell highlights the recent attention AI has received from political leaders, such as US President Biden and British PM Rishi Sunak, who seem captivated by the idea of an AI-driven future where work becomes obsolete. However, Blackwell argues that the problem lies in AI's ability to generate text that "sounds good" but lacks evidence, logic, or truth. He references MIT Professor Rodney Brooks, who describes ChatGPT (an AI model) as "making up stuff that sounds good." Other prominent AI researchers, including Geoff Hinton, echo these concerns, warning that AI systems could become super-persuasive without being intelligent, imitating the worst behaviors of political leaders like Donald Trump or Boris Johnson. By relying on predictive text rather than factual information, these AI systems produce what Blackwell refers to as "bullshit." He cites philosopher Harry Frankfurt's concept of bullshit, which is defined as talking without knowing what one is talking about and disregarding the authority of truth. Blackwell also mentions David Graeber's analysis of "bullshit jobs," where over 30% of British workers believe their jobs contribute nothing of value to society. Graeber argues that these types of jobs, which can easily be done by AI systems, train individuals to generate bullshit. In conclusion, Blackwell raises questions about the future of work in an AI-driven world and whether producing bullshit will become the only kind of work needed.

The discussion surrounding the submission touches on various points related to language and knowledge. Some users argue that language is a representation of knowledge, while others assert that language contains non-knowledge nonsense. The concept of justified true belief is brought up, with some expressing skepticism about the possibility of true knowledge. There is also a discussion about the limitations of AI and its ability to generate knowledge. The complexity of language models and the importance of understanding their limitations are mentioned as well. Overall, the discussion explores different perspectives on the relationship between language and knowledge and the role of AI in generating meaningful information.
