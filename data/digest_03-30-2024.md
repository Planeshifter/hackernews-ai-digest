In a captivating exploration of a military-grade chip from the 7400 series, a deep dive reveals a surprising layout. Integrated Device Technology's IDT 54FCT139ALB chip showcases a unique design with over 1500 transistors forming an orderly matrix, where less than 20% of these transistors are utilized in the circuits connected by delicate metal wires. The chip, a dual 1-of-4 decoder, features a grid of 1584 transistors arranged in nine rows forming a gate array, with each row housing pairs of NMOS and PMOS transistors working in harmony to execute CMOS logic circuits.

Detailed close-up images of the silicon die expose the wiring channels between the rows that connect the transistors into gates via metal layers, akin to standard-cell logic but with a fixed transistor grid resulting in unused transistors. The blog post delves into the construction of a NAND gate on the die, elucidating the intricate arrangement of transistors and metal wiring to implement the NAND function effectively. Similarly, the layout of a larger NOR gate, employing eight transistors, is dissected to demonstrate its enhanced output potential compared to the NAND gate.

This enlightening analysis not only sheds light on the intricate inner workings of this unconventional chip design but also underscores the ingenuity behind optimizing functionality within the constraints of the gate array structure. It showcases how even in the realm of microelectronics, inefficiency can sometimes pave the way for innovation and unique problem-solving approaches.
