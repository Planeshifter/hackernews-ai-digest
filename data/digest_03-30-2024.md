### Invalid SMILES are beneficial rather than detrimental to chemical lang models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00821-x) | 7 points | by [kjhughes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kjhughes) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39874224)

The top story on Hacker News today is about a new study that challenges the conventional wisdom about generating valid chemical structures using language models trained on Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) representations. The research suggests that generating invalid outputs can actually be beneficial for these models, serving as a self-corrective mechanism to filter out low-likelihood samples. The study demonstrates that enforcing valid outputs may create structural biases in the generated molecules, limiting the model's ability to learn and generalize to unseen chemical space. This finding reframes the perception of invalid SMILES from a bug to a feature in chemical language models. The research sheds light on the complexities of exploring chemical space and the potential for more efficient approaches using generative models.
