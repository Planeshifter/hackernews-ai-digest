### Invalid SMILES are beneficial rather than detrimental to chemical lang models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00821-x) | 7 points | by [kjhughes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kjhughes) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39874224)

The top story on Hacker News today is about a new study that challenges the conventional wisdom about generating valid chemical structures using language models trained on Simplified Molecular-Input Line-Entry System (SMILES) representations. The research suggests that generating invalid outputs can actually be beneficial for these models, serving as a self-corrective mechanism to filter out low-likelihood samples. The study demonstrates that enforcing valid outputs may create structural biases in the generated molecules, limiting the model's ability to learn and generalize to unseen chemical space.
