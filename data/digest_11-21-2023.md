Llama Coder: A Self-Hosted Github Copilot Replacement for Visual Studio Code

Llama Coder is a new extension for Visual Studio Code that aims to provide a better and self-hosted alternative to Github Copilot. It uses Ollama and codellama to offer autocomplete functionality that runs on your hardware, providing fast performance and eliminating the need for telemetry or tracking.

To get the best experience with Llama Coder, it is recommended to use it with hardware such as Mac M1/M2/M3 or an RTX 4090. The extension works with any programming language and offers features comparable to Copilot. However, it does require a minimum of 16GB RAM, with more RAM being better, as even the smallest model takes 5GB of RAM.

There are two ways to install Llama Coder: locally or remotely. For local installation, you need to install Ollama on your machine and then launch the extension in VSCode. Everything should work as expected. For remote installation, you need to install Ollama on a dedicated machine and configure the endpoint in the extension settings. It is recommended to use a machine with a good GPU for optimal performance.

Llama Coder currently supports only Codellama as the model for autocomplete. The model can be quantized in different ways, but tests have shown that q4 is the optimal way to run the network. When selecting a model, it is recommended to choose the one with the biggest size and the highest possible quantization for your machine. The default model, codellama:7b-code-q4_K_M, should work everywhere, while codellama:34b-code-q4_K_M is the best possible option.

Llama Coder is available for free and is licensed under MIT. So if you're looking for a self-hosted alternative to Github Copilot with excellent performance and no tracking, give Llama Coder a try!
