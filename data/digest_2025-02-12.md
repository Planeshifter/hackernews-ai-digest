In a fascinating exploration of Unicode’s depths, Paul Butler recently demonstrated a quirky way to smuggle arbitrary data through emojis, based on a Hacker News comment that sparked his curiosity. It turns out you can embed vast amounts of data into any Unicode character, including emojis, using variation selectors—codepoints that modify how characters are displayed without creating a visible difference. Butler provides a detailed guide on encoding and decoding data in this manner, using Rust code to illustrate his point.

While entertaining and inventive, this method does hold potential for abuse, as Butler acknowledges. It could be exploited to bypass content filters or embed invisible watermarks in text. However playful the emoji appears, this underscores the surprising complexity and flexibility hidden in the Unicode standard.

Butler concludes by advising against practical use of this technique, emphasizing that it’s more of a clever misuse than a regular feature. It’s a thought-provoking dive into how seemingly whimsical digital symbols like emojis can hide complex functionalities and inspire both innovation and caution.

The discussion around Paul Butler's Unicode emoji data-smuggling technique explores technical implications, creative abuses, and real-world applications. Here are the key insights:

### **Technical Nuances & Exploits**
- **Unicode Tricks**: Commenters compare the method to buffer overflow attacks, Zalgo text chaos, and private Unicode areas (PUA). PUAs allow custom character mappings for internal systems, enabling hidden data, while variation selectors modify rendering invisibly.
- **Screen Readers & Accessibility**: Screen readers may flag variation selectors, but invisible characters (like PUAs) often render as blank boxes or are stripped entirely, raising challenges for accessibility tools. Terminal behavior varies—some display raw bytes, others mask them.
- **AI Watermarking**: Proposals to use Unicode steganography for AI-generated text watermarking face skepticism. Critics argue watermarking probabilistic LLM outputs is fragile, easily stripped, or bypassed. Alternatives like cryptographic signatures are suggested.

### **Real-World Applications & Tools**
- **Steganography in Practice**: Tools like [StegCloak](https://github.com/KuroLabs/stegcloak) already encrypt and embed payloads in text. Sanity.io’s "Content Source Maps" use similar tricks to trace content origins in previews.
- **Malicious Potential**: Phishing attacks using RTL overrides (e.g., spoofing login pages) and PUAs for covert data exfiltration in APIs or databases are noted. Custom fonts could hide messages visible only to specific systems.

### **Ethical & Practical Debates**
- **Security vs. Misuse**: While seen as clever, many warn against practical use due to filter bypass risks and ethical concerns. Content moderation becomes harder if hidden data evades detection.
- **AI vs. Human Text**: A meta-debate emerges about AI mimicking human writing styles, triggering discussions on responsibility for AI-generated content and detection tactics (e.g., version history checks).

### **Quirky Experiments**
- Users test copying raw byte sequences into terminals, DNS TXT records, or Discord plugins with mixed results. macOS terminals display empty boxes, but decoding tools (e.g., `xxd`) can reveal payloads.

### **TL;DR**
The thread blends technical fascination with caution, highlighting Unicode’s flexibility for steganography and watermarking, while acknowledging risks like phishing and content exploitation. Tools exist, but ethical and practical barriers remain—especially for AI watermarking. Accessibility and terminal quirks add complexity, underscoring Unicode’s double-edged potential for creativity and abuse.

Through this self-exploration, ACD can systematically uncover unexpectedly powerful capabilities and potential weaknesses within these models.

The researchers demonstrated the efficacy of ACD on several well-known foundation models, including those from the GPT, Claude, and Llama series. Remarkably, ACD was able to identify thousands of capabilities that would be difficult for any human team to discover independently. To ensure the reliability of their findings, the team cross-referenced automated scores with extensive human surveys, confirming strong agreement between machine-generated and human evaluations.

By leveraging the intrinsic abilities of foundation models for both task creation and self-assessment, ACD marks a significant leap towards scalable, automated evaluations of cutting-edge AI systems. For those intrigued and eager to explore further, the team has generously open-sourced all their code and evaluation logs. This innovative step enables the broader AI research community to delve deeper into model analysis and drive future innovations.

### Show HN: Steganographically encode messages with LLMs and Arithmetic Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/shawnz/textcoder) | 20 points | by [shawnz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shawnz) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43030436)

In the realm of digital subterfuge, "Textcoder" emerges as an innovative proof-of-concept tool designed to steganographically encode secret messages into seemingly innocuous text. Created by the GitHub user shawnz, this project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform encrypted messages into ordinary text blocks.

Here's how it works: Textcoder begins by encrypting a secret message into a pseudorandom bit stream. This stream is then processed through arithmetic coding, using a statistical model derived from an LLM, to produce text that appears random but is secretly a coded message. For instance, the message "hello, world!" could be camouflaged within a snippet about New Year's resolutions or coffee mishaps, completely unsuspecting to an unknowing reader.

To decode such messages, the recipient must possess the correct password. The message encoding and decoding process involves installing and using Poetry, a dependency manager, alongside the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct language model, which requires a community license agreement.

Textcoder, while clever, currently faces challenges such as conflicting tokenizations and non-deterministic behavior due to the inherent quirks of the Llama tokenizer and hardware variations. These issues sometimes result in failed decodings, highlighting areas for further refinement.

This project stands on the shoulders of significant work in arithmetic coding and steganography, referencing inspirations like Fabrice Bellard's projects and scholarly papers on neural linguistic steganography. While offering encryption features not present in some similar systems, Textcoder opens intriguing pathways for secure communication in the digital age, albeit with an evolving list of technical considerations and improvements.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the technical implementation and challenges of **Textcoder**, a steganographic tool that encodes messages into LLM-generated text. Key points include:

1. **Technical Insights**:  
   - The tool uses **arithmetic coding** with an LLM's statistical model to generate plausible "cover text" (e.g., a tweet about New Year's resolutions or coffee mishaps) that hides encrypted messages.  
   - A shared **context prompt** helps guide the LLM to produce coherent text while embedding the secret message.  
   - Encryption involves a **16-byte random value** prepended to the message, acting as a salt for AES-GCM-SIV encryption.  

2. **Challenges**:  
   - **Non-determinism**: Hardware variations and tokenizer quirks (e.g., Llama’s tokenizer) can cause decoding failures.  
   - **Detection Risks**: Attackers might analyze text distributions to spot anomalies, especially if the LLM’s output is overly consistent compared to human writing.  
   - **Model Limitations**: Smaller LLMs (like RWKV-LM) may perform better for this use case, while instruction-tuned models (e.g., Llama Instruct) might refuse certain outputs.  

3. **Security Considerations**:  
   - Adding **randomness** to the generated text (e.g., arbitrary stylistic changes) could help evade detection.  
   - Concerns were raised about **compression trade-offs** and whether encryption might inadvertently expose patterns.  

4. **Comparisons & Improvements**:  
   - A similar project, [NeuralSteganography](https://github.com/harvardnlp/NeuralSteganography), prioritizes compactness but lacks encryption.  
   - Suggestions include a **CLI interface** for easier context configuration and better handling of partial message decoding.  

5. **Creator Response**:  
   - The developer (**shwnz**) acknowledged feedback and highlighted plans to refine encryption and context handling, noting the balance between compression and security.  

**Takeaway**: While Textcoder demonstrates innovation in covert communication, its practicality hinges on addressing LLM quirks, improving determinism, and mitigating detection risks.

2. **Emotional Labor and Gender Dynamics**:  
   - A central critique focused on the uneven burden of emotional labor in relationships, particularly for women. Commenters referenced a 2018 Oxfam report highlighting how women historically shoulder more household and care work. The story’s portrayal of Thor alleviating this labor was debated, with some framing it as a pragmatic tool for empowerment and others as a reflection of societal failure to address systemic inequities.  

3. **AI vs. Human Relationships**:  
   - Comparisons were drawn between AI companions ($70/month ChatGPT Pro) and interactions with OnlyFans creators ($2400/month), questioning whether both are transactional substitutes for human connection. Skeptics argued that assigning consciousness or intent to AI (“Type II errors”) is misleading, as AI lacks genuine empathy.  

4. **Narrative and Gender Bias**:  
   - The article’s framing of female empowerment vs. male loneliness sparked debate. One user criticized the dichotomy, noting that singlehood is often stigmatized for men (“horrible”) but celebrated as “brave” for women, hinting at unresolved cultural biases. Others saw the AI companion as a critique of patriarchal communication failures in relationships.  

5. **Technological Limitations**:  
   - Comments questioned the realism of AI companions, likening them to “marketing strategies” lacking depth. A subthread humorously proposed testing the AI boyfriend via the Turing Test, doubting its ability to replicate meaningful human interaction.  

6. **Sociocultural Implications**:  
   - Some users viewed reliance on AI for emotional support as a societal regression, while others framed it as a pragmatic adaptation to modern challenges, such as remote work and parenting.  

In summary, the discussion blends skepticism about AI’s ethical implications with broader debates on gender roles, emotional labor, and the evolving definition of human connection in a digitized world.
