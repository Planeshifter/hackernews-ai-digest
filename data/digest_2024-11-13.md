### Apple launches Final Cut Pro 11 with even more AI features

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295486/final-cut-pro-11-apple-announced-ai-new-features) | 18 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42131560)

Apple has unveiled Final Cut Pro 11, revitalizing its renowned video editing software with a host of AI-powered features. This update marks a significant leap since Final Cut Pro X, introducing tools like automatic masking, which allows users to isolate subjects with a single click, and autogenerated captions created locally on the device. While the magnetic mask feature performs well, users may need to make minor adjustments for accuracy.

The autogenerate caption feature, however, struggles with the accuracy of certain words—especially proper nouns, a common pain point. On the bright side, new spatial video editing capabilities cater to Apple's Vision Pro and the workflow enhancements include snappier keyboard shortcuts and the ability to edit 120fps timelines.

For iPad users, notable improvements mirror those on the Mac, such as enhanced light and color editing and more presets for stylish editing. Given the extensive enhancements, existing users can upgrade for free, while new users will need to pay a one-time fee of $299. While these updates are impressive, some users still wish for the inclusion of text-based editing features to streamline longer projects—something that competitors like Adobe's Premiere Pro already offer. Overall, Final Cut Pro 11 strengthens its position in the video editing landscape with compelling new tools for both desktop and mobile users.

The discussion surrounding the announcement of Final Cut Pro 11 includes mixed feelings about the new autogeneration caption feature. One commenter pointed out that while the tool is efficient at generating captions, it often struggles with accurately transcribing common words, indicating a need for improvement in language detection for proper nouns. Another participant expressed a more critical view of Apple's approach, suggesting that Apple software often feels restrictive and lacks the same community engagement as other graphics and video editing tools like Pixelmator. There are also comments on Apple's reputation for being overly secretive, which may contribute to user frustration regarding software capabilities and updates. Overall, while some users appreciate the enhancements, there are calls for more open and effective communication from Apple regarding its software updates and features.
