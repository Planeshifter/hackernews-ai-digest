#### [Submission URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Insect_Micro-Electro-Mechanical_Systems) | 29 points | by [pyinstallwoes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pyinstallwoes) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36664372)

The Pentagon is working on a project called Hybrid Insect Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (HI-MEMS), which involves implanting micro-mechanical systems into insects during their early stages of metamorphosis. The goal is to create "insect cyborgs" that can be controlled remotely through electrical impulses sent to their muscles. The primary application for these cyborg insects is surveillance. The project aims to develop insects that can reach a target located 100 meters away, starting from a distance of 5 meters. So far, researchers have demonstrated the successful implantation of electronic probes into tobacco hornworms and the flight capabilities of a cyborg unicorn beetle. With this technology, the military could potentially deploy these insect spies for reconnaissance purposes.

The comments on Hacker News start with some initial reactions to the news. One user expresses their surprise about the project, while another makes a joke about the integration of bugs into the military. Another user provides an alternative acronym for the project, suggesting that the "MEMS" part could stand for "Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Bio-Entomo Robot MEMBER," adding a humorous twist to the discussion.  One user makes a somewhat sarcastic comment pointing out how interesting it is that the military is funding such projects. They go on to mention that the idea seems straight out of a science fiction novel.  Another user joins in with the humor, mentioning the Fifth Element movie which includes a scene with robotic cockroaches. A final comment with a pun is made about the "Multipass" concept from the same movie.  Overall, the discussion mainly revolves around amusement and jokes related to the concept of insect cyborgs being used for military purposes.

### Apple VisionOS Simulator streaming wirelessly to Meta Quest headset

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/zhuowei/VisionOSStereoScreenshots/tree/alvr) | 395 points | by [ozten](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ozten) | [224 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36668732)

The top story on Hacker News today is about a project called VisionOSStereoScreenshots. Created by a developer named Zhuowei, this project allows users to take 3D stereoscopic screenshots in the visionOS emulator. It has gained a lot of attention, with 259 stars and 9 forks on GitHub. The project involves streaming the visionOS Simulator wirelessly to a Meta Quest headset using ALVR (a cross-platform VR streaming system). While the project is still a work in progress, it has already made significant progress in enabling wireless streaming and is looking to add features such as passthrough and support for Quest controllers in the future. The developer credits @ShinyQuagsire for pioneering the wired Quest Link version of the tool and helping with the wireless port, as well as @JJTech and @keithahern for their contributions in figuring out input handling in the visionOS Simulator. This project is an exciting development for VR enthusiasts and developers alike.

### OpenAI says it could ‘cease operating’ in the EU

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/25/23737116/openai-ai-regulation-eu-ai-act-cease-operating) | 24 points | by [pimeys](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pimeys) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36674187)

OpenAI has stated that it may stop operating in the European Union (EU) if it cannot comply with future AI regulations. The EU is currently finalizing new legislation called the AI Act, which would require companies like OpenAI to disclose information about their training methods and data sources. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has expressed concerns about the Act, particularly the designation of systems like OpenAI's ChatGPT as "high risk", which would subject them to safety and transparency requirements. Altman later clarified that OpenAI has no plans to leave Europe, but the company does have concerns about meeting the requirements of the AI Act. In addition to technical challenges, the Act also poses potential business threats to OpenAI, such as the disclosure of copyrighted data used for training its AI models. Altman's comments shed light on OpenAI's perspective on regulation and its desire for it to primarily apply to future AI systems.

### That Google memo about having ‘no moat’ in AI was real

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/10/23790132/google-memo-moat-ai-leak-demis-hassabis) | 29 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36672274)

A leaked memo from a Google researcher suggested that the company has "no moat" in the AI industry, stating that open-source AI models are outpacing Google. In an interview with The Verge, Demis Hassabis, CEO of Google's DeepMind, confirmed the authenticity of the memo but disagreed with its conclusions. Hassabis expressed confidence in Google's future in AI, citing the competitive nature of the company's researchers and the potential for breakthroughs from the newly merged Google Brain and Google DeepMind teams.

The discussion around the leaked memo from a Google researcher and Demis Hassabis' response to it centers on whether Google truly lacks a competitive advantage in the AI industry. Some users argue that Google's dominance in products like Search, YouTube, and Gmail does give them an edge, while others believe that open-source AI models are rapidly advancing and pose a threat to Google's position. Some commenters also discuss the role of default settings in shaping user behavior, with one user mentioning that Google's default search engine on popular web browsers gives the company a significant advantage.

Others point out that Google's control over Android through Google Play Services also contributes to their ability to maintain influence in the AI landscape. One user highlights the importance of ongoing testing and improvement to stay competitive, particularly in tasks like creative writing and inductive reasoning. They mention the success of OpenAI's ChatGPT and the potential of Google developing an AI chatbot interface.

In response to a user suggesting trying out OpenAI's Bard chatbot, another commenter questions the true endorsement of Bard, pointing out that Google is also well-poised in this area. Overall, the discussion involves a mix of perspectives, ranging from those who believe Google has a clear advantage to those who express skepticism and highlight potential rivals.
