In a recent post on Hacker News, the author discusses the security of 2048-bit RSA encryption after the year 2030. They highlight Canada's suggestion that 2048-bit RSA may become potentially insecure and advocate for a minimum length of 3072 bits. The author traces the origin of the 2030 cutoff to a paper by Arjen K. Lenstra in 2004, where he predicted the doubling of computing and factoring efficiency every 18 months. The author provides a simplified table from Lenstra's paper, showing the conservative and optimistic years for different modulus bit lengths. They then delve into the exponential nature of the increase in capability, illustrating it with the classic chessboard grain problem. However, when examining actual factoring achievements, the author finds that the increase in capability has not shown a definite upward trend, leading them to question the validity of the prediction. They conclude by discussing the basic assumptions underlying the prediction and the uncertainties surrounding software improvement and algorithm advancements. Overall, the post offers an insightful analysis of the security of 2048-bit RSA encryption beyond 2030.

Discussion on the thread seems to be centered around several key points. 

One user points out that Google's quantum supremacy paper from 2019 reports a 53-qubit chip, and by extrapolating from other papers, it can be inferred that quantum computers are growing by about 4 qubits per year. However, another user argues that the growth in quantum computing is not necessarily exponential, but rather linear, and that reports of exponential growth are based on speculation and fictional assumptions.

There is also a discussion about the potential alternatives to CMOS processes for scaling quantum chips, such as alternate lithography techniques. However, it is pointed out that these alternatives face challenges in terms of manufacturing scalability and transmission losses.

The topic of quantum factoring is also discussed, with one user bringing up a record-breaking factorization using a quantum computer. However, another user mentions that factoring certain numbers does not necessarily equate to breaking RSA encryption.

The thread also touches on the idea that the threshold for error tolerance in quantum computing may be a significant factor in achieving practical quantum computation. There is a discussion about the potential for reaching this threshold and the challenges involved.

There is a mention of the progress towards quantum factoring of RSA keys, with a link provided to a resource that tracks the progress in the field.

A user raises concerns about the implementation of post-quantum cryptography and its impact on current encryption schemes. Another user suggests using larger RSA keys or adopting hybrid signature schemes that combine post-quantum signatures with traditional algorithms.

There is a brief comment about the security of 128k 2-megabyte primes, but it is not elaborated upon.

Finally, there is a discussion about the acceptance of the assumptions made in the post, with one user suggesting that 4096-bit RSA may be a more secure option for the long term.
