#### [Submission URL](https://pedrodelgallego.github.io/blog/amazon/operating-model/away-team-model/) | 67 points | by [softwaredoug](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=softwaredoug) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36645306)

Amazon has developed a model called the "away team model" to address dependencies and avoid inter-team roadblocks. The away team model involves a self-sufficient engineering team working on code owned by another team (the host team) to deliver features. This allows teams to work independently and helps accelerate software delivery by addressing roadmap dependencies. The away team model works best when the host team and away team coordinate and collaborate on implementing and verifying changes. However, it is important to note that the away team model can be inefficient and should only be used when necessary. Teams should first try to align features and timeframes with host teams before resorting to the away team model. Overall, the away team model is a powerful mechanism for removing dependencies between teams and keeping organizations nimble.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News is mixed. Some commenters express frustration and dissatisfaction with the "away team model" at Amazon, citing issues such as wasted time, unproductive meetings, and a lack of communication and visibility. Others share similar experiences with the model, both at Amazon and other companies, highlighting the challenges of working on codebases owned by other teams. Some commenters defend the model, suggesting that it can be successful when properly implemented and emphasizing the importance of aligning features and timeframes with the host team before resorting to the away team model. There is discussion about the benefits and drawbacks of different team structures and project management approaches, with comparisons made to companies like Microsoft and Boeing. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and potential inefficiencies of managing dependencies between teams in large organizations.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the complexity of Kubernetes (K8s) and its benefits and challenges in cloud deployments. Some users argue that learning Kubernetes is essential for managing cloud infrastructure, while others find it complicated and believe that it adds additional overhead. Some users provide resources and strategies for learning Kubernetes, while others share their experiences with managing large-scale deployments across different cloud providers. There is a debate about whether Kubernetes is a suitable solution for everyone. Some argue that Kubernetes is a fantastic method for abstracting away the complexities of hosting and non-preemptive versus preemptive cloud providers. On the other hand, some users highlight the difficulties in managing Kubernetes in multi-cloud environments and express that it may not be the right choice for every use case. The discussion also touches on the challenges of scaling containerized applications, the differences in behavior between cloud providers, and the benefits of using Kubernetes-specific cloud services versus general cloud resources. There is a consensus that Kubernetes offers benefits in managing resources and scalability, but it may require a significant learning curve and understanding of the underlying infrastructure.

Lie Ryan has proposed a solution to the threading challenges faced by Python developers. He believes that if free threading is possible, even developers who only work with single threads will still be affected by threading issues. This is because libraries can start background threads, causing threading problems in code that never expected them. However, Ryan suggests implementing a voluntary lock for threads in order to avoid this issue. Other users on Hacker News have expressed their opinions on the matter, with some highlighting the need for specific examples before considering it a significant problem. This ongoing discussion explores the implications of free threading in Python and its potential impact on developers.

The discussion on Hacker News about Lie Ryan's proposed solution to threading challenges in Python covers a range of opinions and perspectives. One user points out that removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python would require significant changes, including rewriting existing C-API extensions. They argue that the effort involved in rewriting and maintaining these extensions is one of the reasons why Python remains popular, despite the GIL limitations. Another user mentions that they have little experience with multithreading in Python and suggests looking up examples online. They express that multithreading is not a common requirement for their personal use cases. Overall, the discussion on Hacker News reflects a range of opinions regarding the proposed solution to threading challenges in Python, with varying perspectives on the need for GIL removal and the potential impacts it may have on the Python ecosystem.
