### What if null was an Object in Java?

#### [Submission URL](https://donraab.medium.com/what-if-null-was-an-object-in-java-3f1974954be2) | 14 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40178325)

In a recent post on Hacker News, Donald Raab explored the concept of what if null were considered an Object in Java. Drawing a parallel between Java and Smalltalk, Raab discussed how Smalltalk's pure object-oriented nature, where everything is an object, differs from Java's approach with null being a special case.

Raab provided code examples to illustrate the handling of null in Java, emphasizing that null is not an instance of an Object and demonstrating how it leads to NullPointerExceptions when methods are called on it. He contrasted this with Smalltalk, where nil is a singleton object instance of the class UndefinedObject, showcasing how Smalltalk's unique approach allows for more seamless handling of absent values.

The post delves into the intricacies of null in Java and nil in Smalltalk, offering a thought-provoking comparison between the two programming languages. Raab's exploration of this topic sheds light on the different ways in which Java and Smalltalk deal with null values, challenging readers to consider alternative perspectives on object-oriented programming.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/what-can-llms-never-do) | 379 points | by [henrik_w](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=henrik_w) | [308 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40179232)

The latest post on Strange Loop Canon by Rohit Krishnan delves into the limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Opus and GPT-4. Despite their impressive abilities in various tasks, these models struggle with some seemingly simple challenges, such as generating wordgrids in different sizes and understanding basic relationships between concepts. 

The author explores the concept of "goal drift," where LLMs have difficulty generalizing beyond the context provided in their training data and struggle to focus their attention effectively. This inherent limitation affects their reliability in inference tasks, as their inability to revisit previous answers or predict future ones hampers their overall performance.

While LLMs can be fine-tuned and prompted strategically to improve their output, the issue of goal drift remains a persistent challenge. As researchers continue to refine these models, addressing this limitation will be crucial in developing more reliable and versatile AI agents in the future.

### Clang’s -O0 output: branch displacement and size increase

#### [Submission URL](https://maskray.me/blog/2024-04-27-clang-o0-output-branch-displacement-and-size-increase) | 93 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40176130)

In the world of assembly languages, clang 19 is making a significant change by removing the -mrelax-all default at -O0 for x86, leading to a decrease in the text section size. This update affects span-dependent instructions, where some instructions can be encoded in multiple forms with different sizes, like the direct JMP/JCC on x86-64. 

The concept of span-dependent instructions, introduced by Thomas G. Szymanski in 1978, refers to instructions with short and long forms, creating a challenge for assemblers known as the "branch displacement problem." Popular assemblers typically follow a "start small and grow" approach, resulting in smaller code sizes.

Within LLVM, the MC library handles assembly, disassembly, and object file formats, with assembler relaxation specifically managing span-dependent instructions. The use of -mrelax-all, a flag in LLVM MC library, impacts the assembly process by potentially starting with the long form for certain instructions on the x86 target.

The removal of -mrelax-all default at -O0 is gaining traction, as it has caused issues with RISC-V conditional branch transforms. Recent developments show a push to remove this default setting, indicating potential size regressions with specific architectures.

Benchmarking results and insights from the llvm-compile-time-tracker highlight the negligible impact of -mrelax-all on compile time efficiency, emphasizing the need to reevaluate its default status. With the upcoming LLVM 19.1 release, the removal of -mrelax-all as the default for -O0 is set to be implemented, aiming to streamline the assembly process and improve overall performance.

The comments on Hacker News regarding the submission about clang 19's significant change in assembly language focus on various aspects:

1. Some users discuss the impact of assembler optimization levels such as -O0 and -O1 on the branch optimization and code size. The discussion touches on the default settings of assemblers like NASM and how different optimization levels affect code generation.

2. The conversation dives into the trade-offs between debuggability, optimization, and code size, citing examples from GCC and LLVM compiler optimization levels. Benchmarking results are shared to emphasize the importance of balancing these factors.

3. Users engage in a technical discussion about assembler relaxation, the effects of removing the -mrelax-all default at -O0, and its implications on code size. There are mentions of specific architectures like RISC-V and concerns about potential regressions with the removal of this default setting.

4. Some users share personal experiences with different assembly languages and compilers, discussing issues related to code size, optimization, and debuggability in various scenarios.

Overall, the discussion reflects a deep technical understanding of assembly languages, compiler optimizations, and the trade-offs involved in balancing performance and code size.

### EyeEm will license users' photos to train AI if they don't delete them

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/26/photo-sharing-community-eyeem-will-license-users-photos-to-train-ai-if-they-dont-delete-them/) | 10 points | by [skilled](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=skilled) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40182832)

EyeEm, a photo-sharing community based in Berlin, is stirring up controversy by quietly updating its Terms & Conditions to allow the licensing of users' photos for AI training. The company, acquired last year by Freepik, gave users 30 days to opt out before granting the right to use their content for software development and algorithm improvement. Despite once being dubbed "Europe's Instagram," EyeEm's fortunes dwindled, with only three staff members remaining before its acquisition. The move has sparked concern among users, who are frustrated by the lack of options for bulk deletion and the lengthy process for removal. Some are now seeking alternatives such as Pixelfed, an open social platform that pledges not to use users' images for AI training. This development serves as a cautionary tale about the implications of data usage in the age of AI.

The discussion revolves around the controversy surrounding EyeEm's decision to update its Terms & Conditions to allow the licensing of users' photos for AI training. One user expressed frustration with the lack of options for bulk deletion and the cumbersome process to remove photos. Another user shared their plan to start deleting photos due to the situation, feeling entirely frustrated by it. Another user simply expressed their discontent with the situation by writing "btch-dlt." Overall, the conversation reflects the users' varying degrees of dissatisfaction and opposition to the changes made by EyeEm.
