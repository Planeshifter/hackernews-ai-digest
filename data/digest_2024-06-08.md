AMD has dropped an exciting surprise for the open-source community with the announcement of "Peano," a new LLVM compiler back-end for AMD/Xilinx AI engine processors. This project is focused on supporting the Ryzen AI SOCs, including the existing Phoenix and Hawk Point hardware, as well as the upcoming XDNA2 found in the Ryzen AI 300 series. The Peano project aims to make the Ryzen AI NPUs more useful under Linux by providing an open-source user-space codebase for compiler support. This move is significant for AMD as it complements their existing open-source XDNA Linux kernel driver for Ryzen AI hardware, which they are looking to upstream into the mainline Linux kernel. The Peano team, led by Stephen Neuendorffer of AMD/Xilinx, has already made the repository available on GitHub under Xilinx/llvm-aie.

AMD acknowledges the importance of this open-source compiler backend in accelerating the growth of the Linux ecosystem around Ryzen AI SoCs. The timing of this announcement, coinciding with Phoronix's 20th birthday, adds to the celebratory atmosphere for open-source and Linux hardware support advocates. While AMD's Ryzen AI journey may have had its delays compared to Intel's NPU Linux support, the Peano project marks a significant step forward in empowering developers to leverage AMD's AI accelerators within the Linux environment.

### LLMs are not even good wordcels

#### [Submission URL](https://demian.ferrei.ro/blog/chatgpt-sucks-at-pangrams) | 7 points | by [epidemian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=epidemian) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40615060)

Recently, the topic of pangrams came up among friends, sparking a quest to create self-enumerating pangrams using ChatGPT. Pangrams are phrases that contain every letter of the alphabet at least once, such as the famous example, "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."  ChatGPT-4o attempted to generate Spanish pangrams but struggled with missing letters like B, J, Ã‘, P, Q, S, T, and X in its examples. Despite this, it managed to provide a correct well-known pangram upon correction, showcasing its language understanding capabilities. 

When tasked with creating a novel pangram, ChatGPT presented a quirky phrase, "El pingÃ¼ino Ã±ato y jovial, experto en boxeo, lanzÃ³ su eficaz jaque mate a la rÃ¡pida bruja del volcÃ¡n." However, this phrase was missing the letters H, K, and W. After being informed of the error, ChatGPT swiftly identified the missing letters and aimed to create a complete pangram. Overall, the experiment with pangrams and ChatGPT highlighted the intricacies of language generation and the importance of accuracy and attention to detail when dealing with linguistic tasks.

The discussion revolves around the exploration of language generation through the use of ChatGPT for crafting pangrams. The initial comment highlights the challenge of generating a novel pangram in Spanish using ChatGPT-4o due to missing letters and the importance of verifying each step. Further conversation delves into the intricacies of the process, including the technique of selecting random letters and ensuring grammatical correctness. Another reply reflects on the fascination with improving Language Model Tasks (LLMs) through specific strategies and effective utilization, emphasizing the need for thoughtful approaches to working with LLMs.

Moreover, the discussion addresses the importance of intelligently guiding language models like ChatGPT, rather than relying solely on random phrases, in order to generate successful pangrams. It also touches upon the significance of self-check mechanisms and contrasting the ability of LLMs to human reasoning. The engagement underscores the critical role of intelligence and problem-solving strategies in working with language models, emphasizing the need to consider constraints and possibilities step by step for effective outcomes.
