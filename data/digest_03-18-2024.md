### YouTube now requires to label their realistic-looking videos made using AI

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/how-were-helping-creators-disclose-altered-or-synthetic-content/) | 764 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [437 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39746468)

YouTube is introducing a new tool that will require creators to disclose when their content includes altered or synthetic media, such as generative AI, to provide more transparency to viewers. The disclosure will appear as labels in the video description or on the front of the video player, helping viewers understand if the content they are seeing could be mistaken for real. The goal is to strengthen trust between creators and their audience by ensuring transparency.

Creators will need to disclose content that uses the likeness of a realistic person, alters footage of real events or places, or generates realistic scenes. However, disclosures are not required for content that is clearly unrealistic, animated, includes special effects, or uses generative AI for production assistance. The labels will be rolled out across all YouTube platforms, with a more prominent label for videos on sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance.

While YouTube aims to give creators time to adjust to the new process, enforcement measures may be considered for those who consistently do not disclose information about altered or synthetic content. In some cases, YouTube may add a label to a video even if the creator has not disclosed it, especially if the content has the potential to confuse or mislead viewers. This initiative reflects YouTube's commitment to increasing transparency around digital content and collaboration with industry organizations like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

Furthermore, YouTube continues to work on an updated privacy process for requesting the removal of AI-generated or synthetic content that simulates identifiable individuals. Creators remain central to YouTube, playing a vital role in helping audiences navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI and technology. The platform aims to empower human creativity while promoting transparency and responsible use of AI.

The discussion on the submission about YouTube introducing a new tool for creators to disclose altered or synthetic content includes various viewpoints:

1. **jjcm** brings up the importance of starting small with AI and learning from it. They also mention potential legal issues and the necessity of clearly labeling altered content.
2. **OscarTheGrinch** discusses the complexities of AI classification, regulation, and the potential misuse of AI-generated content like deepfakes.
3. **lctrndd** points out the difficulty in discriminating between real and altered content using AI.
4. **AnthonyMouse** emphasizes the significance of trust in differentiating between real and altered events, as well as the prevention of misleading information.
5. **mzlx** discusses the technical aspects of verifying the authenticity of images or videos, mentioning cryptographic signatures and sensor data.
6. **rbrtlgrnt** acknowledges the existence of AI-generated content dating back to 1997.
7. **wptr** highlights the importance of focusing on content provenance to establish credibility and prevent misleading information.
8. Subsequent comments discuss the challenges of verifying authenticity in images or videos, potential technological solutions, and the importance of security measures in hardware-backed security and trusted execution environments.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/dibyendumajumdar/ravi) | 81 points | by [InitEnabler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=InitEnabler) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39746195)

Today on Hacker News, a project called Ravi caught the attention with its unique approach to enhancing Lua. Ravi is a dialect of Lua that introduces limited optional static typing and features a powerful JIT compiler fueled by MIR, along with support for AOT compilation to native code. The name "Ravi" is inspired by the Sanskrit word for the Sun, connecting it to Lua's predecessor, Sol. While Lua is known for being a small embeddable dynamic language, Ravi aims to boost performance by adding static typing without compromising the compatibility with Lua programs. Unlike other attempts like Typed Lua, which focus on adding static type checks without modifying the VM, Ravi leverages type information for efficiency in JIT compilation while maintaining language safety and usability for all programmers. For those interested, Ravi also offers a Visual Studio Code debugger extension, a new compiler framework for JIT and AOT compilation, and AOT Compilation to shared libraries as preview features. It's definitely an interesting project worth exploring further!
