#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) | 282 points | by [Garcia98](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Garcia98) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36064568)

A new approach to finetuning quantized language models has been presented in a paper called QLoRA by Tim Dettmers and three other authors. The approach reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. The team use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models and provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations. They find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. The team release all of their models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.

However, some users on Hacker News commented that the testing of the GPT-4 models was not comprehensive and may not be trustworthy for evaluation purposes. Other discussions revolved around the benefits and challenges of open-source AI models, and the importance of integrating AI models into existing systems and platforms. The discussion also touched on the limitations of AI models in processing messy and imperfect data and the challenges of AI integration into different platforms.
