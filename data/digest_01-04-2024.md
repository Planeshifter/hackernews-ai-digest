A new study from Global Fishing Watch has revealed that 75% of the world's industrial fishing vessels are hidden from public view. The groundbreaking study used machine learning and satellite imagery to create the first-ever global map of large vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure. It identified a significant amount of activity that was previously "dark" to public monitoring systems. This study sheds light on the extensive and intensifying human activity at sea, providing valuable insights for protecting and managing natural resources. It also highlights the potential of this technology to tackle climate change and improve ocean management and transparency.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of tracking fishing vessels and the implications of the study's findings. 
One commenter points out that different countries have different laws regarding broadcasting positions of fishing vessels, with Norway requiring it and the UK not. They argue that some systems wouldn't broadcast positions at all, and that machine learning-based systems could help analysts spot patterns in fishing spaces. However, concerns about privacy are also raised, as sharing vessel positions raises issues about enforcement and resources for fighting illegal fishing. 
Another commenter brings up the use of satellites and naval radar detectors to track ships, highlighting the military capabilities in place. However, they also note that military intelligence capabilities are most likely kept separate from regulatory agencies. 
The discussion also touches on the existing regulations for fishing vessels, with one commenter mentioning that EU regulations require vessels over 15 meters to have AIS, but enforcement and effectiveness vary across jurisdictions. The issue of privacy is brought up again, with concerns about the lack of coverage for smaller fishing vessels and the potential for abuse of tracking systems. 
There is a side discussion about the use of ADS-B (Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast) technology in aviation and the privacy concerns associated with it. Some commenters discuss the limitations and potential abuse of tracking technologies. 
Other comments suggest using ML-assisted tools for detection and analysis, highlight the commercial opportunities in the field, and discuss the options for tracking planes and drones. 

Overall, the discussion revolves around the trade-off between privacy and transparency, the challenges of enforcement and regulating fishing vessels, and the potential for technological solutions in monitoring and managing human activity at sea.

Zed, a popular text editor, has announced the production release of GPUI 2, its new UI framework. This update brings significant improvements to Zed's user experience and speed. The team behind Zed has rewritten the UI framework from scratch, incorporating lessons learned over the past two years of working with UI in Rust. The new GPUI 2 offers better ergonomics for contributors, making it more enjoyable to work on and allowing for faster shipping. Additionally, this update lays a solid foundation for upcoming enhancements, including multi-platform support and animation. To upgrade to GPUI 2, the team cloned most of their crates and added a new version suffixed with 2, finally deleting the old version and crates. The revamped version of Zed has been extensively tested by the team for the past 2-3 weeks and is now available for users to try out as well. The majority of the improvements are internal, but one popular user request has been fulfilled: the ability to customize and scale the UI font. The team plans to release more preview versions as they work through remaining issues, and they do not anticipate any major stable releases until the preview is ready to be promoted. Upon reaching stable status, Zed will also be open sourced. The team encourages users to provide feedback and assistance in identifying any regressions. The upcoming open source release will allow for even deeper collaboration and contributions from the community. Exciting times lie ahead for Zed as it continues to evolve and grow. Interested users can download and try out Zed today on macOS.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around Zed's new UI framework, GPUI 2, and its release for macOS. One commenter raises concerns about the exclusive focus on macOS, pointing out that it excludes 80% of computer users and limits the reach of the software. Another commenter counters this argument, stating that many landmark software applications like PowerPoint, Photoshop, and Excel were initially released for Mac and that it is a valid strategy to focus on one platform initially. 
Some users express their positive experiences with Zed, praising its helpful features and smooth collaboration capabilities. However, there are also some concerns raised, such as blurry fonts on Linux and Windows and the potential limitations of GPUI in terms of windowing and GPU usage. 
There is a discussion about the roadmap for Zed, with one commenter mentioning the plan to introduce paid features and multiplayer functionality, while another expresses frustration with a previous version of Zed that stopped working and hopes for a fix in the future. 
Additionally, there are suggestions from users for learning resources related to Rust and discussions around the need for support on other operating systems. The Zed team responds to these comments by mentioning that they are working on multi-platform support and that they have identified and addressed issues on GitHub.

Researchers have used deep learning and satellite imagery to create the first global map of vessel traffic and offshore infrastructure, revealing previously unknown industrial activity at sea. The maps, published in the journal Nature, indicated that 75% of the world's industrial fishing vessels and up to 30% of transport and energy vessels are not publicly tracked. The researchers, led by Google-backed nonprofit Global Fishing Watch, stated that these blind spots could hinder global conservation efforts and called for a more accurate picture to protect the world's oceans and fisheries. The study used 2,000 terabytes of imagery from the European Space Agency's Sentinel-1 satellite constellation and three deep-learning models to classify vessels and estimate their size. The data revealed an explosion of offshore energy development, with wind turbines outnumbering oil structures by the end of 2020.
