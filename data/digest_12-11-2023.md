#### [Submission URL](https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/2023/8/) | 74 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38605477)

In his recent article, Phil Nash explores the hidden depths of the <input> element in HTML. While most elements behave similarly, the <input> element offers 22 different types that not only affect its behavior but also its visual appearance. Nash goes beyond the different types and dives into the lesser-known attributes that can make the <input> element more usable, accessible, and versatile.

One attribute Nash discusses is the inputmode attribute, which allows you to optimize the keyboard for the expected input. For example, setting inputmode to "email" when expecting an email address will bring up the @ symbol on the main keyboard. Likewise, setting it to "numeric" or "decimal" when expecting a number will display the number keypad. This feature is especially useful when the input type of "number" is not appropriate.

Nash also mentions the readonly attribute as an alternative to the disabled attribute. While disabled elements are not accessible to users of assistive technologies and their contents are not submitted with the form, readonly elements remain accessible and will be submitted with the rest of the inputs. He advises testing the support for readonly with different screen readers before implementing it.

Another fascinating attribute Nash explores is the capture attribute, which allows users to access their device camera directly from a file upload <input>. By specifying the capture attribute and providing hints for which camera to use, users can take pictures or record videos without the need for JavaScript.

Lastly, Nash touches on the spellcheck attribute, which triggers the browser's spellchecking capability on elements with contenteditable="true" or <input> elements. He recommends using the spellcheck attribute to ensure consistent behavior across browsers.

Overall, Nash's article sheds light on the diverse capabilities of the <input> element and provides valuable insights into making the most of its hidden attributes.

The discussion on this article covers several points. One comment mentions that it's important not to capitalize certain words in input labels as it can make users unhappy. Another comment highlights the need to remember that the zip code field is not always a text field and should allow alphanumeric values. This leads to a discussion about the difference between postal codes in different countries. There is also a comment regarding self-closing tags in HTML and how they are not valid in HTML but are mandatory in XHTML. Trailing slashes in elements are mentioned, with some clarification that they are invalid in HTML unless the element is void. Another discussion revolves around the spellchecking service in browsers and how it works for different fields. It is mentioned that some browsers send the contents of input elements to a network for spellchecking. There's also a comment about the nuances of spellcheck behavior in different browsers. Another interesting point raised is about the accessibility of disabled elements and how they can impact disabled users' ability to work on projects. Finally, an apology is made for not being helpful to disabled users and a change in approach is promised.
