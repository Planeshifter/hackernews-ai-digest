RemoveWindowsAI is a popular PowerShell script (MIT-licensed, ~3.9k stars) that strips Windows 11 (25H2 and beyond) of Microsoft’s expanding AI stack—aimed at users worried about privacy, performance, or bloat. It targets Copilot, Recall, AI features in Paint and Notepad (Rewrite), Edge integrations, Input Insights/typing telemetry, Voice/Voice Access, “AI Fabric” services, AI Actions, and related search/UI hooks.

Highlights
- Deep removal, not just toggles: disables registry/policies, deletes Appx (including “nonremovable” and WindowsWorkload), removes hidden CBS packages and files, and force-deletes Recall tasks.
- Blocks reinstalls: installs a custom Windows Update package to prevent AI components from reappearing via CBS.
- UI or headless: offers an interactive launcher plus non-interactive flags like -nonInteractive, -AllOptions, and per-feature options.
- Safety net: optional backup mode enables full reversion; a revert mode is provided.
- Scope: tracks the latest stable Windows builds (not Insider) and invites issues for new AI features/keys.
- Caveats: must run as admin, on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (not PowerShell 7); AV tools may flag it (false positives per author). As it modifies CBS and core packages, test in a VM and review the script before use—future updates or features may break or be removed.

**User Ownership and Microsoft’s Intent**
The discussion highlights a pervading sense of disenfranchisement, with users arguing that the operating system no longer serves the owner but rather functions as a data-harvesting platform for Microsoft. Commenters describe the effort required to permanently remove these features—and Microsoft's persistence in reinstalling them—as evidence of "user-hostile" mechanics. This sparked nostalgia for older, quieter OS versions (like Windows 9x/NT) and comparisons to Microsoft's 1990s "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" culture, which many feel is still embedded in the company's DNA.

**Technical Implementation and Alternatives**
*   **LTSC as a solution:** Several users suggest that rather than scrubbing consumer Windows, it is easier and cleaner to install **Windows LTSC** (Long-Term Servicing Channel), usually via massgrave methods, to avoid bloat by default.
*   **Security habits:** The script's installation method (`irm ... | iex`) drew comparisons to Linux's `curl | bash` convention; while common for tools like Windows Activation Scripts (MAS), users debated the security implications of remote string execution.
*   **PowerShell Versions:** There was specific technical commentary regarding the script's reliance on Legacy PowerShell 5.1, highlighting surprise that the newer PowerShell 7 lacks the backward compatibility to handle these specific core OS manipulations.

**AI Utility vs. "Wall Street Posturing"**
Skepticism surrounds the AI features themselves. Users argued that the rapid integration of Copilot and Recall is "signaling to Wall Street" to boost stock prices rather than addressing user needs, often citing that basic features (like text selection in IDEs) remain buggy while AI is forced in. While some users see potential value in local LLMs/NPUs, the consensus leans toward viewing cloud-tethered OS features as intrusion or "trespassing" on personal devices.
