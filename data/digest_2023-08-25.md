#### [Submission URL](https://scriv.ai/guides/retrieval-augmented-generation-overview/) | 128 points | by [czue](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=czue) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37261198)

In a recent post on Hacker News, the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) was explored in the context of building domain-specific chatbots. The post highlighted an open-source library called LangChain that can easily create chatbots for Q&A purposes on any website or document. With just three lines of code, developers can leverage LangChain to build powerful chatbots that provide specific answers to user queries.

The post explained that RAG, or retrieval augmented generation, is the process of supplementing a user's input to a large language model (LLM) with additional information retrieved from external sources. This additional information enriches the response generated by the language model. A diagram was provided to illustrate the workflow of RAG, starting with the user's question, followed by the retrieval of relevant content from a knowledge base, and finally, the generation of an answer by the language model.

The article emphasized the importance of the retrieval step, which involves searching for the most relevant information to answer the user's query. It highlighted the reasons for not sending the entire knowledge base to the language model, such as model limitations, cost, and the effectiveness of providing small amounts of relevant information.

To generate an answer, the post explained that language models like ChatGPT rely on prompts and messages. The system prompt, which provides overall guidance to the language model, can be customized to instruct the model to utilize the extracted knowledge base information for answering the question. The format of the knowledge base documents passed to the language model was also outlined in the post.

Overall, the article aimed to provide a high-level overview of RAG and its implementation in building domain-specific chatbots. It provided valuable insights for both developers interested in building such bots and non-developers looking to make the most of AI tools for their datasets.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission touched on various aspects related to retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and building domain-specific chatbots. Here are some key points from the discussion:

- Some users found the concept of RAG interesting and discussed practical implementation details. They mentioned the importance of testing frameworks and datasets to ensure the effectiveness of the chatbots.
- The LangChain library was praised for its ease of use and ability to quickly create chatbots. However, there were some suggestions to improve the documentation and code quality.
- Testing the performance of RAG systems was discussed, with suggestions to consider slow ranking-based metrics, offline precision recall, normalized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG), and mean reciprocal rank (MRR).
- The contrasting ideas of the capabilities of RAG and the difficulty organizations face in providing meaningful and cost-effective results were debated.
- The topic of vectorizing chunks of data and the use of semantic search were explored. Users shared resources on semantic search, index embeddings, and the benefits of using them in RAG systems.
- There were discussions about the advantages of using semantic search over keyword search and the complexity of implementing semantic search algorithms like Lucene.

Additionally, there were discussions around handling real-time streaming data and refreshing systems, the impact of document context on model performance, the use of embeddings and vectorizers, and the resources and research papers related to RAG.

### Show HN: PlotAI – Create Plots in Python and Matplotlib with LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mljar/plotai) | 50 points | by [pplonski86](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pplonski86) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37260913)

PlotAI is a new Python library that makes it incredibly easy to create plots in Python using Matplotlib. The library harnesses the power of the LLM (Language Models for Plots) to generate the necessary Python code for creating plots based on user input. Here's how it works: users provide a DataFrame and a prompt, and PlotAI constructs a prompt for the LLM that includes the first five rows of the DataFrame and the user's prompt. The LLM then generates Python code as output, which is executed and the resulting plot is displayed. The PlotAI API is incredibly simple, with just one method called `make()`. Users can use this method in Python scripts and notebooks (such as Jupyter, Colab, and VS Code) to create plots. To get started with PlotAI, users need to install the PlotAI package (`pip install plotai`) and provide their OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. Once that's done, they can import PlotAI and start making plots using just a single line of code. While PlotAI is currently in an experimental form, there are plans to extend its compatibility to other LLM models in the future. However, it's important to note that PlotAI sends the first five rows of the DataFrame to the OpenAI ChatGPT model, so users should remove or encode any sensitive data before using it. Additionally, since PlotAI executes the Python code returned by the LLM, caution should be exercised, and it would be beneficial to have the option to review the response code before execution. The developers of PlotAI provide it "as is," without any warranty, and users are responsible for any risks associated with its use. It's also important to note that the use of OpenAI language models can be costly due to token usage, so users should monitor and manage their own token usage to avoid unexpected charges. Overall, PlotAI aims to make plot generation in Python more accessible and intuitive for users. With its simplicity and integration with LLM technology, creating visualizations has never been easier.

The discussion around the PlotAI submission on Hacker News covers a few different points:

1. A user suggests exploring Vega and Vega-Lite for visualization grammar and mentions the use of Vegavoyager and CompassQL for chart recommendations.
2. Another user mentions the potential benefits of using OpenAI's language models to generate synthetic data for graphing but raises concerns about the formatting and potential misuse.
3. A user comments on the potential usefulness of LLMs like the ones used by PlotAI and suggests the Code Llama tool as an alternative with the ability to generate appropriate chart types based on natural language metadata.
4. One user appreciates the simplicity of PlotAI's API and suggests an example of how to use it in Python scripts and notebooks.
5. There is a discussion about the capabilities of the LLM model in understanding and generating prompt-specific Python code and surprise at its ability to generalize from the first five rows of a DataFrame.
6. Another conversation arises about a potential major acquisition and ML projects, with one user seeking advice on the topic.
7. Lastly, there is a short exchange regarding string arguments and comments in code.

Overall, the discussion includes appreciation for PlotAI's simplicity, suggestions for alternative tools, concerns about data formatting and usage, and unrelated conversations about ML and coding practices.
