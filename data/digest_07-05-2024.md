OpenAI's Mac desktop app for ChatGPT garnered attention recently, but not for the right reasons. It was revealed that user chats were stored in plain text, posing a serious security risk. Any bad actor gaining access to the machine could easily read all conversations without permission. Now, after an update, the local chats are encrypted, addressing the issue to some extent. This development raises concerns, especially as OpenAI is partnered with Apple for chat bot services in Siri. The app is only available via direct download from OpenAI's website, bypassing Apple's App Store security standards. If you're using the app, make sure to update it promptly for improved security.

1. __jonas commented that it is weird that user chats were stored in plain text, as it should be protected in the macOS app sandboxing. They expressed surprise at the lack of encryption in the app.

2. bffngtn asked if encrypting the data on the machine would solve the concerns of unauthorized access to unencrypted things, and ponty_rick mentioned that the concern lies in the accessibility of data, regardless of encryption, and the lack of control with App Store data storage.

3. rdsrk discussed ArsTechnica's reporting on privacy concerns with some apps not respecting sensitive data, emphasizing the need for more meaningful discussions and responsible reporting.

4. msl highlighted the common practice of apps storing sensitive data without encryption, with mrtsthh mentioning that some apps unnecessarily handle data when there are system-level encryption options like FileVault available.

5. jg mentioned that not all apps enforce encryption, especially for dealing with local data, pointing out solutions like FileWarden, BitLocker, and LUKS for corporate environments.

6. lrwbwrkhv expressed disappointment in the lack of expectation for encrypted data storage in a desktop app, emphasizing the importance of securely storing data regardless of its nature.
