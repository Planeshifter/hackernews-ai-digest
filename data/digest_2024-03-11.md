### Show HN: Goqite, a persistent message queue Go library built on SQLite

#### [Submission URL](https://www.goqite.com) | 93 points | by [markusw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=markusw) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39666467)

Today on Hacker News, a new persistent message queue Go library called goqite was released. This library, pronounced as Go-queue-ite, is built on SQLite and draws inspiration from AWS SQS while keeping things simpler. Developers can easily use this library by fetching it from GitHub using the command `go get github.com/maragudk/goqite`. With goqite, you can set up your own named queues for message processing. Messages can be sent with customizable features such as message delay, and the library also provides options for message redelivery timeout and maximum receive count. 

The library allows you to work with arbitrary byte data for message bodies, giving you flexibility in the payload you send. Processing a message involves receiving it from the queue, potentially extending the timeout for more processing time, and finally deleting the message to prevent redelivery.
If you're interested in simplifying your message queue implementation in Go using SQLite, check out goqite on GitHub for more details and examples.

The discussion on Hacker News about the new persistent message queue Go library goqite involved various aspects. Users discussed the library's performance, implementation, similarities to other tools, and practical applications. Some users compared goqite with other tools like SQLite, Python, and LevelDB, highlighting differences and potential optimizations. There were also discussions on SQLite, database schema management, and transaction handling in the context of the new library. Users shared insights, tips, and suggestions for potential improvements in the library, while also engaging in naming suggestions and feedback on project management practices. Overall, the discussion provided a deep dive into the technical aspects and broader implications of using goqite for message queue implementations in Go.
