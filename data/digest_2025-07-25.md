#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/07/experimental-surgery-performed-by-ai-driven-surgical-robot/) | 111 points | by [horseradish](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=horseradish) | [120 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44688096)

In a groundbreaking leap for robotics and healthcare, researchers at Johns Hopkins University have made a remarkable advance by integrating an AI system into the DaVinci surgical robot to successfully perform a gallbladder removal surgery. This new AI—the Surgical Robot Transformer (SRT-H)—employs a dual transformer model architecture similar to that which powers ChatGPT. This cutting-edge technology serves as a testament to the potential of AI in performing complex medical procedures with precision.

Traditionally, robotic surgeries relied heavily on pre-programmed sequences, much like how industrial robots on assembly lines operate. However, Axel Krieger and his team took a significant step forward by developing a system that learns from human demonstrations. The team trained SRT-H using imitation learning, from which the robot achieved a 100% success rate in performing cholecystectomy on test samples it had never encountered before.

What makes SRT-H stand out is its ability to receive real-time feedback in natural language and adapt its performance accordingly. This makes the system similar to a human apprentice, as it assimilates expert advice to fine-tune its surgical actions.

However, the journey for AI surgical robots is not without obstacles. The lack of necessary kinematics data from the industry-standard DaVinci robots is proving to be a bottleneck. Although Intuitive Surgical, the maker of DaVinci, is willing to share video feeds, it restricts kinematics data sharing to protect its competitive edge, posing a challenge for researchers. Yet, Kim and his team are optimistic; they're considering innovative workarounds such as motion-tracking sensors on manual surgical tools to capture the needed data.

In summary, this introduction of a ChatGPT-inspired AI into surgical robots isn't just a step—it could be a leap—towards the future of autonomous surgery. While some corporate barriers remain, researchers are determined to overcome them, inching closer to a future where AI and humans collaborate seamlessly in operating theaters worldwide.

### The Mythical Machine-Month Paradox – How much could AI change programming?

#### [Submission URL](https://tucson-josh.com/posts/mythical-machine-month/) | 26 points | by [tucson-josh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tucson-josh) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44685627)

The software industry is currently grappling with a transformative shift driven by the rise of generative AI, which threatens to redefine how code is produced and the roles of software engineers. As generative AI advances, some corporate leaders predict that AI could be responsible for crafting 95% of code by decade's end. This prospect dangles the possibility of streamlined operations, potentially enabling companies to develop software faster and at reduced costs, even postulating the emergence of unicorn SaaS companies driven by a single employee leveraging AI technologies.

However, the transition isn't as seamless as it seems. At the heart of any valuable software lies a complex theoretical model—an intricate blueprint that accurately solves a problem and accounts for edge cases, user interactions, and integrations with other systems. The process of translating this model into code is deemed straightforward but is interwoven with iteration, testing, and refinement. It requires a nuanced understanding that generative AI, with its prose-based interface, might struggle to replicate without deeper comprehension and problem-solving prowess.

Thus, while AI can assist in creating large volumes of code, the challenge remains for it to understand and extrapolate the sophisticated theoretical models driving software. The process of determining these models traditionally involves iterative development—testing and refining ideas—which AI must also navigate to fulfill its promise of surpassing human developers in productivity.

Moreover, the true test of software lies in its deployment, where real-world usage uncovers imperfections in models or code implementations. Testing, an essential part of the development lifecycle, ranges from individual unit validation to complex system performance assessments, uncovering issues not envisaged during initial designing. With AI, the questions arise about how it will handle such complexities and whether it can adapt as software intricacies evolve.

In essence, while generative AI heralds a potential paradigm shift in software development, the journey from human-written to AI-driven code involves bridging significant theoretical and practical complexities. The future may indeed hold a larger AI footprint in coding, but software engineers will likely continue to play a crucial role in crafting, maintaining, and improving the systemic integrity of the theoretical models that power our digital world.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Debugging AI-Generated Code & Kernighan's Law:**  
   Participants reference Kernighan’s Law (“Debugging is twice as hard as writing code”) to highlight concerns around AI-generated code’s complexity. Clever, opaque code from AI (e.g., via LLMs) complicates debugging. Tools like Claude are noted for debugging attempts, but challenges persist in navigating probabilistic outputs and embracing iterative refinement over perfect inputs.

2. **Classic Software Principles in the AI Era:**  
   Comparisons to *The Mythical Man-Month* and Brooks’ “No Silver Bullet” essay surface skepticism about AI as a panacea. Comments humorously adapt “mythical machine-minute” to critique overhyped promises of AI-driven productivity gains, stressing that adding AI may not bypass traditional project complexities.

3. **AI’s Transformative Impact:**  
   A tangential analogy likens generative AI’s disruption to the Chicxulub asteroid impact, underscoring its transformative potential while hinting at hype.  

4. **Behind-the-Scenes Tech Shifts:**  
   Speculation arises about unspoken changes in large tech companies’ systems (e.g., replacing databases with AI-driven interfaces like chatbots), questioning transparency and practical implementation.

**Key Themes:**  
- AI’s role amplifies existing software challenges (debugging, complexity) rather than eliminating them.  
- Classic engineering wisdom remains relevant in tempering AI optimism.  
- Underlying systemic shifts in tech infrastructure may be underacknowledged.

- **Use Cases**: Praised for tackling complex tasks (e.g., analytical integrals), though occasional repetition in outputs was noted with low-bit quantization.  

**Censorship & Ethics**  
- Users flagged potential censorship, as the model (backed by Alibaba) avoided sensitive historical topics like Tiananmen Square, aligning with Chinese regulatory norms. Skepticism arose about its reliability for politically charged queries.  

**Community Sentiment**  
- **Mixed Reactions**: Some lauded Qwen3’s technical advancements, while others doubted benchmark validity and emphasized real-world performance over parameter counts (235B parameters, 22B active).  
- **Open-Source Concerns**: Discussions highlighted challenges in running such large models locally, with calls for smaller, efficient variants (e.g., Gemma) over brute-force scaling.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects enthusiasm for Qwen3’s innovations but underscores skepticism around benchmarks, censorship, and practical deployment hurdles. Technical depth, licensing, and ethical implications remain focal points for developers and researchers.
