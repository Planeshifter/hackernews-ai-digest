#### [Submission URL](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/) | 226 points | by [brianyu8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianyu8) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872438)

In a recent blog post, the author delves into the topic of approximate deduplication using Jaccard similarity and the MinHash approximation technique. The post explores the concept of defining similarity between documents and the challenges of approximate deduplication at scale.

The Jaccard index, a measure widely used in text processing, compares sets by calculating the ratio of their overlap to the size of their union. The author explains how this index intuitively captures the similarity between sets based on their elements.

To scale up the process of finding approximate duplicates, the post discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing techniques for Jaccard similarity. By creating MinHash signatures for documents, which are small, fixed-size representations of the original sets, similar documents can be grouped efficiently.

By employing random sampling techniques and permutations, MinHash signatures offer a way to estimate Jaccard similarity between documents without examining the entire sets. This approach provides a practical method for identifying approximate duplicates within a large collection of documents.

### Diffusion Forcing: Next-Token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion

#### [Submission URL](https://boyuan.space/diffusion-forcing/) | 206 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40871783)

The paper "Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion" introduces a novel training paradigm that combines the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models and next-token prediction models. By training a diffusion model to denoise tokens with varying noise levels, this approach, called Diffusion Forcing, allows for flexible and compositional generation while offering sequence-level guidance.

Diffusion Forcing can stabilize auto-regressive rollout, guide over long horizons, and support planning with causal uncertainty by utilizing different noise levels across a sequence during sampling. The method showcases stable and consistent video prediction results in datasets like DMLab and Minecraft, outperforming traditional teacher forcing and causal full-sequence diffusion models.

Moreover, Diffusion Forcing enables the generation of long videos beyond the training horizon without the need for a sliding window approach, demonstrating its stabilization effect. It also extends to diffusion planning, offering a decision-making framework with causal relationships and the ability to model long-horizon tasks like real robot arm manipulations.

Overall, Diffusion Forcing presents a versatile approach that optimizes a variational lower bound on token likelihoods, leading to marked performance gains in decision-making, planning tasks, and video prediction applications.

### AI washing: Silicon Valley's big new lie

#### [Submission URL](https://www.computerworld.com/article/2511301/ai-washing-silicon-valleys-big-new-lie.html) | 32 points | by [sharpshadow](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sharpshadow) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40876638)

Today's top story on Hacker News delves into the concept of AI washing, a misleading marketing practice that exaggerates the role of artificial intelligence in products or services being promoted. The piece by Mike Elgan sheds light on how companies often overstate the capabilities of AI, presenting a facade of autonomous systems while relying heavily on human intervention behind the scenes.

The article highlights examples like Amazon's high-tech stores and self-driving cars, revealing that despite the AI hype, there are significant human efforts involved in making these technologies function effectively. For instance, Amazon's cashier-less stores required around 1,000 human employees to ensure smooth operations, despite the initial impression of a completely automated checkout experience.

The piece also touches on the reasons behind AI washing, attributing it to the belief among tech leaders that AI can solve complex problems autonomously. However, the reality often falls short of these lofty claims, leading companies to downplay the human involvement necessary to support and operate their AI-driven solutions.

In a tech landscape where AI promises are abundant, this insightful commentary serves as a reminder to look beyond the AI hype and understand the nuanced interplay between artificial intelligence and human intervention in modern tech innovations.

- **ddgrd** comments on the notion of experts in VR, blockchain, and AI, suggesting that simply mentioning these terms doesn't make someone an expert, and that true expertise requires more than just superficial knowledge.

- **joe_the_user** reflects on the complexity of AI and its limitations in directly transforming things, pointing out the tendency in the industry to focus more on generating content rather than improving the quality of existing content.

- **chrsjj** criticizes Amazon for labeling its technology as AI in a deceptive manner, with a discussion ensuing about the actual application of AI in Amazon's stores and the involvement of human employees despite the AI facade. There's also a mention of Amazon's staff in India remotely managing cameras in stores and rejecting the notion of fully autonomous operations.

- **superb_dev** and **chrsjj** delve into the discussion of Amazon's AI washing practices, highlighting that the sales pitch doesn't match the reality of human involvement in the technology.

- **lfw** comments on the significant human workforce required in Amazon's stores, particularly in India, and questions the true level of automation versus human intervention in the operation of these stores.

Overall, the discussion touches upon the misrepresentation of AI in marketing, the importance of genuine expertise in technology, and the realities of human involvement behind the scenes of seemingly autonomous systems.
