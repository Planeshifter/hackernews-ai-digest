### The Coprophagic AI Crisis

#### [Submission URL](https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/14/inhuman-centipede/) | 40 points | by [MrVandemar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MrVandemar) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39722283)

In the latest Hacker News story, science fiction writer Charlie Stross discusses the dangers of blurring the lines between science fiction and reality in the context of AI development. He highlights the misconception that simply adding more computational power will lead to conscious AI, likening it to a well-worn trope in science fiction.

Stross warns against the belief that increasing the AI's complexity through more data will automatically fix its flaws, pointing out the proliferation of inaccurate or fabricated content generated by AI, aptly termed "botshit." This flood of low-quality content poses a significant problem as it overwhelms and diminishes the quality of human-created content on the internet.

Furthermore, the narrative analogizes the AI's consumption of its own generated data to a form of coprophagy, where feeding on its own output leads to irreversible defects in models. This highlights the potential pitfalls of training AI on contaminated or low-quality data, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high standards in AI development.

Overall, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of relying solely on increased computational power and data to drive AI progress, urging for a more thoughtful and discerning approach to AI development.

The discussion following the submission on Hacker News covers various perspectives on the challenges and misconceptions surrounding AI development:

1. **rnx** mentions two major problems in the context of AI development: the somewhat conflicting emphasis on more power versus more managed training data. They argue that there is not particularly strong evidence that training data is the key factor in AI advancements, citing examples like AlphaGo where insufficient training data seems to have been effective. They also mention the transformative improvements in performance that AI has achieved without replicating human cognitive skills, challenging the notion that AI needs to mimic human capabilities to be effective.

2. **rkktmnsch** responds by criticizing the vague and confusing arguments made by the average person regarding AI performance, suggesting that many statements lack a logical basis and lead nowhere. They also tangentially bring up the concept of AI-driven self-landing ballistic rockets, highlighting the importance of a step-by-step approach to defining requirements and parameters in such a complex system.

3. **bmbzld** agrees with the discussion, pointing out the recent rise of postmodernism in art and suggesting a deconstructive rather than constructive approach may be more beneficial for AI development. They imply that a more spiritual approach may lead AI research in a better direction.

4. **tvrt** introduces a cyberpunk warning and suggestion, alluding to the potential dangers of AI in generating low-quality content like "botshit." They mention using AI for profit-driven purposes without regard for ethical considerations, highlighting the need for caution in how AI technologies are utilized.

Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of viewpoints on the current state and future directions of AI development, with considerations ranging from the technical challenges of training data to broader philosophical implications and ethical concerns surrounding AI technologies.
