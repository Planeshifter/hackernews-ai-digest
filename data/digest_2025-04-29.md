**Conclusion**:  
The community views CoRT’s recursive verification as a promising step toward enhanced AI reasoning but emphasizes the need for hybrid approaches (human + automated checks), task-specific adaptations, and cost-effective scalability. Practical experimentation, iterative workflows, and leveraging external validators are highlighted as effective strategies.

### An illustrated guide to automatic sparse differentiation

#### [Submission URL](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2025/blog/sparse-autodiff/) | 121 points | by [mariuz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mariuz) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43828423)

In the bustling world of machine learning, we're all familiar with automatic differentiation, a method that swiftly calculates gradients essential for model optimization. But dive deeper, and you'll discover the lesser-known sibling: automatic sparse differentiation (ASD). This specialized process capitalizes on the sparseness of Hessians and Jacobians—those large, unwieldy matrices where most elements are zero—common in scientific and engineering applications. By focusing only on the non-zero elements, ASD can dramatically speed up computations and cut down on memory usage.

Our illustrated guide starts with the basics: understanding traditional automatic differentiation (AD) and its role in computing Jacobians using both forward and reverse modes. From there, we explore the heart of ASD, which hinges on two core techniques: detecting sparsity patterns and employing matrix coloring. These strategies enable the efficient calculation of sparse Jacobians, and subsequently, sparse Hessians.

For those entrenched in machine learning, the benefits are clear. While first-order optimization via gradients is standard, utilizing sparse structures can significantly enhance the performance of second-order methods, which deal with these large matrices. However, ASD remains underutilized, partly because its theoretical foundations were developed outside the mainstream machine learning discourse. This post aims to bridge that gap, showcasing how ASD can revolutionize computational efficiency in real-world applications.

Through a practical demonstration within the post, readers can see firsthand how ASD shines when handling high-dimensional data, providing benchmarks and scenarios where it surpasses traditional methods. By demystifying ASD’s approach to leveraging sparsity, this guide opens the door to faster, more memory-conscious machine learning optimizations, paving the way for broader adoption in cutting-edge applications.

   - **Performance**: Bamba is cited as twice as fast as equivalent transformers, with comparisons to Mamba2 and discussions on inference speed improvements via vLLM optimizations.  

2. **Cultural Humor**:  
   - The name "Bamba" sparked jokes about it being a popular Israeli peanut-flavored snack, linked to Trader Joe’s and peanut allergy studies. Others referenced the song *La Bamba* and multilingual interpretations ("flimsy" in Portuguese).  

3. **Architecture Debates**:  
   - SSMs vs. Transformers: Some argued SSMs, as modern RNNs, struggle with contextual retention compared to transformers’ attention mechanisms. Others likened this to human short-term memory limitations, questioning if models should mimic such constraints.  

4. **Resource Sharing**:  
   - Users requested code access; links to Hugging Face and GitHub repositories were shared.  

5. **Critical and Philosophical Takes**:  
   - Skepticism emerged around testing methodologies (e.g., GPQA scores) and claims of context length. Discussions contrasted human cognition (e.g., re-reading, memory ) with model architectures, pondering AI’s alignment with human learning.  

6. **Lighthearted Jokes**:  
   - Tangents included mock praise for IBM’s "flmsy" Portuguese translation, SSM acronym jokes ("Structured State-Space Models"), and snack-inspired enthusiasm.  

In summary, the thread balanced technical depth with community humor, reflecting enthusiasm for Bamba’s potential and the HN community’s signature blend of rigor and levity.

### Generative AI is not replacing jobs or hurting wages at all, say economists

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/generative_ai_no_effect_jobs_wages/) | 331 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [478 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43830613)

In a fascinating twist on the tech narrative, a recent paper by economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard suggests that generative AI, despite being the tech industry's darling with billions in investment, hasn't quite delivered the economic revolution some predicted. Their study examined the impact of AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, across 11 job categories in Denmark, from educators to software developers, and found no significant wage or labor effects. 

This revelation complicates the tech industry's hype about AI's economic potential and raises questions about the massive capital poured into AI infrastructure. The economists' research indicated that while chatbot adoption is high, the economic benefits are minimal, with time savings clocking in at a mere 2.8% of work hours, tantamount to just over an hour per typical workweek. 

Interestingly, the speedy adoption of AI chatbots has not translated into drastic changes or benefits. Instead, it's reshaping jobs by creating new tasks, including those monitoring whether AI tools, like ChatGPT, are used for cheating—tasks that ironically eat into potential time savings. Humlum points out that while these new activities could, in a best-case scenario, lead to higher-value tasks and possibly wages, the overall productivity gains remain limited. 

Moreover, only a sliver of any productivity boost reaches workers' pockets, with just 3-7% seen in higher earnings. While AI might save time on activities like emailing, it doesn't necessarily mean employees can take on more work to increase earnings. This insight frames a backdrop where firms might reap more benefits than workers, casting a nuanced light on the AI advancement narrative and hinting at a future where the real economic game-changer status of AI is still on the horizon.

The discussion surrounding the study on generative AI's economic impact reflects widespread skepticism and nuanced debates. Key points include:

1. **Minimal Measurable Impact**: Users highlight the study’s finding of only **2.8% time savings** (≈1 hour/week) from AI tools, questioning whether such marginal gains justify the hype or investment. Critics argue these savings often fail to translate into wage increases, as companies absorb efficiency gains without redistributing benefits to workers.  

2. **Productivity vs. Wages**: A recurring theme is the disconnect between AI-driven productivity and wage growth. While AI might streamline tasks (e.g., drafting emails), participants note that saved time often leads to **new administrative burdens** (e.g., monitoring AI use) or increased workload demands rather than higher pay. Some argue companies prioritize revenue growth over employee compensation.

3. **Historical Analogues**: Commenters draw parallels to past technological shifts, like textile automation, which reshaped jobs without reducing employment long-term. Others cite **Jevons Paradox**—efficiency gains (e.g., cheaper software) may spur demand for new services, creating unforeseen roles while rendering others obsolete.

4. **Technical Realities**: Developers debate AI’s practical utility in technical fields (e.g., coding, UI design). While some praise tools like ChatGPT for accelerating tasks (e.g., generating code drafts), others note limitations, emphasizing that **baseline expertise** remains critical. Efficiency gains here are often incremental (e.g., saving 5% of time) rather than transformative.

5. **Economic Structures**: Discussions critique systemic factors, such as corporate greed, regulatory capture in education, and rising student debt, which may distort AI’s potential benefits. Critics argue markets increasingly favor price-fixing over competition, dampening consumer gains from AI-driven cost reductions.

6. **Skepticism of Hype**: Many dismiss the AI “revolution” narrative as market-driven speculation, stressing that real-world adoption often falls short of transformative claims. The study’s focus on Denmark is seen as a caution against overgeneralizing AI’s global impact.

In essence, the consensus leans toward **cautious doubt**: while AI introduces incremental efficiencies, structural economic forces and historical precedents suggest its revolutionary potential remains unrealized, with benefits disproportionately favoring firms over workers.

### A single line of code cost $8000

#### [Submission URL](https://pietrasiak.com/one-line-of-code-that-did-cost-dollar8000) | 297 points | by [lordfuckleroy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lordfuckleroy) | [403 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43829006)

Today's top story on Hacker News revolves around a costly software oversight that left the developers of the Screen Studio app with an $8,000 bill and a lot of lessons learned. The chilling tale begins with a refactoring mishap in the app’s auto-updater, causing it to repeatedly download a 250MB update file every five minutes for each user. This seemingly insignificant error led to 9 million unnecessary downloads—over 2 petabytes of traffic on Google Cloud.

The bug persisted unnoticed for more than a month, as many users ran the app in the background without realizing the massive data consumption occurring. With a staggering traffic range between 100Mib/s and 1GiB/s second-by-second, it's no wonder the issue snowballed into a financial nightmare.

A series of oversights compounded the problem: no cost alerts on Google Cloud, reliance on the app's prior seamless performance, and failure to monitor backend operations regularly. The financial impact was severe, but some end users faced even greater consequences, like having their internet service disrupted due to the anomalous traffic.

To remedy this, the developers pledged to account for all associated costs, though fortunately, users managed to resolve their issues independently. This incident stands as a stark reminder of best practices in software development—like setting up cloud cost alerts and meticulously crafting code—to prevent such high-stakes errors in the future.

The discussion around the Screen Studio app's costly mishap on Hacker News focused on several key themes:

### 1. **Critique of Development Practices**  
Commenters attributed the issue to bloated dependencies and poor engineering choices, particularly criticizing the use of **Electron**, which contributed to the app's large size (250MB+). Users pointed out unnecessary inclusions like **pandas/numpy** in simple apps, with one noting that "dependency resolution by default frequently imports entire packages for a single method." This "snowball effect" of dependencies was seen as a recurring industry problem. Some argued for lighter frameworks like **Tauri** instead of Electron, though others defended Electron's cross-platform utility. The app's breakdown (517MB unpacked) highlighted bundled tools like ffmpeg and multiple renderers, further illustrating bloat.

### 2. **Cost Management and Monitoring Failures**  
While the $8,000 bill for 2 petabytes of traffic was deemed "relatively cheap" by some, many emphasized the absence of Google Cloud cost alerts and backend monitoring. One user remarked, "Not setting up alerts was the *real* lesson," while others noted that ISPs might have charged users disproportionately for the excess data, with some customers losing internet access entirely.

### 3. **Update Frequency and Inefficient Caching**  
The 5-minute update checks (288x/day) were criticized as excessive. Suggestions included implementing caching, non-blocking I/O threads, or extending check intervals. A user argued, "If they’re shipping a 250MB app, they should have a brigade of servers"—implying poor scaling foresight.

### 4. **Cross-Platform Framework Debates**  
Alternatives to Electron, such as **Tauri** or even PWAs (Progressive Web Apps), were proposed to reduce app size and complexity. However, debates arose about trade-offs: Tauri was praised as lightweight but requires platform-specific tweaks for rendering, while PWAs were seen as under-supported by major platforms despite recent improvements.

### 5. **User Impact and Responsibility**  
Developers faced backlash for assuming "customers have infinite cheap bandwidth," with critics calling it irresponsible given real-world ISP data caps. Stories of users being booted from mobile hotspots underscored the human cost beyond the $8K bill.  

In hindsight, commenters stressed rigorous testing, dependency audits, and infrastructure monitoring as non-negotiables—while acknowledging that such mishaps are cautionary tales for all DevOps teams.
