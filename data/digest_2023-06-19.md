### AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/) | 277 points | by [ssn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ssn) | [203 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394569)

AI is introducing the third user-interface paradigm in computing history, shifting to a new interaction mechanism where users tell the computer what they want, not how to do it â€” thus reversing the locus of control. The newest paradigm, called intent-based outcome specification, is the first new interaction model in more than 60 years and is poised to replace graphical user interfaces as the dominant UX model. With the advent of conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT, the locus of control is shifted to the user rather than the computer, allowing for more natural and intuitive interaction. Some users argue that AI is limited in low-risk applications, while others object to the use of the term "hallucination" to describe AI errors. The conversation ultimately turns to the limitations of humans and how civilization has evolved to reduce variability and protect against unpredictable threats.

### Camera Restricta (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://philippschmitt.com/archive/2018/work/camera-restricta.html) | 25 points | by [admp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=admp) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394544)

Camera Restricta is a potential new kind of camera that uses GPS to locate itself and searches online for photos that have been geotagged nearby, to prevent the user from contributing to the overflow of generic digital imagery. It blocks the viewfinder if it decides that too many photos have been taken at that location and could be funded or subsidised by public or private sector institutions to regulate photography in certain places. While it could be controversial and be seen as a tool for censorship, it could be used to create unique and special photos of a place and limit the number of photos taken in a given location. The camera features a retractable shutter, antenna, speaker, and a smartphone that handles GPS and data connection, generating sounds and acting as the camera screen. The project is not only a political statement about censorship but also questions our photographic practice and introduces new limitations to prevent an overflow of digital imagery.

In the discussion, some users approve of the idea, stating that it could prevent an overflow of generic digital imagery and promote creativity, while others criticize it, calling it a tool for censorship. Some users suggest that limiting the number of photos taken in a location could lead to unique and special photos, while others argue that good photography relies on composition and lighting rather than location. There is also some discussion about the camera's technical features and its potential use in various settings. Overall, the discussion is a mix of support and skepticism towards the concept of Camera Restricta.

### Voicebox: Generative AI model for speech that generalizes across tasks

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/voicebox-generative-ai-model-speech/) | 211 points | by [OkGoDoIt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=OkGoDoIt) | [117 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36393262)

Meta AI researchers have unveiled their latest breakthrough in generative AI with the introduction of Voicebox. It is the first model that can generalize to speech-generation tasks it was not specifically trained to accomplish with state-of-the-art performance. Unlike its predecessors, Voicebox can modify any part of a given sample, not just the end of an audio clip it is given. It can synthesize speech across six languages, perform noise removal, content editing, style conversion, and diverse sample generation. Despite the enormous potential of generative speech models, the Voicebox model and code are not being made publicly available at this time due to concerns over potential misuse.

The discussion on this submission revolves around different topics such as digital IDs, various accents, narrating videos, training datasets, and machine translation. The discussion about digital IDs seems to emphasize the need for a responsible approach, whereas the discussion surrounding accents considers the model's ability to generate non-native accents and regional variations. Another discussion highlights the importance of context in language translation.

### Show HN: Python package for interfacing with ChatGPT with minimized complexity

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/minimaxir/simpleaichat) | 120 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36393782)

Simpleaichat is a Python package that allows for easy interfacing with chat apps like ChatGPT and GPT-4 with minimal code complexity and a range of features. With simpleaichat, users can create and run chats with just a few lines of code, and the tool is optimized to minimize the number of tokens used, reducing costs and latency. Other features include the ability to run multiple independent chats simultaneously, minimal codebase, chat streaming responses, async support, and the ability to create more complex workflows if needed. Simpleaichat is easy to install from PyPI and comes with some fun examples on how it works.

The submissions discuss tools to control attributes for GPT and a schm package for JSON schema optimization. There is praise for simpleaichat and interest in investing, but concerns over large codebases and server errors. There is a suggestion to include README files to handle server errors and comments and links to several resources like Python GPT-1, LangChain, and ChatGPT UI. A user suggests Rust and JavaScript/Typescript alternatives to LangChain, and there is talk about the usefulness of GitHub Copilot and the implementation of function logic for GPT. There is a lot of discussion about ChatGPT and the handling of server errors.

### MusicGen-Looper: Generate fixed-bpm loops from text prompts

#### [Submission URL](https://replicate.com/andreasjansson/musicgen-looper) | 115 points | by [fagerhult](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fagerhult) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36388919)

Music lovers and developers can now generate fixed-BPM music loops from text prompts thanks to the MusicGen-Looper AI model. Using this unique tool, you can input text prompts with the desired BPM, and the model generates a piece of music that BeatNet detects to extract an even number of bars. Variations are created by using MusicGen's continuation feature, and all variations are time-stretched to match the requested tempo exactly. However, there are some failure cases, such as BeatNet struggling to pick the right downbeat, and MusicGen not being able to generate vocals.

In the comments, various users suggest different text prompts, with one user asking the model to generate 60 BPM wedding procession entrance music and another requesting music with a 140 BPM breakbeat. There is also a discussion about the technical details of the model, with some users sharing links to relevant research papers and others questioning the accuracy of the generated music.
