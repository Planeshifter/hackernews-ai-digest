In 1986, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory celebrated the completion of the "Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B" (MFTF-B) with a dedication ceremony attended by 300 individuals. However, just as the project was finalized after a decade of development and almost a billion dollars in funding, it was shut down on the same day without ever being turned on. The reasons behind this decision were rooted in budget pressures, with then-Secretary of Energy John Herrington expressing regret in a letter to program director T. Kenneth Fowler.

The MFTF-B project featured impressive components, such as a 400-ton "yin-yang" magnet that was the largest superconducting magnet in the world at the time. This magnet, capable of generating magnetic fields 150,000 times that of Earth's, was designed to contain the high-temperature plasma required for fusion energy research. Despite the shutdown, the quest for fusion energy continued, with scientists at the National Ignition Facility achieving a significant milestone in 2022 by recording a fusion reaction with a net energy gain.

The 1970s energy crisis spurred interest in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, leading to substantial investments in fusion research. Two main approaches emerged from this period: the torus-shaped "tokamak" design and the magnetic mirror approach exemplified by the MFTF-B. While the tokamak design was more widely adopted, the MFTF-B represented a different path in the pursuit of fusion energy.

The decision to pursue the MFTF-B at such a large scale was met with debate and uncertainty, with factors like ideology and strategic considerations playing a role. Despite the disappointment of having the project mothballed immediately after completion, the researchers were left grappling with the abrupt end of their ambitious endeavor.

The paper "The Matrix: A Bayesian learning model for LLMs" introduces a Bayesian learning model to analyze the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). The authors, Siddhartha Dalal and Vishal Misra, delve into the optimization metric of LLMs, focusing on predicting the next token. They create a generative text model represented by a multinomial transition probability matrix with a prior, exploring how LLMs approximate this matrix. The study discusses the alignment of text generation by LLMs with Bayesian learning principles, highlighting the emergence of in-context learning in larger models. The research provides valuable insights into LLM functioning and potential applications in the field of Machine Learning.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the Bayesian learning model introduced in the paper regarding Large Language Models (LLMs). Some users express their views on the practical implementation and scalability of these models, highlighting concerns about vast parameter space requirements for Bayesian models like GPT-3. Others point out the complexities involved in comparing the optimization metric of LLMs with Bayesian learning principles, referencing historical developments in the field of machine learning. Some comments touch on the decentralized nature of the article and the transformational impact LLMs have had on transformers. Additionally, there are discussions around the paper's content and presentation, with some diverging opinions on its depth and implications. Lastly, there is a reference to a flagged comment, urging for more constructive engagement and discouraging inflammatory remarks.

### Electric 10000 ton container ship has begun service with over 50MWh in batteries

#### [Submission URL](https://electrek.co/2024/05/02/fully-electric-10000-ton-container-ship-begun-service50000-kwh-batteries/) | 19 points | by [thelastgallon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thelastgallon) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40253973)

The Chinese state-owned company COSCO Shipping has made waves by launching the world's largest river-to-sea electric container ship, the Green Water 01. This fully electric vessel marks a significant advancement in the marine logistics industry's sustainability efforts. Equipped with over 50,000 kWh in batteries, the Green Water 01 boasts impressive stats, including its length, width, container capacity, deadweight tonnage, and battery capacity. This eco-friendly ship is powered by a large-capacity battery that can be adjusted for longer voyages, making it a game-changer in reducing carbon emissions in maritime shipping. The successful launch of the Green Water 01 signifies a huge leap towards a greener future, with the ship already in service between Shanghai and Nanjing.

The comments on the submission about the launch of the world's largest river-to-sea electric container ship, the Green Water 01, delved into various aspects of electric shipping and its implications:

1. **lostemptations5** pointed out that large container ships are constantly upgraded to accommodate larger capacities and navigate rivers, canals, and oceans effectively. They emphasized the need for designs that consider all types of water bodies.
  
2. **RetroTechie** mentioned that even at a 100 containers per hundred miles range, the electric giants with capacities of over 10k containers could not serve all routes efficiently due to the presence of smaller ships covering shorter routes, thus potentially creating a niche market for electric shipping.

3. **dt** brought up a discussion related to Nimitz-class nuclear-powered aircraft carriers and provided a link to a comprehensive report from MIT, sparking a conversation about nuclear engineering and spacecraft engineering.
