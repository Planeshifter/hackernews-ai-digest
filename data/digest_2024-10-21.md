### The 3 AI Use Cases: Gods, Interns, and Cogs

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2024/Oct/20/gods-interns-and-cogs/) | 21 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41899864)

In a thought-provoking new post on Simon Willison's blog, Drew Breunig introduces a framework that classifies AI use cases into three distinct categories: **Gods**, **Interns**, and **Cogs**. 

- **Gods** represent the highly autonomous systems that could potentially replace human roles, a realm still largely viewed as science fiction. 
- **Interns**, on the other hand, function as supervised assistants that augment human capabilities—this is where many users currently find value, utilizing AI for tasks like programming with oversight. 
- **Cogs** are reliable tools that can be integrated into workflows, performing specific tasks like transcription or data extraction without constant human scrutiny.

Breunig notes a subcategory within Interns called **Toys**, which encompasses playful, user-friendly applications that prioritize enjoyment over precision, catering to non-experts with a lenient error tolerance.

This classification invites a deeper discussion on how we approach and implement AI technologies in various contexts, shedding light on their evolving roles in our daily activities and workflows.

In the discussion about Drew Breunig's classification framework for AI use cases, users expressed varied thoughts and critiques. One commenter highlighted the importance of direct communication for clarity, while another, localghost3000, suggested that a significant proportion of current large language models (LLMs) may only provide surface-level utility, referring to them as tools for basic tasks rather than true AI capabilities. This comment emphasizes the need for discernment in understanding the effectiveness and applicability of AI technologies in real-world scenarios. The conversation reflects a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism regarding the classification of AI use cases and their practical implications.

### Red Hat Reveals Major Enhancements to Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.zdnet.com/article/red-hat-reveals-major-enhancements-to-red-hat-enterprise-linux-ai/) | 15 points | by [CrankyBear](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CrankyBear) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41906572)

Red Hat has swiftly rolled out the next version of its Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI platform, RHEL AI 1.2, just weeks after releasing version 1.0. This upgrade enhances the development, testing, and deployment of large language models (LLMs), aiming to make AI more accessible and cost-effective for users beyond just data scientists. 

Key improvements include expanded hardware support for Lenovo servers and AMD GPUs, as well as availability on major cloud platforms like Azure and Google Cloud. The introduction of "Periodic Checkpointing" allows users to save their training sessions at regular intervals, facilitating quicker resumption of long runs without starting from scratch. RHEL AI 1.2 also incorporates **PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP)** technology, significantly reducing training times by splitting model parameters across parallel processing units.

This rapid rollout reflects Red Hat's commitment to being a major player in the enterprise AI landscape, allowing domain experts to contribute to AI models and ensuring easier scaling through Red Hat OpenShift AI. Users currently on version 1.1 are urged to upgrade within 30 days as support for that version will be deprecated, marking another step in the fast-evolving world of AI development.

In a discussion on Hacker News, a user expressed skepticism about IBM's AI future, suggesting that IBM is taking different approaches to provide a complete solution with self-hosted options. They mentioned that IBM is working towards making AI models more accessible through IBM Red Hat, utilizing platforms like RHEL AI and OpenShift. Another user referenced IBM's historical AI efforts, specifically its Watson initiative, indicating that while IBM has strong marketing and research skills, it currently lacks significant impact in the AI market compared to competitors like OpenAI and Anthropic.
