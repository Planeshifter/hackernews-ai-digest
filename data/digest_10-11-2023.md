#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-deep-link-equating-math-proofs-and-computer-programs-20231011/) | 238 points | by [digital55](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=digital55) | [142 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37845195)

The Curry-Howard correspondence, also known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism, is a profound revelation that links mathematical proofs and computer programs. It posits that concepts from computer science (types and programs) are equivalent to propositions and proofs from logic. This means that writing a program is not just "coding," but an act of proving a theorem. The correspondence was independently discovered by Haskell Curry and William Alvin Howard in the 1930s and 1960s, respectively. They noticed the similarity between functions in mathematics and the implication relationship in logic. When a computer program runs, each line is evaluated to yield a single output, much like simplifying a logical proof. This correspondence formalizes programming and allows for mathematical reasoning about the correctness of programs.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to formal verification, programming languages, and the Curry-Howard correspondence.

- Some users recommend studying formal methods and formal verification languages to gain a deeper understanding of proof-based programming. They suggest resources such as Coq, Isabelle, and Software Foundations.
- Others express the difficulty in understanding formal methods and suggest that it is a challenging field that requires a strong mathematical background.
- One user shares a link to a book on Programming Language Types by Benjamin Pierce.
- There is a discussion about dependent types and Homotopy Type Theory, with some users recommending Idris and Agda as programming languages that implement these concepts effectively.
- A user mentions Lamport's work on Computation State Machines and how it relates to the mathematics of programming.
- The importance of composability and correctness in formal programming is highlighted, with some users emphasizing the need for business stakeholders to appreciate the value of mathematical reasoning in software development.

Overall, the discussion is quite technical and focused on the intersection of mathematics and programming.

#### [Submission URL](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/10/11/avx10-128-is-a-silly-idea-and-should-be-completely-removed-from-the-specification/) | 127 points | by [picture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=picture) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37851029)

Intel has announced a new specification called AVX10, which aims to consolidate the various AVX-512 extensions into a single, easy-to-target specification. AVX10 is designed to bring together all the capabilities of AVX-512 into smaller implementations for consumer, micro-edge, and embedded devices that don't require the 32 512-bit registers used by AVX-512. The specification introduces a version modifier, denoted by ".N", which allows for incremental updates, and a reference to the vector register implementation size, denoted by "/M". The AVX10 specification mandates that all implementations have 32 registers, but the width of these registers depends on the given "/M". For example, AVX10/256 would have the same capabilities as AVX10/512, but with 256-bit wide registers. This means that existing code written for AVX-512 with 256-bit registers should be able to run fine with only a recompile. The AVX10 specification also includes features such as support for IEEE-754 half precision floating points and brain floating point 16 (BF16). Overall, AVX10 aims to simplify and consolidate the AVX-512 landscape, making it easier to target different devices with different register requirements.

The discussion on Hacker News is primarily focused on the implications and potential drawbacks of Intel's AVX10 specification. 

One commenter points out that AVX-512 indirectly causes performance issues and suggests that Intel could have informed OS writers earlier to avoid these problems. Another commenter agrees and mentions that AVX-256 has little to no performance cost.

There is also a discussion about the efficiency and benefits of AVX-512. Some believe that the larger register size of AVX-512 is not worth the increased complexity and instead prefer smaller register options. Others argue that AVX-512 can be beneficial for certain applications and that AVX-256 is not a sufficient substitute.

There are mentions of Microsoft and Intel's hardware trapping unsupported instructions, which leads to delays in instruction execution and decreases performance. Some commenters suggest that better coordination between OS schedulers and processors is needed to avoid these issues.

The discussion also touches on the challenges of implementing AVX512 in software and the importance of following the correct specifications to avoid crashes or illegal instruction errors.

There are mentions of other technologies like Intel Knights Landing and AMX, as well as the challenges and benefits of writing high-performance kernels in assembly code.

Some commenters discuss the intricacies of writing code for AVX-512 and the differences in ABI conventions between platforms. There is speculation about the difficulties in JIT generating code for different processors and how OS context switches can impact performance.

Overall, the discussion explores the various advantages, disadvantages, and implementation challenges of AVX-512 and its potential impact on different devices and software.
