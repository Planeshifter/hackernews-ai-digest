### Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata

#### [Submission URL](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn) | 359 points | by [eyvindn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eyvindn) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43286161)

Imagine a world where the mesmerizing complexity of life could be replicated—or even engineered—through precise, learned rules. Enter the realm of Cellular Automata (CA), a fascinating field that has long intrigued researchers with its potential to generate complex behaviors from simple, local interactions. Traditionally, CAs were somewhat rigid, requiring manual definition of these local rules. But what if we could enlist the power of machine learning to discover these rules automatically?

This is precisely the exciting frontier being explored by researchers from Google’s Paradigms of Intelligence Team. Drawing on the capabilities of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic Gates Networks, they present a novel, end-to-end differentiable approach that seeks to reverse-engineer complexity. Unlike traditional methodologies, this approach uses continuous learning methods to pin down the local rules needed for complex pattern emergence, all while maintaining the discrete nature CAs are known for.

The central idea revolves around making these systems more adaptive and interpretable. NCAs have already shown that it's possible to learn arbitrary patterns through gradient descent—a leap forward in the ability to grow, adapt, and self-organize computational systems beyond static rule sets. However, such models often struggle with the discrete state space typical of cellular automata, making it expensive, computationally, to manage their usually continuous states.

Enter Differentiable Logic Gates Networks, which bring the best of both worlds: the discrete decision-making process reminiscent of combinatorial logic circuits and the adaptability secured through differentiable training signals. When applied to recurrent settings intrinsic to CAs, they open the potential to train systems not only in time but across spatial dynamics as well.

So, how do these ideas hold up in practice? The project tackles the iconic Conway's Game of Life to test if a Differentiable Logic CA can indeed learn and evolve autonomously, proving initial learning capacities with straightforward scenarios first. The real test follows, as researchers attempt to train these models to develop complex, traditional-NCA-like patterns in both space and time, something unaccustomed for logic gate networks but potentially transformative.

By integrating differentiable logic with cellular automata, they edge closer to realizing self-organizing systems, paving the way toward Computronium—a speculative form of matter capable of performing any computation. This ambitious mix promises intriguing implications for the future of computing, suggesting systems that are locally operated, fully learnable, and fundamentally discrete—each component interacting seamlessly to craft complexity from simplicity.

In essence, this endeavor represents a fundamental shift in computational systems, heralding a future where intelligent grids of “cells” can autonomously adapt and organize, much like natural life itself. By wresting control from human designers and placing it into the hands of intelligent learning algorithms, the project hints at innovations that could reshape how we conceptualize computer architectures in the coming years.

### Why I find diffusion models interesting?

#### [Submission URL](https://rnikhil.com/2025/03/06/diffusion-models-eval) | 175 points | by [whoami_nr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoami_nr) | [76 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43285726)

Have you ever pondered how chatbot technologies might change if they could plan their sentences with greater accuracy and coherence? Enter diffusion models, a fresh approach to large language models (LLMs) that could revolutionize how we generate text.

Recently, Inception Labs launched their Diffusion LLM (dLLM), which changes the game by not following the traditional left-to-right token prediction method. Instead, dLLMs take a holistic view, working on generating different parts of a text simultaneously, whether it's the beginning, middle, or end.

Interestingly, this model draws inspiration from technologies used in image and video models, and it's already outperforming similarly sized LLMs, particularly in code generation. Equally impressive is the claim that dLLMs offer a 5-10x boost in speed and efficiency.

So why am I excited about this? Especially for someone who's spent years evaluating LLMs, the potential improvements are significant. Traditional models often hallucinate, creating confident but misleading outputs. In contrast, dLLMs can focus on crucial parts of a response initially, allowing for validation before progressing, which could greatly enhance reliability and reduce hallucinations.

Take, for example, a customer service chatbot. Instead of haphazardly guessing the details of a policy, a dLLM could generate the policy version first, confirm it, and only then provide guidance. This could lead to a substantial leap in the accuracy of the information provided by such agents.

This shift also promises to enhance the capabilities of automated agents. With multi-step workflows, dLLMs can bring clear foresight, ensuring plans remain consistent and free of logical pitfalls. Think of it as having the ability to glimpse a few steps ahead in a conversation, preventing the dreaded loop of errors we're accustomed to with traditional models.

Curious about how this model handles complex topics? Try prompting a dLLM with something intricate, like an explanation of game theory. You'll notice that it can construct sentences in a seemingly out-of-order way, often resolving the sentence ends before even touching the middle parts. It's a fascinating change that you can explore yourself on platforms like Hugging Face.

In summary, diffusion models could be the key to developing smarter, more coherent, and reliable LLMs, paving the way for a new era of AI communication that's less about guesswork and more about precision and clarity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Diffusion LLMs:**

The discussion revolves around the potential of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to improve text generation by addressing limitations of traditional autoregressive models. Key points include:

1. **Mechanism & Benefits:**
   - Diffusion models iteratively refine text, correcting errors across the entire sequence (analogized to a teacher revising a student’s draft multiple times). This contrasts with autoregressive models, which predict tokens sequentially without backtracking.
   - Commenters highlight potential reductions in hallucinations, as dLLMs can validate critical parts of responses early (e.g., policy details in customer service bots) before finalizing output.

2. **Technical Comparisons:**
   - Autoregressive models struggle with error accumulation and lack global coherence, while diffusion models allow bidirectional reasoning and parallel token generation. Some note parallels to image/video diffusion techniques.
   - Skeptics argue autoregressive models still dominate due to computational efficiency, though proponents counter that dLLMs decouple context window size from compute steps, enabling flexibility.

3. **Challenges & Trade-offs:**
   - Computational cost is a concern: Diffusion steps require multiple iterations, raising GPU demands. However, some suggest hybrid approaches (e.g., combining smaller models) could mitigate this.
   - Questions arise about whether dLLMs’ iterative refinement justifies the overhead compared to single-step autoregressive generation, especially for real-time applications.

4. **Implementation & Demos:**
   - Tools like **ComfyUI** and **Floneum** are mentioned as frameworks for experimenting with diffusion workflows. A demo ([LLaDA-dm](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-dm/)) showcases bidirectional reasoning capabilities.
   - Fixed token blocks in diffusion models are noted, with outputs truncated to predefined lengths, unlike autoregressive models that halt at an end token.

5. **Skepticism & Debate:**
   - Some doubt claims of reduced hallucinations, arguing statistical token prediction inherently risks incoherence regardless of architecture. Others counter that iterative correction offers a tangible path to reliability.
   - A subthread debates whether LLMs can truly “self-correct,” with opinions split on the role of global attention vs. error accumulation in long contexts.

6. **Broader Implications:**
   - The discussion touches on scaling laws, with links to research suggesting diffusion models follow predictable efficiency trends. Some speculate future systems might blend multiple paradigms (autoregressive + diffusion) for optimal results.

**Conclusion:** The community shows cautious optimism about dLLMs’ potential for coherent, reliable text generation but emphasizes unresolved challenges in compute efficiency and practical implementation. The thread reflects a mix of technical curiosity, skepticism, and excitement for experimentation.

### Cognitive Behaviors That Enable Self-Improving Reasoners

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307) | 267 points | by [delifue](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=delifue) | [99 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43275193)

An intriguing paper recently submitted to arXiv explores what cognitive behaviors make language models better self-improving reasoners. Titled "Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four Habits of Highly Effective STaRs," this research by Kanishk Gandhi and colleagues delves into how models like Qwen-2.5-3B outshine counterparts like Llama-3.2-3B in self-improving tasks. The key lies in four cognitive behaviors: verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining, which are hallmark strategies of expert problem solvers and high-achieving models.

The researchers discovered that Qwen naturally possesses these reasoning faculties, enabling it to harness reinforcement learning (RL) processes effectively, while Llama initially comes up short. However, by priming Llama with examples showcasing these cognitive strategies, it significantly boosts its RL performance, rivaling or surpassing Qwen's results—even when fed incorrect solutions framed with the right reasoning patterns. This research emphasizes that the presence of these cognitive behaviors, more than the accuracy of answers, drives a model's capacity to self-improve.

The study underscores the importance of initial reasoning qualities in language models, explaining why some models excel with computational training and others stagnate. With continued training on datasets amplifying these behaviors, the potential for self-improvement in models like Llama can be unlocked. The paper provides a novel perspective on enhancing AI capabilities through strategic cognitive behavior priming, presenting a pathway to developing more advanced, self-reasoning language models.

The discussion explores the intersection of cognitive strategies in AI and human reasoning, drawing parallels between techniques highlighted in the paper (verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, backward chaining) and human problem-solving methods like **rubber duck debugging** (explaining problems aloud to inanimate objects). Key points include:

1. **AI and Reasoning Patterns**:  
   - Models like Qwen excel in self-improvement by mimicking expert cognitive behaviors. Users note that structured reasoning methods (e.g., writing out steps, externalizing thoughts) enhance both AI and human problem-solving, even if initial steps are flawed.

2. **Rubber Ducking and Externalization**:  
   - Participants liken AI-assisted reasoning to "rubber duck debugging," where vocalizing thoughts helps clarify issues. Some humorously suggest AI-powered "rubber duck" tools, while others emphasize design documentation or whiteboarding as analogous practices.

3. **Historical and Cultural Context**:  
   - Debates arise about memory vs. understanding, referencing Socrates’ skepticism of writing, Quranic memorization (*Hafiz*), and classical texts (e.g., Homer, Beowulf). Philosophical quotes (Confucius, Lao Tzu, Rumi) warn against over-reliance on external knowledge, advocating for internal clarity.

4. **AI’s Impact on Human Cognition**:  
   - Concerns emerge that AI dependence might erode human reasoning skills, citing studies showing reduced critical thinking when over-relying on tools. Others counter that AI can augment cognition if used strategically, akin to historical aids like mnemonics or British civil service exam prep.

5. **Practical Anecdotes**:  
   - Users share personal experiences with self-talk, workplace problem-solving, and the value of breaking tasks into subtasks. One humorously recounts a girlfriend’s alarm at overhearing internal monologues during debugging.

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores the synergy between AI’s self-improvement strategies and human cognitive habits, while cautioning against complacency. It highlights the timeless tension between external tools and intrinsic understanding, urging balanced integration of AI to enhance—not replace—human reasoning.

### Automatically tagging politician when they use their phone on the livestreams

#### [Submission URL](https://driesdepoorter.be/theflemishscrollers/) | 263 points | by [driesdep](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=driesdep) | [147 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43278473)

Imagine being in a government meeting and seeing your face tagged on social media for being glued to your phone. In Belgium, this has become a reality thanks to a creative piece of AI software called the Flemish Scrollers. This innovative program scans the live YouTube streams of the Flemish government meetings and automatically calls out Belgian politicians indulging in a little screen time during sessions.

Leveraging the power of AI and facial recognition through technologies like Keras, this Python-driven tool detects distracted politicians by recognizing their faces and smartphones in real time. The software then posts videos of these moments on Twitter and Instagram, tagging the concerned politician for a public reminder of their multitasking moment.

Since its inception on July 5, 2021, the software hasn’t just kept everyone on their toes during live meetings. It also dives into older video uploads to ensure no distracted encounter goes unnoticed. The brilliance behind this AI-driven tool led to its showcase at an exhibition in Switzerland, wherein a custom server demonstrated the process and its entertaining results.

Aside from bringing a new layer of accountability to the government proceedings, the Flemish Scrollers blend tech innovation with a pinch of societal nudging, proving that sometimes, a little shame can go a long way towards staying present. 

Of course, the ingenious creator behind it has commercial motives too, encouraging support by offering some merch like the 'Shortlife' and 'Shirt', cleverly tying in the work to some product promotion. It's safe to say this intersection of politics, technology, and art has struck a chord far beyond Belgium's borders!

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Intel's DeepSeek/llama.cpp Guide:**

The discussion revolves around deploying DeepSeek models using Intel's guide with **llama.cpp** and **IPEX-LLM**, focusing on performance, quantization, hardware constraints, and practicality:

1. **Performance & Quantization Insights:**
   - Users highlight trade-offs between quantization levels (e.g., FP8 vs. Q2/K variants). Q2 models are surprisingly capable, but aggressive quantization (e.g., Q2_XXS) may introduce errors in coding tasks.
   - **DeepSeek-R1** and **v2.5** models are noted for efficiency, with v2.5 compared to **Llama 3 70B** but requiring fewer parameters (suitable for ~100GB VRAM setups). Dynamic quantization via tools like **Unsloth R1** is discussed for optimizing speed.

2. **Hardware Experiences:**
   - **Intel Xeon + NVIDIA GPUs**: A user reports mixed performance (e.g., 474 tokens/sec prompt processing vs. slower response times on CPUs) and wishes for better quantization for DeepSeek v3.
   - **Intel Arc GPUs**: While cost-effective, limitations arise in memory bandwidth (VRAM vs. DDR RAM speeds), especially for large models. Context length is constrained by VRAM, but CPU offloading enables larger models at slower speeds.
   - **Consumer Devices**: Attempts to run models on devices like the Pixel Fold (Android) face challenges, but Apple’s Metal acceleration on iPhones shows promise. Debate ensues on whether local inference is practical or a "gimmick" akin to running Crysis on CPUs.

3. **Cost & Practicality Debates:**
   - High-end setups (e.g., AMD Threadripper + multiple GPUs) are compared to Intel’s Arc GPUs, with some users favoring AMD for multi-GPU scalability despite costs (~$10k+).
   - Skepticism exists around the feasibility of local inference due to latency (e.g., 2-3 minutes for simple prompts on AMD setups), though optimizations like **llama.cpp** and GGUF formats are improving accessibility.

4. **Software & Community Progress:**
   - **llama.cpp**’s advancements (e.g., portable ZIP support for Intel GPUs) and library improvements (e.g., better model formatting and Metal backend support) are praised. Tools like **Ollama** simplify multi-GPU setups but struggle with integrated GPUs.
   - Some see local LLMs as the future, replacing cloud dependency, while others stress that current hardware limitations require patience for tasks like RAG or long-context inference.

**Key Takeaways:** The community acknowledges Intel’s efforts but debates the balance between cost, performance, and practicality. While high-end hardware delivers, optimizations in quantization and software (e.g., GGUF, llama.cpp) are critical for making local inference broadly viable, especially on consumer devices.

### LLMs Don't Know What They Don't Know–and That's a Problem

Title: **The Overconfidence Crisis of LLMs: Why Knowing Their Limits is Key**

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, Language Learning Models (LLMs) are celebrated for generating swift solutions, often with dazzling creativity. Yet, there's a looming issue beyond their occasionally factually incorrect outputs, also known as hallucinations. The core problem? LLMs don’t know what they don’t know—they lack self-awareness about their own capabilities.

### The Undiscussed Weakness: Lack of Self-Awareness

Colin Eberhardt highlights a crucial, yet underreported problem in his recent article: LLMs’ blatant overconfidence. Models like GPT4.5 may dazzle with their outputs, but they fundamentally can't gauge what they can or can't do. Unlike a human engineer who seeks clarification when faced with vague tasks, LLMs blindly forge ahead, often resulting in half-baked solutions.

### Vibe Coding: A Double-Edged Sword

Enter the concept of 'vibe coding', popularized by AI pioneer Andrej Karpathy. This idea encourages letting AI handle the grunt work while users provide prompts and directives. While this sounds promising, Simon Willison warns that the real danger lies not in the hallucinations that can be debugged by compilers, but in LLMs’ inability to recognize tasks beyond their reach.

### Case in Point: Overcompensation and Unrealized Potential

Eberhardt explores this issue through practical examples like Bolt, an LLM-based tool. When tasked with creating a word guessing game or even a complex FX trading application, Bolt valiantly attempts these challenges, often producing rudimentary outputs. Similarly, when asked to provide LEGO build instructions, the step-by-step guidance is simplistic at best, woefully inadequate compared to the complex model initially rendered by the LLM.

### Conclusion: Rethinking AI Expectations

As AI development continues, Eberhardt suggests that the key to progress is models that can understand ambiguity, seek clarification, and know when they’re out of their depth. Rather than focusing solely on achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), perhaps it’s time to demand LLMs that understand and express awareness of their limitations to enhance their utility and reliability.

Until LLMs can mirror human-like judgment in knowing their boundaries, users and developers must remain vigilant, testing and verifying AI outputs rigorously to mitigate the effects of their inherent overconfidence.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around LLMs' overconfidence and limitations highlighted several key themes, critiques, and anecdotes:

1. **Misapplication and Overreach**:  
   Users compared LLMs to using a "hammer for screws," emphasizing their tendency to generate confident but often incorrect or superficial answers when tasked with problems beyond their capabilities. Examples included coding errors in niche languages (e.g., Babbage assembly) and fabricating part numbers for hardware components.

2. **Human Parallels**:  
   Some commenters noted that humans also struggle with overconfidence, but LLMs exacerbate this issue by lacking self-awareness. One user remarked, "LLMs mirror human behavior—I’ve met people who refuse to admit they don’t know something."

3. **Benchmarks and Hallucinations**:  
   Skepticism arose around benchmarks showing high hallucination rates (e.g., OpenAI’s 40% error rate in certain tasks). Users criticized the reward structure of LLMs, which prioritizes confident answers over accuracy, leading to "bullshit outputs" that mimic coherent language without factual grounding.

4. **Niche Failures vs. General Utility**:  
   While LLMs excel at broad language tasks, they falter in specialized domains. Examples included poor performance in parsing technical queries or retrieving precise information, with one user suggesting LLMs should defer to external tools for factual accuracy.

5. **Progress and Mitigation**:  
   A few highlighted incremental improvements, such as Claude occasionally asking for clarification. However, most agreed that LLMs remain far from reliable self-assessment. Custom instructions (e.g., "admit uncertainty") were proposed as partial fixes, though their effectiveness is debated.

6. **Cultural Impact**:  
   Concerns were raised about AI-generated summaries discouraging deep reading and critical thinking. One user lamented, "People don’t read full texts anymore—LLMs feed a cycle of shallow engagement."

7. **Cynicism vs. Optimism**:  
   The discussion split between critics dismissing LLMs as "glorified autocomplete" and optimists acknowledging their potential if used cautiously. A recurring analogy framed LLMs as "jack-of-all-trades, master of none," urging developers to recognize their role as tools, not replacements for human judgment.

**Conclusion**: The consensus leaned toward cautious pragmatism—LLMs’ overconfidence is a critical flaw, but their utility persists when users rigorously verify outputs and understand their limitations. As one user summarized, "Treat LLMs like a shaky intern: double-check their work, and don’t trust them with the keys to the kingdom."
