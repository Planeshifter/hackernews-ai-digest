### Computer chip with built-in human brain tissue gets military funding

#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/computers/human-brain-chip-ai/) | 59 points | by [clumsysmurf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=clumsysmurf) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36821266)

Researchers at Monash University have developed a computer chip called "DishBrain" that combines human and mouse brain cells with electronic circuits and AI intelligence. The chip showed impressive learning capabilities by playing Pong within five minutes. It can read and stimulate brain cells, making it a potential breakthrough for machine learning, robotics, and drug discovery. The project has now received a $407,000 grant from Australia's National Intelligence and Security Discovery Research Grants program. The funding will be used to develop better AI machines that replicate the learning capabilities of biological neural networks.

The discussion on the submission starts with a user making a joke about a bestselling novel called "Please Dont Build Torment Nexus." The next user expresses concern about the potential military applications of this technology, suggesting that it may lead to the destruction of humanity. Other users point out that major players in the AI field are partially funded by the military, and there is a discussion about the ethics and potential dangers of AI in general.

Another user brings up the video game Xenogears and its relevance to the discussion. There is then a comment about science fiction movies and the problem of machines taking over and commanding disorganized groups, to which another user jokingly responds that even President Obama would be unsure about AI. The conversation briefly shifts to discussing the movie Ghost in the Shell.

Some users make lighthearted comments about the funding received by the project, joking about RoboCop and its cost. Others discuss the ethical concerns of connecting brain cells to silicon chips, with one user suggesting that humans should not be treated as machines and raising issues related to reproductive healthcare.

There is a discussion about the number of neurons in different animals and the comparison to the DishBrain chip's capabilities. Some users argue that logical neurons and artificial neurons are different, while others believe they are similar. The conversation takes a humorous turn, suggesting that human consciousness is beyond comprehension.

One user talks about the disappointment of AI research, suggesting that it has not lived up to its potential. There is a mention of the CPU's dominance and the possibility of using donated rat brains to play games. Another user mentions the Thought Emporium's DIY version of similar technology.

Some users continue the lighthearted discussion with comments about kitten brains and nonsensical phrases. Another user expresses bewilderment, followed by comments about the limitations of transmitting brains over the internet.

There is a debate about the investment in the project and the incremental improvements being made. One user makes a pop culture reference to Fallout 3. A discussion about the capabilities of living tissue and replicating it in software ensues.

A user brings up the concept of "Robobrains," linking it to the DishBrain project. Another user mentions Peter Watts' Rifters trilogy, and there is a mention of the game Quake and its plot. The conversation touches on Cordwainer Smith's writing and the idea of growing brain cells connected to electronics. The discussion concludes with a positive comment about the submission.

### Why did Meta open-source Llama 2?

#### [Submission URL](https://matt-rickard.com/why-did-meta-open-source-llama) | 72 points | by [rckrd](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rckrd) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36817938)

Meta, formerly known as Facebook, has open-sourced Llama 2, an advanced language model. The move has raised questions about the company's motivations. One analysis suggests that Meta's decision aligns with various strategic open-source categories, including hiring, marketing, go-to-market, reducing competitors' advantage, goodwill, and standards lobbying. The author also presents four specific reasons why companies open-source machine learning models, such as possessing proprietary data without enough resources or expertise, recruiting and retaining researchers, selling hardware or cloud resources, or having a breakthrough insight. The Llama 2 license and launch announcement provide further insight into Meta's goals. The author hypothesizes that Meta aims to reduce competitors' advantages, particularly those with proprietary models like Google and OpenAI, as well as companies in the serving stack looking to build their audience. Additionally, the author suggests that Meta may offer Llama 2 as a free-tier or complementary service, potentially integrating it into platforms like Instagram, Threads, or Facebook. Other possibilities include developing specialized hardware or data centers for Llama, providing an ML framework compatible with Llama, or offering a future commercial managed service. Finally, the author notes that Meta stands to gain a reputation as a cutting-edge company if they handle the open-sourcing of Llama 2 well. However, they acknowledge that Meta faces a challenging task in achieving this reputation but emphasizes the importance of shipping products.

The discussion revolves around whether Meta's open-sourcing of Llama 2 can be considered truly open source and the implications of this move. Some commenters point out that the license and terms of Llama 2 do not align with the open-source definition, and that it is more of a distribution model rather than true open source. Others discuss the potential motivations behind Meta's decision, including strategic advantages in hiring, marketing, and reducing competitors' advantages. There is also speculation about how Meta might integrate Llama 2 into their platforms or potentially offer it as a free-tier or complementary service. The discussion also touches on the challenges Meta may face in establishing themselves as a cutting-edge company and the importance of shipping products. Another point of discussion is the impact of the open-sourcing of Llama 2 on the open-source community and the concerns about setting a precedent for companies to selectively release their models without adhering to true open-source principles.
