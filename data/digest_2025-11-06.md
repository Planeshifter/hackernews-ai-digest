### You should write an agent

#### [Submission URL](https://fly.io/blog/everyone-write-an-agent/) | 884 points | by [tabletcorry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tabletcorry) | [348 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45840088)

Ptacek argues the best way to develop a grounded opinion on LLM agents—pro or con—is to build one, because it’s shockingly easy and deeply instructive.

What he shows:
- A minimal chat loop: ~15 lines using OpenAI’s Responses API. The “context window” is just a list of past messages you resend each turn; the model itself is stateless.
- Personas and state are illusions you construct client-side. He demos a coin-flip between “truthful Alph” and “lying Ralph” by swapping contexts.
- “Agent,” per Simon Willison’s popular definition, = LLM in a loop + tools. Adding tools is mostly wiring:
  - Declare a tool via a JSON schema (e.g., a ping function).
  - Let the model request a function_call, execute it, then feed the output back as function_call_output.
  - Iterate until there are no more tool calls, then return the model’s final answer.
- The result: the agent pings Google and summarizes connectivity—showing how a tiny bit of code unlocks real-world actions plus synthesis.

Why it matters:
- Demystifies agents: the hard part isn’t magic, it’s just message history, a loop, and a little glue.
- You quickly learn what “context,” “state,” and “tool use” actually mean in practice—useful whether you’re a skeptic or a believer.

Here's a concise summary of the key points from the discussion:

### Core Themes
1. **Specialized vs. Universal Agents**
   - Debates on targeted agents (e.g., home automation) versus broad models like Claude. Specialized agents can run locally with smaller models (10% of foundation model size), ensuring privacy and cost efficiency.
   - Counterargument: Task-specific agents struggle with complex scenarios (e.g., non-routine lighting commands) and lose flexibility.

2. **Architecture & Implementation**
   - **Composition**: Breaking tasks into smaller agents (e.g., transcription, code review) is preferred over monolithic designs to avoid context-switching overhead.
   - **Local Execution**: Users report success with local LLMs (e.g., Mistral, Whisper.cpp) for voice transcription, privacy, and determinism. Tools like Parakeet and ElevenLabs simplify synthesis.
   - **Cost Concerns**: Fine-tuned domain-specific models reduce compute costs versus API calls to foundation models.

3. **Code Agent Challenges**
   - Skepticism about replacing senior engineers: Code agents face "conceptual structural problems" (context management, scaling) and are "incredibly hard" to build reliably.
   - Hype caution: Comparisons to short-lived JS frameworks (Ember/Backbone), with senior engineers unlikely to be replaced soon.

4. **Voice/Audio Integration**
   - Whisper.cpp and Faster-whisper praised for local transcription, though latency challenges persist. 
   - Hardware setups (VOIP gateways + NUCs) enable real-time systems, e.g., Alf-themed voice agents.

5. **Ethical/Risk Warnings**
   - Claude Code usage may violate TOS if used to extract API tokens or circumvent access controls.
   - Users predict account suspensions for automating token extraction via request interception.

### Notable Projects & Tools
- `hubcap`: CLI tool using LLMs as Unix-like text manipulators (minimal PHP code).
- `Handy`/`Parakeet`: Open-source tools for local voice synthesis.
- `Willow AI`, `Speech2Speech`, `EchoMate`: Voice agent solutions.
- Anthropic’s caching strategy: Contrasted with OpenAI’s "cache everything" approach for efficiency.

### Key Takeaways
The discussion emphasizes **practical experimentation** with agents while highlighting trade-offs:  
🔹 *Local/specialized agents* → Privacy/cost benefits but limited flexibility.  
🔹 *Voice integration* → Feasible with local models, though latency and accuracy vary.  
🔹 *Code agents* → Powerful for narrow tasks but unrealistic for complex engineering.  
🔸 **Ethical boundaries** (e.g., Claude Code token extraction) are flagged as critical risks.

The discussion reflects broader tensions in AI geopolitics, with energy infrastructure and state support emerging as critical battlegrounds.

### LLMs encode how difficult problems are

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18147) | 160 points | by [stansApprentice](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stansApprentice) | [31 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45838564)

- What’s new: The authors probe whether large language models internally represent “problem difficulty” in a way that matches human intuition—and how that signal behaves during RL fine-tuning.
- How they tested: Trained simple linear probes across layers/tokens on 60 models, using math and coding tasks from Easy2HardBench. Compared two signals: human-labeled difficulty vs. “LLM-derived difficulty” from model performance. Also did representation steering along the learned “difficulty direction.” Tracked both signals during GRPO training of Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B.
- Key findings:
  - Human-labeled difficulty is strongly linearly decodable from activations (ρ ≈ 0.88 on AMC) and improves with model size.
  - Difficulty inferred from model performance is weaker and doesn’t scale well.
  - Steering activations toward “easier” reduces hallucinations and boosts accuracy.
  - During RL (GRPO), the human-difficulty probe strengthens and correlates positively with test accuracy; the LLM-derived difficulty weakens and correlates negatively as models improve.
- Why it matters: Suggests a robust, human-aligned difficulty signal lives inside LLMs and can guide training, curricula, or on-the-fly control for reliability. Automated difficulty estimates based on model outputs may become misleading precisely as models get better.
- Extras: Code and evaluation scripts are released for replication.

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18147

**Summary of Discussion on "LLMs Encode How Difficult Problems Are":**

1. **Skepticism About Reasoning Abilities**:  
   - Users debated whether LLMs genuinely understand problem difficulty or merely mimic patterns through analogy-making. Critics argued that LLMs lack true reasoning, relying instead on compressed training data and statistical correlations (*nvd*, *lkv*).  

2. **Technical Discussions**:  
   - **Kolmogorov Complexity**: A thread explored the relevance of Kolmogorov complexity (shortest program to reproduce data) as a metric for problem difficulty, contrasting "simple" vs. "random" objects (*brtw*, *bxtr*).  
   - **Text Compression & Activation Steering**: Participants discussed how LLMs compress text into activations, with some noting inconsistencies in solving complex vs. simple problems (*kzntr*). Steering activations toward "easier" directions was seen as a way to reduce hallucinations (*lyrc*, *sprjm*).  

3. **Model Architecture & Training**:  
   - Users compared Transformers’ retrieval mechanisms to "vector space navigation," where tokens are generated by aligning with relevant directions (*sprjm*, *Terr_*). Concerns were raised about automated difficulty metrics becoming unreliable as models improve (*WhyOhWhyQ*).  

4. **Human-Aligned vs. Model-Derived Signals**:  
   - Supporters emphasized the paper’s finding that human-aligned difficulty signals scale robustly with model size, unlike weaker model-derived metrics. This was seen as critical for guiding training curricula and reliability (*th0ma5*, *nrglnrd*).  

5. **Practical Implications**:  
   - Suggestions included using difficulty probes for curriculum learning or real-time control. However, warnings emerged about over-relying on training data simplicity biases (*ToValueFunfetti*).  

6. **Related Work & Metaphors**:  
   - References to Anthropic’s research and quantum metaphors (*kgnpppn*) highlighted broader debates about interpretability. Some users stressed the need to move beyond pattern recognition toward fundamental understanding (*th0ma5*).  

**Key Takeaway**: While the paper’s discovery of human-aligned difficulty signals was praised, the discussion underscored ongoing tensions between LLMs’ statistical prowess and their lack of intrinsic reasoning, urging caution in interpreting automated metrics.

### Show HN: Dynamic code and feedback walkthroughs with your coding Agent in VSCode

#### [Submission URL](https://www.intraview.ai/hn-demo) | 37 points | by [cyrusradfar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cyrusradfar) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45837067)

- The pitch: Coding is getting commoditized, but understanding systems isn’t. Intraview is a VS Code (and Cursor) extension that helps you and your AI agent build and share visual “code tours” so teams can grok how things work, review changes, and align on next steps.
- How it works: Connects your existing agent (e.g., Claude, GPT-style) via a local MCP server to generate guided tours of a repo or PR. Those tours double as structured feedback sessions, with agent-supplied context on architecture, flow, and rationale.
- Use cases: Onboarding to unfamiliar repos, reviewing agent-generated code, walking through colleagues’ PRs, and planning refactors—keeping a live mental model of the system.
- Privacy: Designed to be local-first; external calls are limited to anonymous usage telemetry to Azure for feature prioritization.
- Demo: The author walks through cloning Plotly JS, installing Intraview, and creating a tour to learn how to build a new visualization—showing how the tool helps give targeted feedback to agents.

Author asks for HN feedback and invites follow-along on LinkedIn.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion:

### Key Themes  
1. **Technical Q&A**:  
   - A user asked about synchronization across developers, auto-invalidation of code tours, and manual refresh mechanics.  
   - The author (**cyrsrdfr**) clarified that tours are stored as JSON files, with agents handling re-validation when code shifts (e.g., line changes). They described structured feedback, intent rebuilding, and criteria for synthetic requests.  

2. **Skepticism & Interest**:  
   - A skeptic (**mck-pssm**) found the demo "neat" but questioned practicality, citing challenges with onboarding and bespoke frameworks. They wondered if the tool could help locate critical code in custom systems.  
   - Others hinted at comparisons to tools like **Claude Code Copilot**, with the author noting they tested GPT-4/5 and Claude variants (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku) but not Copilot directly.  

3. **Integration & Use Cases**:  
   - Discussion touched on IDE compatibility (VS Code, Cursor) and themes.  
   - Emphasis on onboarding/PR reviews: Tours act as "interactive documentation" to streamline understanding for new contributors or post-PR refactors.  

4. **Author Engagement**:  
   - The creator actively addressed questions, invited deeper discussion via LinkedIn, and shared testing details (e.g., agents, themes).  

### Takeaways  
The tool sparked curiosity about its ability to manage evolving codebases, though skeptics sought clearer use cases for complex, custom systems. The author emphasized privacy (local-first design) and adaptability across AI models.

### Show HN: qqqa – A fast, stateless LLM-powered assistant for your shell

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/matisojka/qqqa) | 148 points | by [iagooar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iagooar) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45833811)

- What it is: A Rust-based, two-command CLI that brings LLM help to the terminal without chat sessions. qq is a quick Q&A tool; qa is a one-step “agent” that can optionally read/write a file or run a command—with confirmation.
- Why it’s interesting: It’s deliberately stateless and single-shot, embracing Unix-style composability. No hidden conversation memory; predictable, reproducible runs. Plays nicely with pipes, stdin, and scripts.
- Safety by design: qq is read-only. qa limits itself to a single tool action per invocation and requires user confirmation, with safety checks around file and command access.
- Features:
  - OpenAI-compatible client with streaming
  - Simple XML-like tags rendered to ANSI colors
  - Configurable providers/profiles per model, plus optional no-emoji mode
  - Optional terminal history hints and piped stdin for context
- Providers: OpenRouter (default), OpenAI, Groq, and local Ollama; Anthropic profile is stubbed but not yet active. Defaults include gpt-4.1-nano (OpenRouter), gpt-5-mini (OpenAI), openai/gpt-oss-20b (Groq), llama3.1 (Ollama). Optional reasoning_effort for GPT-5 models (defaults to minimal for speed).
- Setup: brew tap iagooar/qqqa && brew install qqqa on macOS; Linux tarballs from Releases. Run qq --init or qa --init to pick a provider and set keys (env vars supported).
- Extras: MIT-licensed. Optional “no fun” mode to drop emojis. Stars/forks at posting: ~241/6.

Who it’s for: Developers who want fast, predictable, shell-first LLM assistance that’s safer than free-form agents and easy to wire into existing command-line workflows.

### The Learning Loop and LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://martinfowler.com/articles/llm-learning-loop.html) | 128 points | by [johnwheeler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johnwheeler) | [73 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45841056)

Core idea: Software isn’t an assembly line. Design emerges while coding, through tight feedback with people and running systems. LLMs risk reviving a flawed “design first, implement later” mindset unless used to accelerate learning, not replace it.

Highlights:
- Developers aren’t mere implementers; they co-discover design through code and collaboration—an Agile staple worth remembering.
- LLMs shine at lowering the “Hello, World” barrier: bootstrapping projects, wiring deps, nudging configs, naming, and boilerplate.
- They falter as autonomous builders: outputs often look plausible yet misalign with deeper design intent, requiring rewrites.
- Learning is a loop you can’t outsource:
  1) Observe/understand (docs, code)
  2) Experiment/try (hands-on, break things)
  3) Recall/apply (transfer to new contexts)
  The struggle and “aha” moments create durable skill; AI can’t do that part for you.
- Learning paths are personal; processes should respect developers’ central role in discovery.

Why it matters: Treat LLMs as brainstorming partners that speed setup and experimentation, not as replacements for thinking. Use them to tighten feedback loops, validate with tests, and keep humans in the learning loop where real expertise forms.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on "The Learning Loop and LLMs":**

The discussion revolves around Unmesh Joshi’s article advocating for LLMs as tools to **accelerate learning loops** in software development, not replace human critical thinking. Key points from the debate:

1. **LLMs as Assistants, Not Replacements**:  
   - Agreed that LLMs excel at bootstrapping projects, boilerplate, and dependency wiring, but **fail at deep design alignment**. Users shared experiences of LLM-generated code requiring rewrites due to plausible-yet-misguided outputs.  
   - Warning against treating LLMs as "autonomous builders"—iterative use alongside human judgment (e.g., testing, refactoring) is crucial.  

2. **The Irreplaceable Human Learning Loop**:  
   - Emphasis on **hands-on struggle** (observe → experiment → recall) as key to durable skill development. Comments highlighted how writing code reveals unspecified requirements and architectural gaps, which LLMs might obscure.  
   - Concerns that over-reliance on LLMs could skip essential "aha moments," leading to superficial understanding.  

3. **Debates on Abstraction & Skill Development**:  
   - Some argued high-level abstractions (e.g., modern languages) let developers focus on complex problems without low-level drudgery. Others countered that **understanding fundamentals** (e.g., memory management) remains critical, even if abstracted away.  
   - A side thread questioned whether "learning styles" are relevant, with skepticism about formal theories but agreement that personalized discovery matters.  

4. **Process vs. Flexibility**:  
   - Criticism of rigid processes stifling creativity. Users advocated for tools/processes that respect developers’ need to experiment, break things, and iteratively refine.  

**Takeaway**: The consensus leans toward using LLMs as **brainstorming partners** to speed up setup and trial phases, while guarding against outsourcing the learning struggle. Human-centric design, testing, and deep understanding remain irreplaceable.

### AI Slop vs. OSS Security

#### [Submission URL](https://devansh.bearblog.dev/ai-slop/) | 184 points | by [mooreds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds) | [117 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45834303)

A veteran bug hunter turned HackerOne triage lead argues that AI is flooding open source with low-quality, hallucinated vulnerability reports—“AI slop”—and it’s burning out maintainers.

The gist
- Two flavors of AI reports: valid (fine) and non‑valid “slop” (the problem). Using AI to polish prose is OK; outsourcing validation and reproduction to an LLM is not.
- LLMs lack project-specific threat models. They pattern‑match “vuln‑shaped” code and invent exploit paths that aren’t actually possible.
- Incentives drive mass submissions. It’s not just bounties—CVE-as-trophy marketing also fuels volume. Some submitters hope maintainers will sort it out.
- The cost is real. Daniel Stenberg (curl) reportedly sees ~20% of incoming security reports as AI slop, while genuine vulns are ~5%—roughly 4 fake reports per real one, each consuming hours to disprove.
- Platforms are starting to react as OSS projects complain, but human capital is finite. Triage teams can cope; maintainers who must fix issues are drowning.

Why it matters
- The signal-to-noise collapse wastes scarce expert time, delays real fixes, and erodes trust in community reporting.
- CVE inflation risks turning vulnerability IDs into vanity metrics rather than useful security artifacts.
- Healthy AI use: assist with structure and clarity. Unhealthy AI use: skip reading code, skip reproducing, and submit conjecture.

Takeaway: AI is fine for prose; it’s terrible as a substitute for proof. If you can’t reproduce and demonstrate impact in-scope, don’t ship it—don’t feed the slop.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on AI-Generated Security Reports ("AI Slop")**

The discussion revolves around the growing problem of AI-generated low-quality security vulnerability reports ("AI slop") flooding open-source projects, overwhelming maintainers. Key points include:

### **Core Issues**  
1. **Hallucinated Reports**: LLMs (like GPT) generate plausible-sounding but incorrect vulnerability claims by pattern-matching "vuln-shaped" code without understanding project-specific threat models.  
2. **Incentives Drive Volume**: Submitters prioritize CVEs as trophies or marketing tools, outsourcing validation to maintainers. Platforms reward quantity over quality.  
3. **Burnout Impact**: Maintainers (e.g., curl’s Daniel Stenberg) report spending hours debunking fake reports (~20% AI slop vs. ~5% real vulnerabilities).  

### **Community Reactions**  
- **Cargo Cult Parallels**: AI-generated reports mimic the form of legitimate research but lack substance, likened to "cargo cult" security practices.  
- **Trust Erosion**: Flooded maintainers struggle to prioritize genuine issues, delaying fixes and eroding trust in community reporting.  
- **Platform Responses**: Some platforms are tightening rules, but human triage capacity remains finite.  

### **Debates & Solutions**  
- **Validation Crisis**: LLMs cannot reliably reproduce or contextualize exploits. Submitters often skip manual validation, expecting maintainers to "sort it out."  
- **Blocking AI Content?**: Proposals to filter AI slop face pushback; many argue the root issue is incentives, not tools.  
- **Healthy vs. Unhealthy AI Use**: Using LLMs to polish prose is acceptable, but outsourcing validation or exploit proof is harmful.  

### **Broader Implications**  
- **CVE Inflation**: CVEs risk becoming vanity metrics rather than meaningful security artifacts.  
- **Systemic Flaws**: Volunteer-driven OSS projects lack resources to handle AI-spammed reports, highlighting unsustainable incentive structures.  

### **Notable Analogies**  
- **LinkedIn-Style Slop**: AI-generated reports often resemble verbose, substance-free LinkedIn posts—long on buzzwords, short on actionable insights.  
- **Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect**: Users trust LLM outputs despite knowing their tendency to hallucinate, mirroring flawed human trust in flawed systems.  

**Takeaway**: The community urges submitters to manually validate findings and demonstrate exploit impact. While AI can assist, it cannot replace proof. Platforms and maintainers need systemic reforms to curb AI slop without stifling innovation.

### Brain-IT: Image Reconstruction from fMRI via Brain-Interaction Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://AmitZalcher.github.io/Brain-IT/) | 47 points | by [SerCe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SerCe) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45830808)

- What’s new: A team proposes Brain-IT, a “brain-inspired” pipeline that reconstructs images people see from their fMRI signals. The core is a Brain Interaction Transformer (BIT) that groups voxels into functional clusters shared across subjects, then predicts two localized, complementary image features: high-level semantic cues and low-level structural cues.

- How it works:
  - Shared Voxel-to-Cluster mapping: every voxel maps to one of many functional clusters common to all subjects, enabling data sharing across brains.
  - BIT modules:
    - Brain Tokenizer aggregates voxel activity into cluster-level “brain tokens.”
    - Cross-Transformer refines these tokens and uses query tokens to output localized image features.
  - Two-branch reconstruction:
    - Low-level branch predicts VGG-style structural features to build a coarse image (via a Deep Image Prior) that sets the layout.
    - Semantic branch predicts high-level features to guide a diffusion model toward the correct content.
  - All components are shared across clusters and subjects for efficient training and transfer.

- Results (NSD dataset):
  - With full 40 hours per subject, reconstructions show stronger semantic fidelity and structural accuracy than leading baselines (e.g., MindEye2, MindTuner), and Brain-IT tops 7 of 8 quantitative metrics across subjects.
  - Data efficiency:
    - Meaningful reconstructions with just 15 minutes of fMRI for a new subject.
    - With 1 hour of subject-specific data, performance is comparable to prior methods trained on 40 hours.

- Why it matters: Prior diffusion-based approaches often drift semantically or miss structure. By directly coupling brain-cluster signals to localized image features and sharing representations across subjects, Brain-IT improves faithfulness while slashing subject-specific data needs.

- Caveats:
  - Still depends on fMRI (expensive, slow, controlled settings).
  - Quality, privacy, and generalization beyond NSD remain practical considerations.

   - Users compare the technology to the 1983 film *Brainstorm*, which explores recording and experiencing others' thoughts, highlighting both enthusiasm for the potential to "record dreams" and darker historical anecdotes (e.g., Natalie Wood’s death during the film’s production).  

2. **Ethical & Privacy Concerns:**  
   - Many express unease about the implications of directly "reading" brain activity, such as non-consensual data extraction ("interrogations no longer require talking") and the existential fear of a "cheatable universe" if thoughts become accessible.  

3. **Technical Curiosity:**  
   - Questions arise about the training process and fidelity of reconstructed images, with one user noting the lack of clarity around how discrepancies between inferred and actual images are resolved.  

4. **Comparisons to Existing Tech:**  
   - Some speculate whether similar approaches could work with EEG (electroencephalography) or electromyography, though others suggest fMRI’s spatial resolution gives it an edge.  

5. **Mixed Reactions:**  
   - While praised as "incredible" and a "super cool step closer" to neurotech applications, concerns about practicality ("losing job isn’t pointless work") and dystopian outcomes ("cool but a little scary") persist.  

**Key Themes:**  
- Hope for revolutionary applications (e.g., dream recording) clashes with fears of misuse.  
- References to sci-fi underscore both inspiration and caution.  
- Technical details and real-world limitations (e.g., fMRI’s cost) temper excitement.

### The trust collapse: Infinite AI content is awful

#### [Submission URL](https://arnon.dk/the-trust-collapse-infinite-ai-content-is-awful/) | 225 points | by [arnon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arnon) | [201 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45833496)

TL;DR: As AI drives the cost of “credible-looking” outreach to near zero, buyers stop engaging because the cognitive cost of verifying what’s real now exceeds the expected benefit. The classic marketing funnel is losing to a “trust funnel” where durability, differentiation, and proof you’ll still care in 12 months matter more than features or price.

What the author argues:
- Content is now effectively free to produce, so everyone looks polished and “personalized.” That makes everything suspect.
- Buyers aren’t asking “does your product work?” They assume it does. They’re asking “why should I trust you specifically?”
- Signal-to-noise has flipped: inboxes are flooded; pattern-recognizing what’s human vs. automated no longer works, so people ignore all outreach.
- The old marketing funnel (optimize for conversion) needs to give way to a trust funnel (optimize for relationship, retention, and advocacy).

Memorable data point:
- Old world: ~10 “credible” outreaches/week, humans could filter ~80% accurately.
- New world: ~200/week, filter accuracy ~20%.
- Result: cost of verification > expected value of engagement, so prospects don’t engage at all.

What buyers actually want to know now:
- Will you still be here a year from now, post-integration?
- How are you truly different from the other five with identical claims?
- Are your unit economics real, or just VC-subsidized?
- What happens when the music stops—do I get stranded?

Implications for builders and sellers:
- Ship proof-of-work, not spray-and-pray: public roadmaps, changelogs, SLAs, transparent pricing, customer references, named case studies.
- Reduce automation tells: fewer sequences, more verifiable context, double-opt-in intros, show your work.
- Shift metrics: less “meetings booked,” more retained revenue, repeat buys, and advocacy.
- Invest in compounding trust assets: community, support quality, founder presence, thoughtful long-form that couldn’t be auto-generated.
- Make durability legible: financial basics, uptime history, security posture, how you make money.

Bottom line: In a world of infinite AI-generated “credibility,” trust—not content—becomes the scarce resource. Optimize for being unmistakably real.

The Hacker News discussion around "The trust collapse: when infinite AI content nukes outbound" reflects a mix of agreement, skepticism, and expanded critiques. Key themes include:

### Core Reactions to the Original Thesis  
1. **Trust Crisis Validation**: Many agree AI-generated content floods channels (email, ads, etc.), making human verification impossible. As one user notes:  
   - *"Old world: ~10 credible outreaches/week → 80% accuracy. New world: ~200/week → 20% accuracy."*  
   This collapse forces buyers to prioritize durability and transparency over features.

2. **Critiques of Capitalism & VC Incentives**:  
   - Comments liken VC-driven growth to "feeding Moloch," arguing it prioritizes short-term metrics over trust.  
   - Skepticism arises about startups’ longevity: *"Will you still be here post-integration? Are unit economics real, or VC-subsidized?"*  

3. **AI’s Societal Impact**:  
   - Fears about AGI/ASI (Artificial General/Superintelligence) escaping human control, with capitalism accelerating risks.  
   - References to "Torment Nexus" (a dystopian tech metaphor) and debates over whether AI will centralize power or democratize innovation.

### Practical Advice Echoed  
- **Builders should focus**:  
  - **Proof-of-work**: Public roadmaps, SLAs, transparent pricing.  
  - **Reduce automation tells**: Fewer sequences, verifiable context (e.g., double-opt-in intros).  
  - **Trust metrics**: Retained revenue > meetings booked.  

### Counterarguments & Nuances  
- **Trust ≠ Altruism**: Some argue trust is a byproduct of good products, not marketing: *"Trust isn’t primary motivation—build things people want."*  
- **Growth vs. Sustainability**: Debates on "net-growth" (capitalist) vs. "no-growth" (steady-state) models, with users questioning if infinite scalability aligns with human needs.  
- **AI’s Role in Distraction**: Critics blame AI-driven content for eroding attention spans, likening it to "hypnodrones" (hypnotic distractions).  

### Memorable Quotes  
- *"In a world of infinite AI-generated credibility, trust becomes the scarce resource."*  
- *"Culture matters. People’s actions are informed by socialized observation."*  
- *"Evil continues. Sometimes fight decline, sometimes shrug. Let’s label problems and solve them."*  

### Bottom Line  
The discussion amplifies the original post’s warning about AI commoditizing credibility but diverges on solutions. While some advocate transparency and durability, others critique systemic issues (VC incentives, capitalism) or warn of existential AI risks. Trust-building is seen as urgent yet complicated by competing priorities and skepticism about "realness" in an automated world.

### The Company Quietly Funneling Paywalled Articles to AI Developers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/11/common-crawl-ai-training-data/684567/) | 29 points | by [breve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=breve) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45835090)

Headline: The Atlantic says Common Crawl is a back door for training on paywalled news

- The Atlantic’s AI Watchdog reports that Common Crawl, the nonprofit that archives the web at petabyte scale, has enabled AI companies (OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia) to train on paywalled journalism despite publicly claiming it doesn’t go “behind paywalls.”
- Technical angle: many news sites briefly render full articles before client-side paywall code executes. Common Crawl’s bot doesn’t run that code, so it captures the full text. Result: millions of paywalled articles from outlets like the NYT, WSJ, The Economist, LAT, The New Yorker, Harper’s, and The Atlantic allegedly sit in CC’s archives.
- The piece alleges Common Crawl misled publishers about removals and “masked” what’s in its archives. Example: after NYT asked for past content to be removed (mid-2023), CC was said to have complied; The Atlantic found many Times articles still present. NYT now says CC removed “the majority” and is “working on full removal.”
- Common Crawl’s executive director, Rich Skrenta, argues for broad access, saying robots should be allowed to “read the books,” and that publishers who don’t want content used shouldn’t put it online. He frames LLMs as “Search 2.0.”
- Blocking surge: CCBot has become the most-blocked crawler among the top 1,000 sites, surpassing GPTBot. But robots.txt only stops future crawls; it doesn’t purge already archived pages.
- Stakes: Researchers credit Common Crawl as foundational to modern LLMs (used heavily in GPT-3/3.5). As models summarize and paraphrase the news, publishers argue this diverts readers and value; legal fights (e.g., NYT vs OpenAI) loom over fair use, consent, and data provenance.

Why it matters
- If true, this undermines claims of consent-based training and intensifies the paywalled-content dispute. It also spotlights a core tension: open web archiving for research vs. commercial AI training at scale.

What to watch
- Publisher audits and takedown demands against CC archives
- Any changes to CC’s crawler behavior or public indexing
- Legal rulings shaping whether archived paywalled pages can be used for training
- Technical shifts by publishers toward server-side paywalls to avoid pre-render leaks

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about Common Crawl and paywalled content:

### Key Debates  
1. **Technical Workaround**:  
   - Critics argue Common Crawl exploits client-side paywall implementations by scraping full articles before JavaScript paywall code executes. Publishers like NYT and The Atlantic claim this violates their paywall integrity.  
   - A user notes: *"News sites briefly render full articles before paywall scripts load. CC’s bot doesn’t run that code, so it captures the text anyway."*  

2. **Publisher Responsibility**:  
   - Many commenters blame publishers for relying on client-side paywalls: *"If you don’t want bots scraping paywalled content, implement server-side paywalls."*  
   - Others counter that publishers prioritized user experience and ad tracking over security, leaving vulnerabilities.  

3. **Ethical/Legal Tensions**:  
   - Common Crawl’s director, Rich Skrenta, is criticized for dismissing concerns: *"His argument boils down to ‘If it’s online, it’s free’—a corporate-friendly reinterpretation of open web ideals."*  
   - Legal gray areas: GDPR compliance, fair use, and whether archived paywalled content qualifies as "publicly available" for AI training.  

4. **Proposed Solutions**:  
   - Shift to server-side paywalls (*"The fix is trivial technically, but publishers prioritized ads over security"*).  
   - Calls for stricter data provenance standards in AI training.  

### Notable Quotes  
- **On hypocrisy**: *"Publishers built businesses on tracking users and serving ads, then act shocked when bots treat their content as public."*  
- **On legality**: *"If CC’s archives contain paywalled content removed via robots.txt, it’s a ticking time bomb for AI companies."*  
- **On AI ethics**: *"LLMs are ‘Search 2.0’? More like ‘Plagiarism 2.0’ when they paraphrase paywalled reporting without consent."*  

### Broader Implications  
The thread reflects a clash between open-web ideals and commercial interests, with unresolved questions about who "owns" digital content and how archival projects like Common Crawl should balance transparency with copyright compliance.

### OpenAI asks U.S. for loan guarantees to fund $1T AI expansion

#### [Submission URL](https://investinglive.com/stock-market-update/icymi-openai-asks-us-for-loan-guarantees-to-fund-1-trillion-ai-expansion-20251105/) | 190 points | by [donsupreme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=donsupreme) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45830380)

What happened
- OpenAI is exploring federal loan guarantees to finance what it calls one of the largest private infrastructure expansions ever—exceeding $1 trillion.
- CFO Sarah Friar told a WSJ conference the goal is to create an “ecosystem of banks, private equity, maybe even governmental” backers. Guarantees would lower borrowing costs by shielding lenders if OpenAI defaults.
- The approach is unusual for a Silicon Valley firm, aligning OpenAI’s financing model with energy and infrastructure projects that often rely on state support.
- Context: the company has been linked to massive commitments, including a reported $300B deal with Oracle and a $500B “Stargate” data center venture with Oracle and SoftBank. Friar said an IPO is “not on the cards.”

Why it matters
- Signals a shift toward public–private financing for AI compute, potentially normalizing state-backed capital for data centers, chips, and power.
- Could crowd in large pools of private debt/equity, accelerating buildout while socializing downside risk—a classic moral-hazard debate.
- Highlights the widening gap between AI revenue (tens of billions) and the capex needed to sustain frontier models.
- Blurs lines between tech and industrial policy, with implications for energy supply, land, and permitting.

Key questions
- What agency would back the guarantees, and with what conditions (siting, security, access, pricing)?
- How would this affect competitors that don’t receive guarantees?
- Will guarantees extend to power, fabrication, and networking, not just data centers?
- How is repayment modeled if AI monetization slows?

What to watch
- Any pilot guarantee facility or Congressional oversight.
- Terms of the Oracle/SoftBank-linked “Stargate” plans.
- Responses from Microsoft and cloud providers; potential copycat requests from other AI firms.
- Signals from DOE/Ex-Im/DFC on AI infrastructure, and from regulators on antitrust and national security.

Based on the discussion, here are the key themes and reactions from Hacker News commenters:

### 🚩 Dominant Criticism: Socialized Risk, Privatized Profit  
- **Top-voted comments** condemn the model: *"Socialize risks, privatize profits"* and comparisons to the 2008 financial crisis bailouts.  
- Users frame this as taxpayer-funded corporate welfare with OpenAI/NVDA/partners reaping rewards while offloading failure risk onto the public.  

### 🤔 Skepticism on Scale and Credibility  
- **$1T figure questioned**: Many doubt the number, citing:  
  - $1T could fund *7 years* of global semiconductor fab equipment or the EU’s *entire energy infrastructure* for 2 years (based on linked reports).  
  - OpenAI’s revenue ($~2B/year) seen as mismatched with trillion-dollar ambitions.  
- **Transparency concerns**: Users note vague promises without repayment details or agency oversight.  

### 💣 Broader Concerns  
- **AI bubble fears**: Comments call this a symptom of irrational hype, potentially inflating an "aristocracy" (Anthropic, Google, Nvidia) on public debt.  
- **Political cynicism**: References to Trump/Altman ties, UAE/Binance, and "smoke and mirrors" tactics implying backroom deals.  
- **Alternatives questioned**: Why not subsidize GPU/datacenter access for broader market competition instead?  

### 🔄 Defending Arguments (Minority Views)  
- A few support strategic national investment, quoting Altman: *"Governments should own AI infrastructure as vital public utility."*  
- One user highlights practical local AI models (e.g., 20B-parameter on a laptop) as efficient alternatives to trillion-dollar builds.  

### 💬 Notable Subthreads  
- **"Surveillance tool" critique**: Smaller models could empower individuals vs. centralized, taxpayer-funded "arbitrary nonsense" (glsx).  
- **IPO dismissal**: OpenAI’s non-IPO stance dismissed as PR ("nowhere near viable").  
- **Energy impact warnings**: Inflation in energy prices due to AI infrastructure buildouts (lwlssn).  

### 💎 Key Takeaway  
The overwhelming sentiment is **hostility toward perceived corporate rent-seeking**, with warnings of moral hazard, bubble economics, and opaque political dealings. Critics demand accountability and reject "socializing risk" for private giants.
