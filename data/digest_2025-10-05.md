#### [Submission URL](https://fi-le.net/oss/) | 311 points | by [fi-le](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fi-le) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483924)

The Fiefdom of Files: What GPT-oss leaks about OpenAI’s training data

- Core idea: By inspecting the open weights of OpenAI’s GPT-oss (and the shared o200k tokenizer used across recent models), the author shows that model parameters leak clues about training data and process—down to surprisingly specific domains.

- How they probed it: They histogrammed the L2 norms of the token embedding rows. A cluster of ~936 very low-norm tokens (reserved specials and certain raw bytes) likely never appeared in training and were pulled down by weight decay—useful for inferring init variance and, in principle, total training steps. The right tail isn’t Gaussian: some tokens have unusually high norms.

- What popped out:
  - English high-norm tokens skew toward code and reasoning (“code”, “The”, “This”, “logic”, “according”, “Moreover”), hinting that code/reasoning was emphasized late in training (e.g., RL or fine-tuning) or simply received larger gradient updates.
  - Non-ASCII high-norm tokens include many Chinese spam and adult-website phrases, lottery/gambling terms, and assorted regional/odd tokens (Thai football-analysis terms, niche districts, Abkhaz/Armenian/Kannada snippets). The author argues this implies GPT-5 encountered phrases from adult sites.
  - The o200k tokenizer contains a lot of “junk” tokens; every inference still multiplies by embeddings for these, an efficiency and safety curiosity.

- Glitch tokens in the wild: A crafted Abkhaz input (“ауажәарақәа”) causes GPT-5 to output an unrelated Malayalam word (“people”), echoing prior “glitch token” phenomena (e.g., SolidGoldMagikarp) where certain byte-piece tokens behave adversarially.

- Why it matters: Even without a disclosed dataset, open weights and token stats can reveal training emphasis, data contamination (spam/adult content), and pipeline details—raising questions about data curation, safety, and the trade-offs of shared tokenizers across models.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Glitch Tokens & Model Weaknesses**:  
   - Users note the recurrence of "glitch tokens" (e.g., *SolidGoldMagikarp*) in OpenAI models, often tied to tokenizer artifacts or web-scraped data. These tokens, like the Abkhaz example triggering Malayalam output, highlight adversarial behavior in models.  
   - Some suggest **reverse-engineering** APIs or exploiting tokenizer quirks (e.g., `xddr` linked to FPGA tools or Unicode soft hyphens) could reveal training data patterns or weaknesses.

2. **Training Data Sources**:  
   - Debate arises over whether GPT-5’s training included **deleted or spammy content**, such as Chinese adult/gambling sites, GitHub repositories, or repackaged content from blocked platforms.  
   - Comments point to GitHub as a likely training source, given tokens matching repository terms. However, some argue this reflects the messy reality of web data, not intentional malpractice.

3. **Tokenizer Efficiency**:  
   - Criticism of the `o200k` tokenizer’s large size and low-quality tokens (e.g., junk phrases). Users propose smaller, optimized tokenizers could improve efficiency, especially for quantized models.

4. **Bias & Suppression**:  
   - Concerns that RLHF fine-tuning might **suppress biases** superficially without addressing deeper issues. Papers ([Carlini et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634)) are cited, arguing models retain hidden biases or memorized data despite alignment efforts.  
   - Some note cultural biases in non-English tokens (e.g., Chinese spam terms) could skew outputs for non-native users.

5. **Legal & Ethical Calls**:  
   - Strong demands for **transparency laws** requiring documentation of training data sources. Comparisons are made to Google Books’ copyright disputes, highlighting the legal gray area of training on public/private data mixtures.  
   - Skepticism about current moderation practices, with users doubting OpenAI’s ability to filter harmful content entirely.

6. **Miscellaneous Insights**:  
   - The token `xddr`’s link to GitHub scrapes and Unicode encoding errors.  
   - Humorous speculation about the `o200k` tokenizer’s name (possibly referencing 200,000 tokens).  
   - Correction of a typo to the infamous *SolidGoldMagikarp* glitch token example.

**Key Debate**: Is the presence of spammy/deleted content in training data a sign of poor curation, or an inevitable byproduct of web scraping? While some see it as a red flag, others argue it’s unavoidable, reflecting the internet’s “noisy” nature. Calls for stricter dataset accountability clash with pragmatism about current AI development practices.

### Rule-Based Expert Systems: The Mycin Experiments (1984)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.shortliffe.net/Buchanan-Shortliffe-1984/MYCIN%20Book.htm) | 83 points | by [mindcrime](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindcrime) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486306)

Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments (1984) — full book now free online

- What it is: A 754-page, out-of-print classic from Stanford’s Heuristic Programming Project, documenting the design, evaluation, and spin‑offs of MYCIN, a landmark rule-based medical expert system. All chapters are freely available.
- Why it matters: Captures the foundations of expert systems—knowledge engineering, explainability, and reasoning under uncertainty—that still inform modern AI (and serve as a sharp contrast to today’s LLMs).
- What MYCIN did: Used several hundred backward‑chaining rules and “certainty factors” to recommend antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections. It never went into clinical use, but became a touchstone for how AI can justify recommendations and separate knowledge from inference.
- Inside the book: 
  - Rule representation, inference engine, consultation flow, and therapy algorithms
  - Uncertainty handling: certainty factors, probabilistic reasoning, and Dempster–Shafer evidence
  - EMYCIN: a reusable shell for building rule‑based systems in new domains
  - Explanation generation, tutoring, and human‑factors design
  - Alternative representations (frames + rules) and meta‑level knowledge
  - A structured evaluation comparing MYCIN’s advice to infectious disease experts
- Big lessons: The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is real; explanations drive trust and learning; clear separation of knowledge base and engine aids reuse; uncertainty formalisms are pragmatic trade‑offs; deployment hinges on UX, integration, and liability as much as accuracy.
- Where to start: Ch. 11 (Inexact Reasoning), Ch. 15 (EMYCIN), Ch. 18 (Explanations), Ch. 31 (Evaluation).

Great historical read for anyone building decision support tools, explainable AI, or safety‑critical ML.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the historical significance of rule-based expert systems like MYCIN, their contrast with modern machine learning (ML), and lessons applicable to today’s AI development. Key points include:

1. **Rule-Based vs. Data-Driven Approaches**:  
   Participants highlight the trade-offs between hand-crafted rule-based systems (e.g., MYCIN) and modern ML/data-driven methods. While rule-based systems offer transparency and explainability, they face scalability and maintenance challenges (“knowledge acquisition bottleneck”). ML avoids manual rule-writing but struggles with interpretability and reliability.

2. **Historical Context**:  
   The conversation touches on pivotal moments in AI history, such as Marvin Minsky’s criticism of perceptrons in the 1960s, which stalled neural network research and fueled the rise of expert systems. MYCIN’s failure to deploy clinically (despite technical success) due to shifting pharmaceutical practices underscores the importance of real-world integration.

3. **Relevance Today**:  
   Some argue that hybrid systems combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with rule-based verification or symbolic reasoning could address modern AI’s limitations. Others note parallels between past challenges (e.g., integrating expert systems into workflows) and current issues with ML deployment (e.g., monitoring, interpretability).

4. **Lessons from MYCIN**:  
   Participants emphasize MYCIN’s enduring lessons:  
   - **Explainability** drives trust and usability.  
   - **Separation of knowledge and inference** aids adaptability (e.g., EMYCIN shell).  
   - **Uncertainty handling** (e.g., certainty factors) remains relevant for decision-making systems.  

5. **Nostalgia and Revival**:  
   Older tools like OPS5 and Prolog are mentioned as inspirations, with some advocating revisiting their principles. The discussion also critiques the “AI winter” narrative, noting that expert systems’ decline was as much about hype and practicality as technical merit.

6. **Modern Experiments**:  
   Developers share experiments using LLMs for scripting and verification, suggesting that blending generative AI with structured rule-based systems could mitigate brittleness while retaining flexibility.

**Takeaway**: The MYCIN experiments and rule-based systems offer timeless insights for today’s AI, particularly in explainability, hybrid architectures, and the socio-technical challenges of deploying systems in real-world settings. The discussion reflects a community keen on learning from history to avoid repeating past mistakes.

### Managing context on the Claude Developer Platform

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management) | 214 points | by [benzguo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benzguo) | [85 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479006)

Anthropic adds “context editing” and a client-side “memory tool” to the Claude Developer Platform to tame context-window limits and power longer-running agents, launching with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

What’s new
- Context editing: Automatically prunes stale tool calls/results as you approach token limits, preserving conversation flow and focusing the model on what’s relevant.
- Memory tool: A file-based, developer-managed store (CRUD via tool calls) that lives outside the context window and persists across sessions, letting agents accumulate knowledge, project state, and learnings over time.
- Built-in awareness: Sonnet 4.5 tracks available tokens to manage context more intelligently.

Why it matters
- Longer, cheaper, more accurate runs: On Anthropic’s internal agentic-search evals, memory + context editing improved performance 39% over baseline; editing alone delivered 29%. In a 100-turn web search test, context editing avoided context exhaustion while cutting token use by 84%.
- Developer control: Memory operates entirely client-side; you choose the storage backend and persistence model—no opaque server-side state.

Use cases
- Coding: Trim old file reads/tests while persisting debugging insights and design decisions.
- Research: Keep key findings; drop outdated search results to build a durable knowledge base.
- Data processing: Store intermediates, discard raw bulk to stay under token limits.

Availability
- Public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, plus Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI. Docs and cookbook available.

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's new context editing and memory tool features reveals mixed reactions and practical insights:

### **Key Themes**
1. **Comparisons with Existing Tools**  
   - Users note similarities to Google AI Studio’s context deletion and ChatGPT’s advanced modes, but praise Claude’s client-side memory control as a differentiating factor.  
   - Skepticism arises about benchmarks, with some arguing models like Gemini or GPT-4 still outperform Claude in real-world tasks.

2. **Workflow Adaptations**  
   - Developers share workarounds for context limits: compacting message history, using terminal tools ([plqqy-terminal](https://github.com/plqqy/plqqy-terminal)), or integrating version control for persistent state.  
   - One user highlights success with Claude Code, maintaining 10% context usage via compact histories during extended sessions.

3. **Challenges & Critiques**  
   - **Hallucination Risks**: Removing context chunks might lead to inaccuracies, especially in long agent runs.  
   - **Quality Trade-offs**: Aggressive context trimming risks degrading output quality, likened to “a significant disservice” in some cases.  
   - **Client-Side Complexity**: Managing memory via CRUD operations and Markdown files adds overhead, though some appreciate the transparency vs. opaque server-side state.

4. **Developer Control**  
   - Praise for client-side memory storage (e.g., `CURRENT.md` files) but frustration with manual context management in third-party interfaces.  
   - Requests for standardized context formats (akin to LoRA adapters) to streamline manipulation across platforms.

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Optimism about enabling multi-session learning and persistent project state.  
   - Criticism of AI’s practicality for complex workflows, citing a [linked blog](https://blog.nilen.com/2025/09/15/ai-not-for-work) arguing current tools fall short.

### **Notable Quotes**
- *“Context editing feels like formalizing common patterns… but vendors locking in APIs could limit flexibility.”*  
- *“Gemini 1.5 Pro’s massive context window is a game-changer—Anthropic’s token management feels like catching up.”*  
- *“I’ve been hacking this for months—Claude’s update just makes it official.”*

### **Conclusion**  
While developers welcome Anthropic’s focus on context efficiency and client-side control, debates persist over real-world efficacy vs. marketing claims. The features address pain points but highlight broader challenges in balancing token limits, cost, and output quality for AI agents.

### Estimating AI energy use

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use) | 99 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486031)

IEEE Spectrum: The Hidden Behemoth Behind Every AI Answer

A simple “Hello” to ChatGPT rides on an enormous, fast-growing energy and infrastructure footprint. Using OpenAI’s own usage figures (700 million weekly users; 2.5 billion queries/day), Spectrum estimates nearly 1 trillion queries a year. If each query averages 0.34 Wh (a figure Sam Altman has floated without evidence), that’s about 850 MWh/day—roughly enough annualized to power ~29,000 U.S. homes. But per-query energy is highly uncertain: some researchers peg complex prompts at >20 Wh.

Zooming out, Schneider Electric’s research puts generative AI’s 2025 draw at 15 TWh, using ~2.9 Wh per query—implying ~5.1 trillion queries industry-wide. Their 2030 scenario jumps to 347 TWh/year and as many as 329 billion prompts per day (~38 per person), driven by autonomous AI agents talking to other agents. That leaves ~332 TWh of new energy demand to materialize this decade.

To keep up, AI firms are planning “Stargate-class” mega–data centers, with OpenAI and others signaling the need for dozens of them. Big picture: the bottleneck isn’t just GPUs—it’s power, land, and grid build-out. The article stresses that all these numbers have wide error bars due to limited disclosure, but the direction of travel is unmistakable: scale is the story.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy footprint revolves around the validity of estimates, infrastructure challenges, and broader implications raised in the IEEE Spectrum article. Here’s a distilled summary:

### Key Debate Points:
1. **Energy Estimates and Comparisons**  
   - Skepticism surrounds per-query energy figures (e.g., Sam Altman’s 0.34 Wh claim). Some argue training models, not just inference (queries), dominate energy use, but this is often omitted in analyses.  
   - Comparisons to other activities (e.g., a round-trip flight LA-Tokyo ≈ 1M Wh) are debated. Critics call these misleading, as AI’s impact should focus on systemic energy sinks, not individual equivalencies.  

2. **Infrastructure and Market Dynamics**  
   - Data centers strain grids, driving up electricity prices. Users note PJM Interconnection’s rates surged from $2,958/MW-day to $27,043/MW-day, hinting at broader consumer cost impacts.  
   - Some argue utilities prioritize profitable server contracts, passing infrastructure costs to residents. Others counter that market-driven pricing and long-term contracts are inevitable.  

3. **Renewables and Grid Challenges**  
   - Cheap, clean energy is seen as a solution, but political and logistical hurdles (e.g., NIMBYism, slow transmission upgrades) delay progress. Users cite Diablo Canyon’s relicensing battles and renewable project opposition as examples.  
   - Europe’s interconnected grids are discussed, but flaws emerge (e.g., Norway’s hydropower profits benefiting Germany’s industry, not locals).  

4. **Scale and Projections**  
   - The article’s 2030 projection of 347 TWh/year for AI is called a "small fraction" of global energy (≈180,000 TWh), but critics stress growth trajectories matter. Autonomous AI agents could drive exponential demand.  
   - Skeptics question whether efficiency gains can offset scaling, likening today’s AI boom to 2000s fiber-optic overinvestment.  

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about AI becoming a scapegoat for decades of underinvestment in grids. Training data centers are likened to heavy industries (e.g., steel) with concentrated energy demands.  
   - Some suggest per-user energy accounting (like India’s tiered pricing) to align costs with usage fairly.  

### Sentiment:  
While most agree AI’s energy footprint is non-trivial and growing, opinions split on severity. Optimists highlight innovation and cleaner energy potential; pessimists stress infrastructure inertia and market distortions. The discussion underscores the need for transparency, holistic lifecycle analysis (training + inference), and policy foresight.

### Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) | 38 points | by [getnormality](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=getnormality) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483205)

Implicit Actor–Critic via Supervised Learning for RL with Verifiable Rewards

What’s new: PACS reframes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a supervised learning problem. Instead of updating policies with unstable policy gradients (PPO/GRPO), it treats the verifiable outcome (e.g., correct math answer, passing tests) as a label and trains a score function with cross-entropy. The authors show this recovers the classic policy-gradient update while implicitly coupling the actor and critic, leading to more stable, efficient training.

Why it matters: RLVR has been a bright spot for LLM reasoning, but sparse rewards and high-variance updates make it brittle and hard to tune. A supervised formulation could simplify pipelines, reduce instability, and make scaling easier when rewards are easy to verify.

Results: On challenging math benchmarks, PACS beats strong RL baselines. Notably, it reaches 59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025, improving over PPO by 13.32 points and GRPO by 14.36 points.

Takeaway: If these gains generalize, PACS offers a cleaner, more robust route to post-train LLMs on tasks with verifiable feedback, potentially lowering RL complexity without sacrificing performance. Code and data are open-sourced.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the submission:

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Comparison to Decision Transformers (DTs):**  
   A user ([radarsat1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=radarsat1)) questions whether PACS overlaps with Decision Transformers, which condition on desired returns and generate actions. They note a lack of recent follow-up work on DTs and suggest a deeper comparison.

2. **Skepticism About Results:**  
   [mpssblfrk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpssblfrk) raises doubts about the reported **59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025**, arguing that stopping points for such benchmarks can be arbitrary. They also highlight that top models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Google/OpenAI) have not publicly achieved similar results, hinting at potential discrepancies.

3. **Technical Accessibility:**  
   [gtnrmlty](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gtnrmlty) critiques the paper’s dense presentation (e.g., Figures 1–2, Equation 6) but praises its core idea of leveraging supervised learning for RL stability. They also mention parallels to **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** and reference Equation 8 from the DPO paper.

4. **Related Work & Resources:**  
   [yrwb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yrwb) shares links to the [PACS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) and a related ["Winning Gold IMO 2025" pipeline paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15855), prompting thanks from others for the resources.

### Takeaways:
- The discussion reflects cautious optimism about PACS but emphasizes the need for clearer benchmarks and comparisons to existing methods (DTs, DPO).  
- Skepticism about the AIME 2025 result underscores broader concerns around reproducibility and evaluation rigor in LLM reasoning tasks.  
- The supervised learning angle is seen as promising for simplifying RL pipelines, though technical clarity remains a hurdle.

### The deadline isn't when AI outsmarts us – it's when we stop using our own minds

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/you-have-18-months) | 353 points | by [NotInOurNames](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=NotInOurNames) | [309 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45480622)

Title: “You have 18 months” — The real deadline isn’t AI surpassing us, it’s us surrendering our minds

- Derek Thompson argues the near-term risk of AI isn’t mass displacement by “a country of geniuses in a datacenter,” but human deskilling as we outsource thinking. He reframes “18 months” as the window to protect our cognitive habits, not a countdown to obsolescence.

- Core idea: thinking, like strength training, depends on “time under tension.” Slow, effortful synthesis is how ideas become original. Offloading that struggle to AI short-circuits the very process that builds judgment and creativity.

- Writing is thinking: letting LLMs draft for us fills screens with words while emptying minds of thought. A Nature editorial warns that outsourcing scientific writing erodes understanding. In education, ubiquitous AI use turns assignments into prompt engineering, not learning.

- Reading is collapsing too. Thompson cites:
  - NAEP: U.S. average reading scores at a 32-year low.
  - John Burn-Murdoch’s Financial Times analysis asking if we’ve “passed peak brain power.”
  - A professor’s account of “functional illiteracy” among college students.
  The shift to fragments (texts, feeds, subtitles) erodes the sustained attention needed for deep comprehension.

- The parental panic—“Which major is safe if AI beats us at coding, medicine, math?”—misses the present-tense problem: deteriorating habits of focus, reading, and writing that make people valuable in any field.

- Practical takeaway: use AI as a tutor or brainstorming aid, not a ghostwriter; require drafts and “show your work” in schools and teams; schedule deliberate “slow work” (reading, outlining, rewriting) to keep cognitive muscles under tension.

- The challenge for the next 18 months isn’t preventing AI from outskilling us—it’s refusing to deskill ourselves. The deadline is behavioral, not technological.
