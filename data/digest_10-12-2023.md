Today, Microsoft announced an update to the Paint app for Windows 11, introducing a new feature called Paint Cocreator. This AI-powered experience, powered by DALL-E, allows users to create artwork in Paint by simply describing what they want to create. Users can also select an art style, and Paint Cocreator will generate three variations of artwork for them to choose from. Microsoft is rolling out access to Paint Cocreator slowly, with users needing to join a waitlist to access the feature. The company is committed to responsible AI practices and has implemented content filtering and safeguards to prevent the generation of harmful or inappropriate images. Paint Cocreator is currently available in preview to users in English in select regions. Feedback on the update can be submitted through the Feedback Hub.

The discussion on Hacker News about Microsoft's update to the Paint app for Windows 11, introducing the AI-powered Paint Cocreator feature, covers various topics. 

One commenter compares Microsoft's integration of DALL-E into Paint to Adobe's use of AI in Photoshop, highlighting features such as vector models, template generation, and distraction removal. They mention that both companies are advanced in integrating AI into their tools.

The conversation then shifts to copyright concerns. One user raises the question of whether Adobe's generation of AI-trained commercial stock photos could be a copyright risk. Another user points out that copyright training data is non-copyrightable, and major copyright protection efforts may require legal reform to address the challenges posed by AI-generated content.

The pricing model of Paint Cocreator is also discussed. A commenter shares pricing details from a linked article, comparing it to Adobe's pricing for a similar feature called Firefly. They suggest that Paint Cocreator might be cheaper. Another user explains that the link provided is misleading and discusses OpenAI's DALL-E, which is expected to be integrated into Paint in 2022. They clarify that pricing details for Paint Cocreator are not yet known.

There is also mention of the removal of certain features from Paint, with one user expressing disappointment that certain intelligence seems to have been removed from the app.

The topic of content filtering and safeguards in Paint Cocreator comes up. One user suggests that if the current version of DALL-E 3 is used for filtering, triggering warnings and non-landscape filters may not be adequate.

Some users make light-hearted remarks, such as one person referring to previous AI tools like Clippy and another jokingly suggesting that Paint Cocreator could generate threatening letters.

There are brief comments on market implications and the humorous juxtaposition of AI tools constantly censoring wrong things.

Other miscellaneous comments touch on specific versions of DALL-E, the transition of Paint over Windows versions, preview notifications, the humorous aspect of certain juxtaposed features, and Microsoft emphasizing the simplicity of Paint.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.home-assistant.io/blog/2023/10/12/year-of-the-voice-chapter-4-wakewords/) | 40 points | by [M2Ys4U](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=M2Ys4U) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37862746)

Home Assistant, an open-source home automation platform, has announced the release of wake word support as part of their Year of the Voice initiative. In the fourth chapter of their journey, Home Assistant introduces wake word processing, allowing users to trigger voice commands by saying specific phrases like "Hey Google" or "Alexa." This feature is made possible through the open-source project openWakeWord, developed by David Scripka. Unlike traditional voice assistants that rely on specific hardware, Home Assistant's wake word detection is done within the platform itself, making it accessible to any device capable of streaming audio. While this approach has its limitations, such as varying audio quality and resource usage within Home Assistant, it offers flexibility and the ability to run wake word detection on external servers. Moreover, openWakeWord provides pre-trained wake word models, including Home Assistant's "Okay Nabu" model, and supports English wake words. Users can also create their own wake words without the need for real voice samples using the unique techniques of Piper, the platform's text-to-speech system. This latest addition to Home Assistant's voice capabilities brings them one step closer to their goal of enabling users to control their smart homes through voice commands in their own language.

The discussion surrounding the Home Assistant's release of wake word support is mostly positive. One user mentions that they use Home Assistant every day and voice control is a necessary feature. They acknowledge that voice control has its limitations but highlights the convenience it provides, particularly in scenarios like switching lights or opening garage doors. Another user mentions using the Rhasspy project with Alexa and finds voice control helpful for quick tasks such as checking the weather or playing music. They also mention that it is convenient for interacting with the house, especially when they have their hands full or are carrying something. Another user suggests adding an additional interface to control the home from Windows, asking about the most valuable information that can be extracted, like flickering switch activities or weather updates. Finally, a user mentions using voice control with kids in the house and notes how it simplifies interactions, such as turning lights on or off or carrying sleeping children without needing to move. They also mention using voice control for tasks like changing colors or playing specific songs. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the convenience and usefulness of voice control in home automation.

### No Fakes Act wants to protect actors and singers from unauthorized AI replicas

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/12/23914915/ai-replicas-likeness-law-no-fakes-copyright) | 62 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [83 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37863309)

A bipartisan bill called the No Fakes Act aims to protect actors, singers, and other performers from unauthorized digital replicas of their faces or voices. The bill, sponsored by Senators Chris Coons, Marsha Blackburn, Amy Klobuchar, and Thom Tillis, establishes federal rules around the use of a person's likeness. It prohibits the creation of a digital replica without the individual's consent, unless it is for specific purposes like news, sports broadcasts, or documentaries. The rights would apply throughout a person's lifetime and for 70 years after their death. The bill also includes exceptions for parodies, satire, and criticism, as well as commercial activities related to news, documentaries, or parodies. 
However, some believe the bill merely dresses up existing laws and doesn't offer additional protections. Jeremy Elman, a partner at a law firm, said it could potentially conflict with existing copyright and right of publicity laws. The No Fakes Act seeks to address the growing concern about the use of generative AI tools that mimic famous voices or create photos of famous individuals. The bill aims to federalize likeness laws, which currently vary from state to state. The Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the Human Artistry Campaign have expressed support for the bill, citing the infringement of rights by generative AI models. The bill comes in response to the increasing use of AI duplicates in various industries, including Hollywood and the music industry.


The discussion surrounding the No Fakes Act on Hacker News touched on various aspects of the bill and its implications. Some commenters expressed concerns about the bill's effectiveness, stating that it may not provide additional protections beyond existing laws. They argued that AI-generated replicas of famous individuals, such as singers and actors, could still be created and used legally under certain circumstances. Others pointed out that there is a demand for authenticity in the entertainment industry and that AI-generated performers cannot fully replace human performers. The discussion also delved into the topic of labor rights in Hollywood, with some commenters noting that AI advancements could potentially impact job opportunities for actors and writers. Additionally, there was a debate about the future of virtual actors and the potential disruption of traditional art forms by AI. Some commenters expressed skepticism about the significant impact of AI on the arts, while others highlighted the possibilities for innovation and disruption in the industry.
