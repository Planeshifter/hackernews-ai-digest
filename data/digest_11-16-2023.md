#### [Submission URL](https://flower.dev/blog/2023-11-15-federated-finetuning-of-openai-whisper-with-flower/) | 87 points | by [danieljanes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danieljanes) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38294203)

Researchers at Flower Labs have demonstrated the power of federated learning by fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for keyword spotting. This blog post provides a code example that shows how to perform this downstream task in a federated manner. By leveraging large models trained on publicly available data and federating the learning process, Flower ensures client privacy without the need to copy data to a central server. The example walks through the process of designing a federated learning pipeline with Flower for keyword spotting classification using a pre-trained Whisper encoder. The pipeline consists of client-server interactions, where the server samples clients and sends them the classification head. Each client trains the classification head using its own data and communicates the updated head back to the server. The server then aggregates the heads and sends a new global head to the clients in the next round. The researchers used the Google SpeechCommands dataset and achieved over 97% accuracy in classifying keywords after just a few rounds of training. Additionally, they benchmarked the example on the Raspberry Pi 5 and found vastly superior performance compared to the previous Raspberry Pi 4, making it suitable for demanding on-device training workloads.

One user pointed out that the article didn't mention any specific differences between the Raspberry Pi 4 and Raspberry Pi 5 in relation to Whisper. Another user responded that the larger models (like Whisper v3) are about 32 times slower than the smaller models, and they tested Whisper on a Pi 4, finding that it took around 10 minutes to transcribe a 30-second audio sample. However, they speculated that the Pi 5 would be 2-3 times faster.

The maintainer of Flower, the federated learning platform used in the example, mentioned that they were planning to do an in-depth performance comparison soon.

Another user expressed interest in people's experiences, particularly in regards to the performance of Whisper 3 on different model sizes and using double the Raspberry Pi 5. They also mentioned the importance of training specifically for inference on the Raspberry Pi 5.

There was a clarification that the Whisper versions (v2 and v3) referred to large models, with v2 being an older version and v3 being the updated version. All model sizes were mentioned to be part of the original release.

One user noted that the work presented focused on demonstrating the use of federated learning in small devices like the Raspberry Pi 5, and the bigger challenge lies in transferring models with performance improvements for training large models.

Regarding labeling in federated learning, a user suggested that Flower primarily demonstrated how to show the fun of fine-tuning models on federated devices, but the more challenging task is classifying a vast amount of data.

The topic of downstram task performance on small devices and the necessity of data labeling was discussed. It was suggested that labeling could be done either by gathering actual labels or using an auxiliary model that generates pseudo labels for training.

One user asked if it's feasible to perform fine-tuning on small devices, and another user explained that it is possible for distributed devices to move control, location, and data collection of speech recognition tasks.

The potential benefits of federated learning for data privacy were mentioned, with a user highlighting its applicability in end-to-end encryption applications.
