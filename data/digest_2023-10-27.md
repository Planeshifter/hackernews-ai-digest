#### [Submission URL](https://proofassistants.stackexchange.com/questions/1093/can-the-language-of-proof-assistants-be-used-for-general-purpose-programming) | 78 points | by [wslh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wslh) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38044420)

The user on Proof Assistants Stack Exchange is asking if proof assistants, specifically Lean/Lean4, can be used for general-purpose programming. They are curious if proof assistants can replace languages like Standard ML and if there are any limitations to using them for general-purpose programming. In response, a user mentions that in Lean, you can write programs without proving termination, and Lean 4 is designed to be usable as a general purpose language. Another user suggests looking into widgets in Lean 3 for GUI tools, which allow interaction with Lean graphically in VS Code. They also mention that there is work being done to add GUI tools to Lean 4.

The question of whether proof assistants can be used for general-purpose programming is a complex one. While most proof assistants don't resemble traditional programming languages, dependent type theory, which acts as both a programming language and a theorem prover, merges the two worlds together. In pure dependent type theory, functions are computable and can be executed, but they need to be total and have a proof of termination. This means that certain functions, like those involving infinite loops or unproven conjectures, cannot be implemented in pure dependent type theory. However, there are tricks like carrying along a counter to ensure termination and using judgmental equality to prove properties about functions.

Overall, proof assistants have the potential to be used for general-purpose programming, but there are limitations and considerations to keep in mind.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to proof assistants and their potential for general-purpose programming:
