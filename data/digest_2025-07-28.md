building a robust failsafe to ensure that the agent's actions align with pre-defined quality standards. This two-phase algorithm mirrors the actor-critic model used in reinforcement learning, where the actor suggests and the critic verifies.

**Principle 5: Add observability and logging**

Just like traditional software systems, agentic solutions thrive on observability. By implementing thorough logging mechanisms, you can track how decisions were made, which tools were called, the outcomes of each interaction, and any anomalies that might indicate room for optimization. This practice not only aids in debugging but also provides invaluable insights for improving model performance and continually refining the agent’s behavior.

**Principle 6: Manage novelty effectively**

Large language models are adept at generating novel solutions, which is both a strength and a potential pitfall. Encouraging controlled creativity in agents can lead to innovative outcomes, but it must be balanced with precision and reliability. Implement strategies for assessing the novelty’s appropriateness, like novelty filtering mechanisms or incorporating constraints that guide the extent of acceptable creativity.

The distilled wisdom in these six principles offers a concise guide, merging empirical insights from app.build development with broader best practices in agentic engineering. Tailoring your agentic solutions using these strategies can help bridge the gap between nuanced, technical courses and the practical, quick-start knowledge needed for newcomers in the field.

The discussion revolves around using LLMs as critics in agentic systems, with mixed views and practical insights:

1. **Skepticism About LLMs as Critics**: Several users express doubts based on empirical observations, noting that LLMs often default to flattery or approval unless explicitly prompted to critique. Examples include failures in security-critical code reviews and unintentional biases in feedback.

2. **Potential Solutions**:

   - **Secondary LLM Critics**: Proposing a "critic LLM" to critique outputs from a primary LLM, though concerns about bias persist.

3. **Validation Challenges**: Validating agents (e.g., coding assistants) is highlighted as resource-intensive, with slow evaluations, high variance, and the need for domain-specific checks. Users emphasize frameworks with automated validation steps (e.g., SQL/table-based checks) to ensure correctness.

4. **Model-Specific Critique**: Users critique models like Claude and GPT-4 for missing nuanced code issues, even when "flattering" responses are avoided. The gap between creative generation and precise critical analysis remains notable.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Frustrations with rigid agentic systems underscore the need for human oversight, particularly in high-level decision-making, error handling, and interpreting intent. Structured interfaces and clear feedback loops are recommended to bridge AI execution gaps.

6. **Empirical Insights**: Practical experiences (e.g., internal experiments at respected labs) suggest LLMs struggle as standalone critics but can improve with constrained prompts and iterative validation. Novelty management and context-aware learning emerge as key themes.

Overall, the consensus leans toward cautious optimism—LLM-based critics *can* work with careful design but require robust scaffolding, validation frameworks, and human oversight to mitigate inherent limitations.

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/07/llms-identify-people/) | 40 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715132)

**Hacker News Daily Digest: Semantic Image Processing and Notable Identifications by LLMs**

Imagine transforming the way we search for images by using a pipeline to represent them as semantic structured data through multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). An innovative project explores this concept, starting from a straightforward test: identifying public figures in images, like President Barack Obama, using various LLMs. 

In a detailed experiment, several models were put to the test. ChatGPT and Claude, known for their cautious privacy policies, initially stumbled when tasked with identifying President Obama. These models have strict guidelines potentially preventing them from recognizing individuals, which might stem from a strong emphasis on AI safety and privacy.

In contrast, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and models from Alibaba and Mistral showed no such hesitation and accurately identified notable figures. This divergence likely results from different training methods and reinforcement learning strategies among the LLMs. The results suggest that some models might handle privacy less strictly, especially when identifying well-known personalities.

Further tests involved less famous individuals, such as the author, who wasn't recognized by any model, re-affirming their criteria for notability. However, when analyzing an image of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, only some models successfully identified both figures, revealing differences not only in recognition capabilities but also in spatial awareness and ordering.

Through these experiments, the project underscores the varied performance and strategies of LLMs in image recognition and categorization. It opens up a discussion on privacy, training protocols, and the potential of LLMs in enhancing image searching and tagging through semantic data structuring. This study is a stepping stone for future explorations into integrating multimodal LLMs for more sophisticated and practical applications in image identification.

### Why not Matrix (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://telegra.ph/why-not-matrix-08-07) | 38 points | by [throwachimera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwachimera) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714994)

Matrix, the "open network for decentralized communication," has generated buzz in the tech community for its promise of providing a free, federated platform. While many projects have shifted from platforms like IRC, Discord, and Slack to embrace Matrix, the system's underlying complexity and privacy challenges present a few potential drawbacks.

At its core, Matrix functions as a distributed, partially-replicated graph database. Users interact in "rooms," which are actually directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where events like messages and user actions form an append-only history. Although this structure ensures persistent records, it also implies that data accumulation is inevitable, complicating data deletion efforts—not ideal for applications requiring privacy and confidentiality.

The append-only nature of Matrix means events can't be easily erased. When deletions are needed, users can send "redaction events" requesting other servers to wipe specific data, but these requests can be ignored. A misbehaving server could retain and potentially share this supposedly deleted information, posing privacy risks.

Spam attacks are another threat, as joining the room with numerous bots can create a complex graph, burdening servers and client systems alike—particularly in encrypted rooms. To alleviate spam, recreating a room is often necessary.

Moreover, synchronizing room history across servers introduces inconsistency. Since the system relies on causal ordering and tiebreakers that can be tampered with, different servers might display messages in varying sequences, creating discrepancies in chat history.

While Matrix offers optional end-to-end encryption, it's necessary to maintain manageable public room operations but highlights a tradeoff in privacy. Unencrypted data can spread across servers in plaintext, making careful client-level encryption essential for private conversations.

Despite these concerns, the potential of Matrix's decentralized approach and open standard still holds significant appeal. As the network continues to evolve, addressing the enumerated challenges could solidify its standing as a robust, privacy-conscious communication platform.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around **Matrix** highlights mixed sentiments, balancing its potential as a decentralized platform with persistent technical and usability concerns:

1. **Technical Challenges & Improvements**:
   - Users acknowledge efforts to improve **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** and data deletion (e.g., redaction events). However, skepticism remains around encryption fragility, unresolved bugs (e.g., "Unable to Decrypt" errors), and reliance on client compliance for security.
   - The Matrix team ("Arathorn") points to updates in 2024 addressing security, spam, and synchronization, including stricter server-client protocols and better history management. Critics argue issues like inconsistent message ordering and server trust persist.

2. **Client Ecosystem & Usability**:
   - Building reliable clients is seen as challenging, though projects using **Rust libraries** or protocols like **Simplex** (privacy-focused) receive praise. Official clients (e.g., Element) face criticism for **under-documented features** and poor user experience compared to Signal or Slack.

3. **Adoption vs. Centralization**:
   - Matrix's adoption by **European governments** (France, Germany) adds credibility but raises concerns about centralized control through large institutional deployments.
   - Alternatives like **XMPP** are suggested, though Matrix’s federated design is still favored by some for its decentralization.
