### Running GPT-2 in WebGL: Rediscovering the Lost Art of GPU Shader Programming

#### [Submission URL](https://nathan.rs/posts/gpu-shader-programming/) | 140 points | by [nathan-barry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nathan-barry) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44109257)

A few weeks ago, Pascal's project of running GPT-2 using WebGL and shaders on Hacker News sparked considerable interest and discussion among tech enthusiasts. This innovative experiment highlighted a blend of art and technology, invoking the early excitement of programmable shaders from the 2000s. Back then, NVIDIA introduced programmable shaders capable of performing complex visual effects, and soon developers realized these could be harnessed for general-purpose computations, albeit clumsily through graphics APIs like OpenGL's GLSL.

The journey from the convoluted shader languages for computing to a streamlined approach began with NVIDIA's release of CUDA in 2006. This parallel computing platform allowed developers to use C/C++ to engage GPU power without needing to juggle the complexities of a graphics API. CUDA, followed by OpenCL, heralded the era of general-purpose GPU programming, transforming GPUs into multi-core processors ideal for vast parallel computations.

Compared to graphics-specific APIs that involve a fixed pipeline emphasizing images, computing APIs like CUDA and OpenCL allowed developers to leverage GPUs directly for non-graphical computations. Gone were the days of shoehorning data into texture forms and utilizing off-screen framebuffers; now, developers could simply manage raw data with minimal overhead.

In his experiment, Pascal impressively repurposed graphics concepts—hijacking textures, and framebuffers, along with vertex and fragment shaders to run GPT-2 on a GPU. By treating textures as tensors and cleverly redirecting rendering outputs, he simulated a high-throughput data bus. This approach allowed him to store and process numerical data in a shader-based compute engine without a traditional graphics focus. Textures and Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) were adapted to serve as containers for matrix and vector data, swapped efficiently through ping-pong rendering without needing to revert to the CPU, thus optimizing performance.

Pascal's implementation is a fascinating testament to GPU programming's evolution, showcasing how vintage techniques can innovate today's machine learning workflows on consumer hardware. For those eager to dive deeper, exploring his work offers not just nostalgia, but a fresh perspective on the untapped potential of GPUs in the modern computing landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Pascal's WebGL-based GPT-2 implementation highlights technical nuances, historical context, and debates about modern GPU programming:

1. **Technical Implementation Insights**:
   - Participants dissected optimizations like using `glDrawArrays` with triangles to minimize fragment shader overhead and leveraging vertex shaders for UV coordinate generation. Techniques such as "ping-pong rendering" with FBOs (Framebuffer Objects) were noted for efficient GPU data management without CPU intervention.

2. **Historical Context**:
   - The project evoked nostalgia for early GPGPU (General-Purpose GPU) efforts, where developers repurposed graphics APIs like OpenGL for non-graphical computations before CUDA/OpenCL. Comparisons were drawn to pre-2012 machine learning workflows, such as AlexNet’s reliance on GPUs, which validated GPU training years before CUDA’s dominance.

3. **Critiques of Terminology and Accuracy**:
   - Some argued the original article mischaracterized traditional graphics APIs (e.g., OpenGL) as rigidly fixed-function, overlooking their flexibility. Debates arose over terms like "hijacking" shaders, with clarifications that fragment shaders effectively act as parallel threads, akin to CUDA kernels.

4. **WebGL vs. WebGPU**:
   - While WebGL2 lacks true compute shaders, forcing creative workarounds, participants highlighted WebGPU as the future standard for GPU computing on the web. Chrome’s slow adoption of WebGL compute shaders was criticized, with WebGPU seen as a more robust, vendor-neutral solution already supported by ~66% of browsers (per web3dsurvey data).

5. **Project Challenges**:
   - The author shared practical hurdles, such as loading model weights in browsers and adapting transformer computations to WebGL’s constraints. The GitHub repo demonstrates attention visualization and matrix operations within WebGL’s limits.

**Key Takeaway**: The project is praised as a clever, educational hack that bridges vintage GPU techniques with modern ML, while the discussion underscores the evolving landscape of web-based GPU computing and the community’s anticipation for WebGPU’s broader adoption.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html) | 128 points | by [cebert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cebert) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44105878)

While back at the 2025 re:Invent, the announcement of Aurora DSQL was an exciting moment, it was the journey and the intricate engineering decisions behind it that truly captivated the minds of industry builders. Recently, at DevCon, two senior principal engineers, Niko Matsakis and Marc Bowes, shed light on how they transitioned DSQL from being rooted in JVM to embracing Rust. With their insight, a rich exploration of the development process was born, intertwining the technical complexities and philosophical evolutions at play. 

Aurora DSQL’s story is more than just a technological upgrade; it's a testament to prioritizing engineering efficiency and a culture of questioning past successes. The authors of this inspiring narrative, alongside numerous principal engineers, highlight the importance of expertise spanning from storage to control plane engineering.

AWS's database journey since the launch of Amazon RDS in 2009 has been marked by a strategic evolution. It met increasing customer demands for variety and immediacy with purpose-built databases like DynamoDB, Redshift, and Aurora. These solutions didn't arrive overnight; they were products of iterative listening, customer collaborations, and a willingness to challenge prior assumptions. Each development tackled real production constraints, exampled by ElastiCache's inception to double output for relational databases and Neptune's emergence as graph-heavy applications grew.

The persistent challenge of creating a relational database requiring zero infrastructure management while scaling automatically remained. Aurora's past innovations like cloud-optimized storage and Aurora Serverless hinted at this future but didn’t complete it. DSQL does, by deconstructing the database into modular components with the clarity and simplicity of Unix philosophy—each doing one specific task well, together translating into the full suite of expected database features.

The tale of scaling DSQL's Journal layer from traditional approaches underscores the ingenuity involved. Instead of the typical two-phase commit (2PC) which can spiral into operational complexities, DSQL chose to write entire commits into a single journal, simplifying write path scalability while complicating reads. This radical approach required new solutions to maintain availability, latency, and operational simplicity, demonstrating once more the necessity to rethink foundational principles for innovative progress.

Aurora DSQL's development journey exemplifies the AWS ethos: a forward-looking blend of innovation rooted in customer-centric, iterative advances and disciplined engineering rigor, pushing the boundaries of what a cloud database can be.

**Summary of Discussion:**

- **Performance Gains with Rust:** The transition from JVM languages (Kotlin/Java) to Rust for Aurora DSQL led to a 10x performance boost (30k vs. 3k TPS), attributed to reduced memory footprint, I/O overhead elimination, and avoiding garbage collection. Users debated whether such rewrites are worth the effort for greenfield projects but acknowledged PostgreSQL's extensibility as a key enabler.

- **Pricing Models & Cost Certainty:** Discussions contrasted DSQL's "serverless" pricing with DynamoDB's on-demand/provisioned models. Skepticism arose around cost predictability, with some noting that true "absolute cost certainty" remains challenging depending on workload patterns.

- **Current DSQL Limitations:** Early adopters highlighted restrictions like transaction limits (e.g., 3k modified rows per transaction), missing features (views, foreign keys, JSONB, TRUNCATE), and limited PostgreSQL extension support (e.g., pg_vector). AWS engineers (e.g., mjb) clarified these are temporary, with updates actively rolling out (AWS Backup, CloudFormation, read-only views).

- **LLMs & Code Transformation:** Speculation emerged about AI/LLMs automating high-to-low-level code translation (e.g., JVM to Rust) to reduce migration costs. Skeptics pointed to technical gaps (e.g., GC vs. non-GC paradigms, OOP-to-systems language translation), though some expressed optimism for future tooling.

- **Technical Debates:** Rust's advantages (memory safety, no GC, reduced fragmentation) were contrasted with JVM tradeoffs. Users emphasized that avoiding GC in Rust directly enabled latency/throughput improvements critical for distributed systems like DSQL.

- **Architecture Insights:** Links to Marc Brooker’s blog posts were shared, detailing DSQL’s design (distributed writes, modularity, and scalability). The system’s alignment with Unix principles (simple, composable components) was praised as a core innovation.
