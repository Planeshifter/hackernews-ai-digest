#### [Submission URL](https://blog.singleton.io/posts/2022-10-17-otp-on-wrist/) | 191 points | by [alexmolas](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alexmolas) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41081435)

In an inventive twist on a classic, a tech enthusiast has transformed the iconic Casio F-91W watch into a versatile gadget that generates TOTP (Time-based One-Time Password) tokens directly on its wrist. Thanks to a new programmable logic board from the Sensor Watch project, the watch's traditional quartz movement has been replaced with an ARM Cortex M0+ brain, while retaining its original friendly interface.

This upgrade allows for seamless integration of two-factor authentication codes for popular services like Google and GitHub, providing users with quick access to their OTPs without the need for an external app. It took just an hour to swap the logic board and set up the TOTP features, alongside crafting a custom ratemeter watchface ideal for tracking rowing or cadences.

The project also offers downloadable watchfaces and utilities, including a world clock and temperature display. Even more interestingly, a WebAssembly-based emulator allows users to test and customize their watch's functionality straight from their computer. Users interested in building their own features can delve into the well-documented process, making this revival of a retro timepiece not just functional but a canvas for creativity.

Explore how the upgrade process works and get your hands on this unique blend of nostalgia and modern utility that puts digital security literally at your fingertips!

### Crooks Bypassed Google's Email Verification to Create Workspace Accounts, Acces

#### [Submission URL](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/07/crooks-bypassed-googles-email-verification-to-create-workspace-accounts-access-3rd-party-services/) | 148 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41082502)

In a recent security update, Google announced that it resolved a significant authentication flaw that allowed malicious actors to create Google Workspace accounts without proper email verification. This vulnerability enabled them to impersonate legitimate domain holders and potentially access third-party services via the “Sign in with Google” feature.

The issue came to light when users began receiving notifications about unauthorized accounts linked to their domains. According to Google, the abuse campaign began in late June, affecting "a few thousand" accounts. Google quickly fixed the loophole within 72 hours of detection and has promised stronger protections against such bypass attempts in the future. 

Senior director of abuse and safety protections, Anu Yamunan, emphasized that while the malicious accounts weren’t used to exploit Google services, they were effective in impersonating users for third-party services, with reports indicating unauthorized sign-ins on platforms like Dropbox. 

Some affected users expressed frustration over the ease of the account creation process and the lack of initial verification steps, labeling the security measures as inadequate. This incident highlights the ongoing challenges in managing online security and the critical need for robust verification protocols, especially for services with access to sensitive data.

The discussion surrounding Google's recent security flaw concerning Google Workspace accounts primarily revolves around users expressing concerns about the ease of creating accounts without proper verification, which allowed malicious actors to impersonate legitimate users. 

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **User Frustrations**: Several users criticized the initial lack of verification that enabled unauthorized account creation, with some suggesting that strict measures should have been in place to verify domains against DNS records before allowing account creation.

2. **Account Recovery Issues**: Complaints were voiced regarding the account recovery process, with some users detailing their experiences of receiving notifications from Google about accounts created under their domain. 

3. **Implications for Third-Party Services**: Users were particularly concerned about how this flaw could allow malicious accounts to gain access to third-party services, highlighting incidents involving platforms like Dropbox.

4. **Proposed Solutions**: Some participants proposed that Google and other service providers need more robust security measures, such as verification through TXT records or implementing stricter protocols for account creation with sensitive data.

5. **Security Concerns**: The broader implications of this vulnerability raised concerns about security when using single sign-on (SSO) for different service platforms, indicating that these types of systems could be exploited if not adequately secured.

Overall, the conversation underscores a significant demand for improved security protocols, particularly in the context of domain verification and safeguarding user accounts from abuse.

### Llama-3.1 supports tool calls via prompting

#### [Submission URL](https://www.braintrust.dev/docs/cookbook/recipes/LLaMa-3_1-Tools) | 21 points | by [ankrgyl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ankrgyl) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41081460)

In the world of AI, Meta's release of LLaMa 3.1 has raised some eyebrows—this latest iteration comes with impressive features like extended multilingual capabilities, a hefty context length of 128K tokens, and significantly improved reasoning skills. 

An intriguing exploration of our ability to harness LLaMa 3.1 via inference providers like Together is detailed in a recent blog post.
