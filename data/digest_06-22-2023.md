### Generating SQL with LLMs for fun and profit

#### [Submission URL](https://iamnotarobot.substack.com/p/generating-sql-with-llms-for-fun) | 63 points | by [diego](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=diego) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36440760)

Language models are being used to generate SQL code for querying databases, but this could lead to potentially dangerous situations if the generated SQL code is not thoroughly checked. As demonstrated by Diego Basch, language models can easily generate queries that alter or drop tables, and even create infinite loops. While attempts to train the model to recognize risky queries have been made, there is still a risk of prompt injection leading to SQL injection. Basch suggests making the database read-only or creating a restricted role for the language model to use as a preventive measure. However, language models should not yet be trusted to generate executable code on the fly.

Language models are being used to generate SQL code for querying databases, but there are concerns that this could potentially create dangerous situations if the generated SQL code is not thoroughly checked. The discussion on the submission suggests that language models are still not yet able to generate executable code on-the-fly and should be used with caution. There are also concerns about data security and measures to prevent unauthorized access to databases. Suggestions were made to create a read-only database or create a restricted role for the language model to use. The discussion also touched on the importance of manual tracking and overseeing the process of generating SQL code. However, solutions such as making database read-only or creating restricted access have its limitations. There is also a mention about how language models should not be trusted to generate code for production systems before being thoroughly tested. The commenters also discussed the potential dangers of prompt injection leading to SQL injections. One solution proposed was to enforce reasonable time limits and database permissions and to add security measures such as read-write security in PostgreSQL, to prevent unauthorized access to databases.

A new study by the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (EPFL) reveals that a significant portion of gig workers tasked with training AI models have been outsourcing their work to AI themselves. Researchers hired 44 people on Amazon Mechanical Turk to summarize medical research papers, and analyzed their responses using an AI model they trained themselves. They found that between 33% and 46% of workers used AI models like OpenAI’s ChatGPT. This percentage is expected to grow as AI models become more powerful and accessible. This could introduce further errors into already error-prone models and highlights the need for new ways to check whether data has been produced by humans or AI.

### Military AI’s Next Frontier: Your Work Computer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/military-ais-next-frontier-your-work-computer/) | 27 points | by [headalgorithm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=headalgorithm) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36433927)

Companies who sell surveillance services to employers, using sophisticated AI technology originally developed for intelligence and military purposes, can now be used to track their own workers. These tools, which monitor open source intelligence, reputation management and insider threat assessment, have become dramatically more sophisticated in recent years. Deep learning and new data sources have enabled employers to use advanced data analytics to identify internal leaks, labour organising and critics of the company. Many companies who sell these services tout next-generation AI technologies to identify and route out potential troublemakers across varied data sources easier through prompting, creating a semi-automatic, union-busting surveillance system.

The discussion has focused on the use of AI surveillance tools by private companies on their own employees. Some users have compared this practice to military contractor companies selling weapons or manufacturing tanks. Others have contested the accuracy of the headline's claim, noting that this kind of surveillance is generally used for typical counter-terrorism investigations and not on bankruptcy-prone companies selling questionable software. However, there is general agreement that if these technologies were originally designed for military purposes, the responsibility for their use in the private sector should fall on legislators.
