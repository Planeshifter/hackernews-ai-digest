#### [Submission URL](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/209300/when-teaching-computer-architecture-why-are-universities-using-obscure-or-even) | 87 points | by [redbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=redbell) | [100 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39996475)

In the world of Computer Architecture education, the debate rages on about why universities opt for teaching with lesser-known or even fictional CPUs like PicoBlaze or FRISC instead of industry giants like x86 or ARM. The argument is made that simpler architectures like PicoBlaze are easier for students to grasp the fundamental concepts before diving into the complexities of major architectures. The choice to use these CPUs allows for a more streamlined learning experience, focusing on the core principles without getting bogged down in the intricacies of established architectures that have evolved over decades.

The contrasting approaches present interesting perspectives on how best to introduce students to assembly language and processor design. While some advocate for starting with simpler models as a foundation, others argue that practicality should take precedence, as familiarity with mainstream architectures like x86 or ARM is essential for future programming endeavors.

Ultimately, the debate raises questions about the balance between academic purity and real-world applicability in shaping the next generation of computer scientists and engineers.
