### Making CRDTs More Efficient

#### [Submission URL](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/making-crdts-98-percent-more-efficient/) | 259 points | by [jakelazaroff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jakelazaroff) | [55 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37915934)

In the third part of his blog post series, Jake Lazaroff demonstrates how he reduces the state size of a collaborative pixel art editor that uses state-based CRDTs. The initial state size is around 648kb for a 100x100 image, but Jake aims to decrease it to around 14kb. To achieve this, he implements several optimizations. First, he changes the color representation from RGB tuples to hex codes, reducing the size by 6%. Next, he stores the UUIDs in a separate table instead of repeating them for each pixel, resulting in a 63% reduction in size. Finally, he applies the same technique to colors and creates a palette table, further reducing the size. By the end, the state size is reduced to 236kb, which is almost 98% smaller than the initial size.

The discussion on this submission revolved around different ways to further optimize the size of the state in a collaborative pixel art editor that uses state-based CRDTs. Some commenters suggested alternative compression techniques, such as implementing RLE-based compression or using general-purpose compressors like zstd. Others mentioned the possibility of using different data representations, like JSON or BSON, and the potential benefits of using faster UUID generation methods. The discussion also touched on the trade-offs between storing UUIDs and integers and the effectiveness of integer compression techniques. Some commenters recommended exploring advanced compression techniques like FastPFOR or Roaring Bitmaps. Overall, the conversation highlighted different perspectives on optimizing the state size and offered additional suggestions for further improvement.

### Interviews in the Age of AI: Ditch Leetcode â Try Code Reviews Instead

#### [Submission URL](https://chrlschn.dev/blog/2023/07/interviews-age-of-ai-ditch-leetcode-try-code-reviews-instead/) | 182 points | by [CharlieDigital](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlieDigital) | [263 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37913506)

In a recent Medium article titled "Interviews in the Age of AI: Ditch Leetcode - Try Code Reviews Instead," Charles Chen argues that traditional coding exercises, such as those found on Leetcode, may not be the best way to evaluate software engineering candidates. Chen believes that code reviews offer a more realistic and insightful evaluation process. 

Chen points out that most developers don't spend their coding time on algorithmically complex problems. Instead, they rely on resources like StackOverflow, documentation, and online tools for assistance. Additionally, developers often work in isolation and without time constraints, which is unlike high-stakes coding interviews. 

By shifting the focus to code reviews, Chen believes that teams can evaluate a candidate's ability to read and understand code, identify defects, provide quality feedback, and collaborate effectively. Code reviews also provide a more accurate picture of how a candidate would fit into a team and their depth of experience. Moreover, code reviews are not easily "cheatable" through AI-generated code or studying for specific problems. 

Chen suggests several strategies for implementing code reviews in the interview process, such as using relevant parts of an existing codebase or real problems the team has been working on. Overall, he emphasizes that code reviews offer a more comprehensive and practical evaluation of technical candidates.

The discussion surrounding the submission revolves around the topic of background checks during the hiring process. Some commenters express concerns about the legal implications and privacy concerns of conducting background checks. Others share their experiences with background checks and the different practices they have encountered, highlighting the variations in different regions and industries.

The conversation also touches on the idea of showcasing personal projects during interviews as an alternative evaluation method. Some commenters argue that personal projects can be a good indicator of a candidate's skills and commitment, while others caution that not all candidates have the resources or time to work on personal projects.

There is also a discussion about the use of code reviews as a better evaluation method for software engineering candidates compared to traditional coding exercises. Commenters agree that code reviews offer a more realistic evaluation of a candidate's abilities, as they focus on reading and understanding code, providing feedback, and collaborating effectively. Some commenters share their positive experiences with implementing code reviews in their hiring process.

Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of finding alternative evaluation methods that provide a more comprehensive and practical view of a candidate's skills and fit within a team. Background checks and code reviews are explored as potential solutions to this challenge.

### An AI Which Imitates Humans Can Beat Humans

#### [Submission URL](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation.html) | 17 points | by [laurex](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=laurex) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37908597)

In a recent blog post, the author discusses whether AI systems trained to imitate human behaviors can eventually surpass human capabilities. The author explores five mechanisms through which imitative AI could potentially outperform humans. 

The first mechanism is noise. Different humans have different answers to the same question, so if an AI model can consistently provide the average answer, it would outperform the average human. 

The second mechanism is specialization. Humans tend to write about what they know, so an AI model that learns to predict typical answers to specific questions could sound like a specialist in various areas. It could answer questions about water like a hydrologist and questions about bugs like an entomologist. 

The third mechanism is interpolation. AI models can interpolate responses from different humans, which can be functionally equivalent to inference. This means that AI models may be able to answer questions that no human can answer reliably. 

The fourth mechanism is priors. If an AI model has different priors than a human, it could uncover hidden structures that humans are unaware of. For example, an AI model trained on human observations of astronomical events could potentially discover cycles in those events and make more accurate predictions than humans. 

The fifth mechanism is tacit knowledge. Most human knowledge is tacit, meaning it is used in forming judgments without conscious awareness. If AI models can accurately predict human judgments, then the weights in those models effectively contain that tacit knowledge. These models can be re-engineered to use that knowledge in ways that humans cannot. 

Although the author provides a theoretical framework for these mechanisms, there is limited evidence of superhuman performance by AI systems. Many benchmarks used to evaluate machine learning models have human labels as the ground truth, making it difficult to determine when computers surpass humans. 

The blog post includes a graphical argument illustrating the five mechanisms and a deeper discussion of each mechanism. It also explores the AI-human gap in various tasks, discusses applications and related literature, and presents a simple formal model derived from the five mechanisms.

The discussion on this submission includes a comment from "hltst" who references articles that discuss the increasing accuracy of AI models in solving mathematical problems. They mention that the accuracy remains relatively low compared to human norms, and increasing the model parameters does not necessarily improve mathematical reasoning.

In response, "K0balt" makes a sarcastic comment, saying they can't help but smirk at highly intelligent computers struggling with fundamental math.

There is another comment from "mchlhny" who adds that the content mentioned in the submission is also available on a GitHub page.

Overall, the discussion seems to revolve around the limitations of AI models in terms of mathematical reasoning and the availability of additional content related to the submission.
