In the third part of his blog post series, Jake Lazaroff demonstrates how he reduces the state size of a collaborative pixel art editor that uses state-based CRDTs. The initial state size is around 648kb for a 100x100 image, but Jake aims to decrease it to around 14kb. To achieve this, he implements several optimizations. First, he changes the color representation from RGB tuples to hex codes, reducing the size by 6%. Next, he stores the UUIDs in a separate table instead of repeating them for each pixel, resulting in a 63% reduction in size. Finally, he applies the same technique to colors and creates a palette table, further reducing the size. By the end, the state size is reduced to 236kb, which is almost 98% smaller than the initial size.

### An AI Which Imitates Humans Can Beat Humans

#### [Submission URL](https://tecunningham.github.io/posts/2023-09-05-model-of-ai-imitation.html) | 17 points | by [laurex](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=laurex) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37908597)

In a recent blog post, the author discusses whether AI systems trained to imitate human behaviors can eventually surpass human capabilities. The author explores five mechanisms through which imitative AI could potentially outperform humans. The first mechanism is noise. Different humans have different answers to the same question, so if an AI model can consistently provide the average answer, it would outperform the average human. The second mechanism is specialization. Humans tend to write about what they know, so an AI model that learns to predict typical answers to specific questions could sound like a specialist in various areas. It could answer questions about water like a hydrologist and questions about bugs like an entomologist. The third mechanism is interpolation. AI models can interpolate responses from different humans, which can be functionally equivalent to inference. This means that AI models may be able to answer questions that no human can answer reliably. The fourth mechanism is priors. If an AI model has different priors than a human, it could uncover hidden structures that humans are unaware of. For example, an AI model trained on human observations of astronomical events could potentially discover cycles in those events and make more accurate predictions than humans. The fifth mechanism is tacit knowledge. Most human knowledge is tacit, meaning it is used in forming judgments without conscious awareness. If AI models can accurately predict human judgments, then the weights in those models effectively contain that tacit knowledge. These models can be re-engineered to use that knowledge in ways that humans cannot. 

Although the author provides a theoretical framework for these mechanisms, there is limited evidence of superhuman performance by AI systems. Many benchmarks used to evaluate machine learning models have human labels as the ground truth, making it difficult to determine when computers surpass humans. The blog post includes a graphical argument illustrating the five mechanisms and a deeper discussion of each mechanism. It also explores the AI-human gap in various tasks, discusses applications and related literature, and presents a simple formal model derived from the five mechanisms.

The discussion on this submission includes a comment from "hltst" who references articles that discuss the increasing accuracy of AI models in solving mathematical problems. They mention that the accuracy remains relatively low compared to human norms, and increasing the model parameters does not necessarily improve mathematical reasoning. In response, "K0balt" makes a sarcastic comment, saying they can't help but smirk at highly intelligent computers struggling with fundamental math. There is another comment from "mchlhny" who adds that the content mentioned in the submission is also available on a GitHub page. Overall, the discussion seems to revolve around the limitations of AI models in terms of mathematical reasoning and the availability of additional content related to the submission.
