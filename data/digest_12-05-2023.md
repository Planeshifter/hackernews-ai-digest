The latest Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) will be available on select Android 14 devices, offering new capabilities for platform developers. AVF makes virtual machines a core construct of the Android operating system, similar to Linux processes. Developers can choose between one-way isolation, where Android controls the contents of the VM, and two-way isolation, where Android and the VM are completely isolated from each other. AVF offers benefits such as portability, performance, and extensibility, allowing developers to build applications once and deploy them everywhere. It also brings the power of virtualization to Android, enabling virtual desktops, sandboxing, and more. AVF's use of isolated virtual machines can benefit common Android use cases like biometrics and DRM. AVF provides easy APIs to query device capabilities and set up secure communication channels with virtual machines. The AVF consists of the framework APIs, the hypervisor (pKVM), and the Virtual Machine Manager (crosvm). AVF is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and flexible, making it a valuable tool for Android app and game developers. [Link to article]

to limit or prohibit them. Mass surveillance has already changed the nature of surveillance by allowing backward tracking and targeting without specific individuals in mind. Now, with the help of AI, we are about to enter the era of mass spying. AI systems can summarize and organize vast amounts of data, making it easier to search and understand in bulk. This will enable the tracking of topics, conversations, organizational structures, confidants, friendships, alliances, and much more. Microphones everywhere, like Siri and Alexa, have the potential to fuel mass spying, as conversations are constantly being monitored. Governments, corporations, and tech monopolies will engage in mass spying, as it opens up new avenues for social control and marketing opportunities. While we could limit this capability through data-privacy rules, the reality is that mass surveillance has not been limited, so spying is unlikely to be different.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the topic of mass surveillance and its potential consequences. Some commenters argue that mass surveillance is a political problem, and implementing restrictions through data privacy rules may not be effective since mass surveillance has not been limited in the past. They also note that technological advancements, such as AI, make mass spying easier and more powerful. Others highlight the parallel between the surveillance of individuals during the Cold War and the potential for mass spying with the help of AI. Some commenters suggest sousveillance as a solution, where individuals actively monitor those in power. The cost factor and the visibility of AI surveillance are also discussed, with one commenter mentioning the shift from human surveillance to AI surveillance through personal devices like phones and smart devices. 

The discussion delves into the concept of dystopian nightmares and the power dynamics at play in mass surveillance. Some commenters express concern about the misuse of power by governments or intelligence agencies, while others argue that surveillance can have good intentions and is not inherently dystopian. The importance of distinguishing between surveillance and spying is highlighted, with one commenter noting that surveillance can be justified for security purposes, while spying is ethically questionable.

The conversation also touches on the intersection of technology, policy decisions, and political motivations. Some commenters argue that policy decisions are often driven by practicality and cost, rather than ethical considerations. The potential capabilities of AI and the cost-effectiveness of AI models are discussed, with examples given of AI-powered technologies already in use. 

The discussion concludes with contrasting viewpoints on the relationship between privacy and public services. Some commenters argue that restricting mass surveillance is vital to protect privacy and prevent discrimination, while others argue that providing public services requires sharing certain information and that discrimination based on that information is illegal. The conversation ends with a comment noting that the initial article did not touch on the issue of political repression and its impact on society.
