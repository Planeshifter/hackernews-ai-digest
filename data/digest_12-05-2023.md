The latest Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) will be available on select Android 14 devices, offering new capabilities for platform developers. AVF makes virtual machines a core construct of the Android operating system, similar to Linux processes. Developers can choose between one-way isolation, where Android controls the contents of the VM, and two-way isolation, where Android and the VM are completely isolated from each other. AVF offers benefits such as portability, performance, and extensibility, allowing developers to build applications once and deploy them everywhere. It also brings the power of virtualization to Android, enabling virtual desktops, sandboxing, and more. AVF's use of isolated virtual machines can benefit common Android use cases like biometrics and DRM. AVF provides easy APIs to query device capabilities and set up secure communication channels with virtual machines. The AVF consists of the framework APIs, the hypervisor (pKVM), and the Virtual Machine Manager (crosvm). AVF is designed to be lightweight, efficient, and flexible, making it a valuable tool for Android app and game developers. [Link to article]

### Sequential modeling enables scalable learning for  large vision models

#### [Submission URL](https://yutongbai.com/lvm.html) | 130 points | by [og_kalu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=og_kalu) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38530948)

Researchers from UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University have introduced a novel approach to learning Large Vision Models (LVM) without relying on linguistic data. They define a common format called "visual sentences" to represent raw images and videos, as well as annotated data sources like semantic segmentations and depth reconstructions. By representing visual data as sequences and training the model to predict the next token, they demonstrate that LVMs can scale effectively across various model architectures and data diversity. The researchers also show that larger LVMs perform better on downstream tasks and provide examples of prompts for tasks like frame predictions, in and out of distribution prompting, compositing, novel tasks, and non-verbal IQ tests.

The discussion around the submission covers a range of topics related to large vision models and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Some users compare the approach to other models like General Pattern Machines and DeepMind's Gato, while others discuss the potential applications of large language models in manipulating visual data. The concept of AGI and its definition is also debated, with some users arguing that machines cannot possess true general intelligence. The topic of captchas and their effectiveness in distinguishing humans from AI is also raised, with some questioning the ethical implications of using captchas. Overall, there is a mixture of technical analysis, speculation, and philosophical debate in the discussion.

Ofcom, the UK's communications regulator, has proposed that explicit websites use facial recognition technology to scan users' faces and verify their age, particularly for young-looking adults. This draft guidance aims to prevent children from accessing pornography online, as a recent survey suggests that the average age children view explicit material is 13. While some young adults involved in sex education think these measures could be helpful, privacy campaigners have criticized the proposals, warning of potential catastrophic consequences if age verification data is leaked. Websites could also use other methods, such as checking government ID or credit card information, as well as digital ID wallets to store proof of age. Ofcom expects firms to be "highly effective" in complying with these regulations, which will come into force in 2025.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various topics such as government surveillance, control over personal data, the role of religion, and concerns about authoritarianism. Some commenters express skepticism about the government's interest in citizens' sex lives, while others argue for the importance of protecting children from accessing explicit content. There are debates about the effectiveness of age verification technology and alternative methods of preventing children from accessing explicit websites. Privacy concerns are raised regarding the potential leakage of age verification data. The discussion also touches upon issues like religious laws, parental responsibility, and the role of small businesses in countering government surveillance. Some commenters bring up the Second Amendment and its implications in the United States. Overall, the discussion highlights differing opinions on government intervention, privacy rights, and censorship.
