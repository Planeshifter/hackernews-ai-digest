### Origin of 'Daemon' in Computing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.takeourword.com/TOW146/page4.html) | 224 points | by [wizerno](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wizerno) | [98 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41891953)

In a fascinating email exchange, Professor Fernando J. Corbato clarifies the true origin of the word "daemon" in computing—a term he and his team popularized in the 1960s at Project MAC. Contrary to common belief that "daemon" stands for "Disk And Executive MONitor," Corbato explains that the term actually draws inspiration from "Maxwell's daemon," a thought experiment from physics conceptualized by James Clerk Maxwell. This fictional creature, tasked with sorting gas molecules based on speed, parallels how computer daemons work tirelessly in the background to manage system tasks.

Corbato's insights not only shed light on this terminology's origins but also highlight a common misconception regarding its etymology—reminding us that "daemon" distinctly embodies a more neutral or even positive connotation, unlike its malevolent counterpart, "demon." Through the meticulous exploration of language and its evolution, the discussion serves as a fascinating reminder of how scientific concepts can influence tech jargon. This blend of etymology and computing history underscores the creativity inherent in language while detailing how our understanding of technology is shaped by its linguistic past.

In the discussion surrounding Professor Fernando J. Corbato's clarification of the term "daemon" in computing, a diverse array of comments emerged, showcasing both humor and confusion. Several users referenced various interpretations of the term, humorously juxtaposing it with themes of death and zombies, reflecting a playful take on computing terminology. 

Key comments included jokes about "killing" processes, dark humor regarding children and zombies, and nods to command line practices in UNIX-like systems. Some participants expressed admiration for the historical and scientific connections, emphasizing the relevance of Maxwell's thought experiment. Others shared personal anecdotes related to past experiences with various systems where they encountered the term "daemon," reflecting its longstanding presence in computing culture.

Several users delved into etymological discussions, clarifying their understanding of the distinction between "daemon" and "demon," while some pointed out the historical use of terms in the context of system messaging and process management. The conversation also touched on broader themes of language evolution within technology, statistics, and even surprise at the ongoing relevance of Corbato's insights. 

Overall, the discussion blended humor, technical jargon, and reflections on language, revealing a community engaged in both lighthearted and serious examination of computing history and its linguistic nuances.

### Machine conquest: Jules Verne's technocratic worldmaking

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/machine-conquest-jules-vernes-technocratic-worldmaking/E5897EB8F3FB9A8F0142075EE38D69BC) | 59 points | by [johntfella](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johntfella) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41894025)

In a thought-provoking article published in the *Review of International Studies*, researcher Jan Eijking explores the intricate ways in which Jules Verne’s literary work acts as a blueprint for technocratic worldmaking during the 19th century. Titled "Machine Conquest: Jules Verne’s Technocratic Worldmaking," the article highlights how Verne's *Extraordinary Voyages* series conjures a vision of global order that is driven by elite technocrats rather than traditional political entities.

Eijking argues that Verne’s narratives reflect a complex relationship with colonialism, showing how the writer's fictional adventures provided a framework that justified imperial expansion, particularly among contemporary explorers and colonial figures. By examining Verne’s portrayal of fully autonomous technocrats and their often violent methods, the article suggests that he crafted a unique perspective on global governance that resonates even today, particularly in discussions around techno-colonial projects like space colonization.

The analysis not only sheds light on Verne's ambivalent stance toward colonization—balancing romanticism with critique—but also encourages readers to reconsider the role of speculative fiction in shaping international thought and policy. Through this lens, Eijking's work elevates Verne from a mere adventure storyteller to a pivotal figure in the discourse of international relations and technocratic ideology.

In the discussion surrounding Jan Eijking's article on Jules Verne, various commenters engage in a nuanced examination of the themes presented by Eijking. The conversation highlights aspects of Verne's work related to technocracy, imperialism, and global narratives.

- **Jules Verne and Technocratic Ideology**: Commenters emphasize Verne's portrayal of technocrats as pivotal figures in shaping global governance. They discuss how Verne's characters often operate independently of traditional political structures, reflecting a preference for elite, private governance.

- **Colonialism and Adventure**: There is a recognition of the complex relationship between Verne's narratives and colonialism. Some commenters note how Verne's writings can be interpreted as justifying imperial expansion, while others highlight his ambivalent stance, suggesting he critiques colonial practices even as he embodies some aspects of them.

- **Speculative Fiction’s Role**: Commenters agree on the importance of speculative fiction in influencing political and international discourse. Eijking's assertion that Verne’s stories help readers understand modern global issues sparked discussions about the historical implications of narrative in shaping policies.

- **Contemporary Relevance**: The reflections on Verne's work also lead to discussions about contemporary parallels, particularly around topics such as space colonization and the influence of corporate governments on modern political structures.

Overall, the discussion reveals an appreciation for Verne's literary contributions while critiquing the colonial undertones of his narratives, inviting new interpretations that resonate with today's global and technocratic challenges.
