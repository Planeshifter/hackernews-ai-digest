The hidden labor behind artificial intelligence (AI) is brought to light in a recent feature by The Verge. The article focuses on a Remotasks office in Nairobi which is a subsidiary of Scale AI, where workers perform annotation tasks to improve AI algorithms. These tasks range from identifying human or robotic voices in audio clips to rating the sexual provocation of online ads. The article highlights the reliance of generative AI on human labor and the low wages that workers in this field often receive. The similarities between AI annotation work and moderation contractors—who clean up platforms like Facebook and YouTube—are noted, as many of these companies operate in both areas. The article discusses the industry of business process outsourcing (BPO), which includes call centers and various types of work. While annotation work may not be traumatic like moderation, the lack of better pay and visibility for workers remains a concern.

Tesla's valuation of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package appears to be inconsistent, with the company valuing it high when it's convenient and lower for trade-ins. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has previously claimed that vehicles equipped with the FSD package would be "appreciating assets" as the package improved through software updates. However, trade-in estimates for Tesla vehicles with the FSD package seem to be lower than the package's actual price. This has led to frustration among Tesla owners who feel that their FSD package is being devalued, despite Tesla not delivering on its promises of full autonomy. Some users have suggested that Tesla should allow the transfer of the FSD software to new vehicles to incentivize current owners to upgrade. This would help increase sales and create goodwill around the FSD package.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission revolves around frustration with Tesla's valuation and handling of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) package. Some users express frustration with Elon Musk's claims about the FSD package being an appreciating asset despite the package not delivering on its promises of full autonomy. Others suggest that allowing the transfer of the FSD software to new vehicles would incentivize current owners to upgrade, increase sales, and create goodwill. Some users argue that Tesla doesn't value the FSD package highly because it isn't willing to help sales by creating goodwill around it. There is also mention of the frustration over not being able to trade-in software and the misunderstanding that Tesla doesn't allow it, with clarification that it's about not being able to transfer the software to third-party buyers. The discussion also touches on skepticism about Musk's claims and connects it to potential stock market dynamics. Overall, the discussion highlights concerns and dissatisfaction with Tesla's valuation and handling of the FSD package.

### Self-driving cars are surveillance cameras on wheels

#### [Submission URL](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2023/07/self-driving-cars-are-surveillance-cameras-on-wheels.html) | 261 points | by [activiation](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=activiation) | [270 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36572401)

Self-driving cars may be convenient for commuting, but they're also becoming a new tool for law enforcement surveillance. Police are increasingly using footage from self-driving cars as video evidence in criminal investigations. While security cameras are already common in cities, self-driving cars offer a new level of access and coverage. They capture a wider range of footage as they navigate the city, making it easier for law enforcement to turn to one company with a large repository of videos instead of reaching out to multiple businesses with their own security systems. However, this raises concerns about privacy and the erosion of personal freedom. Advocates argue that individuals should be able to go about their daily lives without constant surveillance, unless they are suspected of a crime. As self-driving cars become more prevalent, it's likely that video evidence will play a larger role in criminal cases.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the topic of self-driving cars and their use in law enforcement surveillance. Some users express concerns about the erosion of privacy and personal freedom, while others argue that video evidence from self-driving cars can be helpful in criminal investigations. There is also a discussion about the limitations and potential abuses of surveillance systems, as well as the role of speed cameras and the impact of government-owned cameras. Additionally, there are debates about the importance of privacy and the potential benefits and drawbacks of data collection by connected cars. Some users highlight the need for regulation and accountability in the use of surveillance technology.

### Valve responds to claims it has banned AI-generated games from Steam

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/03/valve-responds-to-claims-it-has-banned-ai-generated-games-from-steam/) | 23 points | by [lsllc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lsllc) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36580344)

Valve, the developer of the Half-Life series and operator of the Steam games store, has clarified its policy on games with AI-generated assets. This comes after rumors spread that Valve was rejecting games utilizing AI-generated content. The company stated that its policy is not a stand against AI, but rather an evolving approach to content approval. Valve's rules on content can be unclear until developers test them with unique cases. One developer had their game rejected due to having AI-generated assets that potentially infringed on intellectual property rights. Valve cited unclear legal ownership of such assets as the reason for rejecting the game. The use of AI as a game development tool is not controversial, with major developers like Ubisoft embracing the technology. However, the issue arises when AI-generated content involves unpaid artists. It remains unclear who bears liability for the generated art. Valve clarified that its review process is based on current copyright laws, not personal opinion. In cases where this policy decision influences game rejection, Valve will refund the app submission fee. While some developers may utilize AI-generated content for quick profits, as the use of AI tools becomes more widespread and sophisticated, the matter becomes less straightforward.

The discussion on the submission primarily revolves around the implications of using AI-generated assets in games and the legal and ethical challenges associated with it. Some users express concerns about the potential low quality and lack of originality in AI-generated content, suggesting that it may lead to an influx of low-quality games on platforms like Steam. Others raise issues of copyright infringement and the difficulty in determining ownership of AI-generated assets.  There is also a discussion about the regulations and policies surrounding AI-generated games. Some users reference Google's policies regarding AI-generated content and the potential legal battles that could arise from such regulations. One user argues that AI-generated assets should be allowed under Creative Commons licenses, while another highlights the challenges posed by AI-generated textures and the need for greater compensation for content creators. One user brings up the topic of attributing AI-generated content, noting that it can be challenging to trace the original source of such content. Another user argues that using AI for content generation is similar to using tools like Photoshop and should be seen in the same light. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex legal, ethical, and quality-related considerations surrounding AI-generated assets in games.
