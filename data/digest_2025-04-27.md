### Do Large Language Models know who did what to whom?

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16884) | 34 points | by [badmonster](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=badmonster) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43813879)

In a fascinating new study titled "Do Large Language Models Know Who Did What to Whom?" researchers Joseph M. Denning and his colleagues delve into the intricacies of language understanding by large language models (LLMs). The paper addresses the ongoing debate about whether LLMs truly "understand" language or merely process it. The authors focus specifically on a fundamental linguistic concept: thematic roles, which involve determining the agent and patient in a sentence—essentially, "who did what to whom."

The team conducted experiments on four different LLMs to analyze how well they capture these thematic roles. Surprisingly, they discovered that while humans tend to link sentence similarity to thematic roles, these models predominantly associate similarity with syntax alone, often overlooking thematic structures. Interestingly, some attention mechanisms within the models did manage to isolate thematic roles, suggesting that LLMs possess a latent ability to understand such language constructs, albeit less consistently than humans.

The paper provides significant insights into how LLMs construct "meaning" and highlights the nuanced differences in language understanding between artificial and human cognition. If you're intrigued by the intersection of computational language models and cognitive science, this study offers a rich exploration of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs regarding sentence comprehension. For further details, you can access the full paper via arXiv [doi:10.48550/arXiv.2504.16884](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16884).

**Discussion Summary:**

1. **User 112233** questions whether LLMs truly understand narrative roles ("who did what to whom") or merely mimic patterns. They suggest models might superficially swap characters (e.g., agents and patients) while relying on syntactic structures rather than deeper thematic understanding. A reply by **NoToP** provides an example involving air traffic control transcripts, where a character’s role (e.g., "Y talking to traffic control") highlights potential inconsistencies in how models handle agent-patient assignments.

2. **bdmnstr** shares a direct link to the arXiv paper for reference.

3. **kzntr** argues that LLMs excel at preserving meaning in tasks like translation, implying syntactic competence. **chwxy** elaborates by summarizing the study’s key findings:
   - **Experiment 1**: LLMs prioritize syntax over thematic roles when assessing sentence similarity, unlike humans, who focus on meaning.
   - **Experiment 2**: Thematic role information is faintly detectable in some hidden layers and attention heads, enabling limited classification of sentences by roles. However, this capability is inconsistent and generally inferior to human performance, except in specific descriptive cases where attention heads surprisingly outperformed humans.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion underscores skepticism about LLMs’ grasp of thematic roles, emphasizing their syntactic bias. While some attention mechanisms show latent potential for role-based understanding, humans remain more robust at integrating meaning and context.

### AI Coding assistants provide little value because a programmer's job is to think

#### [Submission URL](https://www.doliver.org/articles/programming-is-a-thinkers-game) | 98 points | by [d0liver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=d0liver) | [183 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43815033)

In a recent critique, a developer highlights the gap between written code and the actual running programs, using a JavaScript example to drive home the point. This particular code snippet raises several issues about execution context, dependency on external functions, and the implicit nature of many JavaScript actions. The main argument is that while code may appear functional, many underlying complexities exist that aren't visible in the code itself. These include understanding browser behaviors, version compatibility, and the setup of event-driven programming, all of which require significant human reasoning.

The article further critiques the notion of AI-driven code generation, suggesting that these tools often churn out syntactically correct but logically flawed snippets. Since AI lacks deep understanding and reasoning capabilities, it tends to create code that might look right but falls short in practice, especially for non-trivial tasks. The complexity of integrating AI-generated code into real-world applications, needing human verification and corrections, often outweighs any time savings from automated generation.

Moreover, the article argues that successful software engineering is less about the act of writing code and more about understanding, discussing, and filling in the gaps that machine-generated code cannot acknowledge. Established modules, open source projects, and community-generated example codes remain invaluable assets because they provide context, documentation, and thoughtful abstractions necessary for high-quality software development.

In conclusion, the piece echoes the sentiment of Linux creator Linus Torvalds: real programming challenges require a deep understanding of the system, beyond the mere ability to write code. Debuggers, modules, and community resources help programmers focus on "the meaning of things," rather than the minutiae, ultimately elevating their craft above simple code generation.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the limitations and challenges of AI-generated code, centering on its inability to fully grasp context, dependencies, and domain-specific complexities. Key themes include:  

1. **AI as a Time-Saver, Not a Silver Bullet**:  
   - Many users report using LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT) for boilerplate code, bug fixes, or repetitive tasks, saving hours of work. However, results often require significant human intervention for edge cases, debugging, and refining.

2. **Contextual Understanding Falls Short**:  
   - AI struggles with deep technical reasoning, such as understanding low-level system interactions (e.g., JSON parsing, configuration files) or niche frameworks/tools (e.g., Zig, Zephyr RTOS). Users highlight failures when AI lacks access to indexed documentation or misinterprats implicit project requirements.

3. **Testing and Code Quality**:  
   - While AI can generate code quickly, users emphasize the importance of rigorous testing. Tests written by humans (or explicitly guided by humans) are critical for ensuring robustness, as AI-generated tests may miss edge cases or produce misleading coverage metrics.

4. **Domain Complexity and Specialization**:  
   - In complex domains like finance, embedded systems, or legacy codebases, AI often falters. One developer notes how AI failed to handle C++ data structures or Qt UI intricacies, requiring manual problem-solving despite prompts.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**:  
   - Developers stress that AI tools are most effective when paired with human expertise. For example, AI might propose a fix, but developers must verify it and fill in gaps through deeper technical analysis. Over-reliance leads to "code monkeys pasting LLM output" without true understanding.

6. **Mixed Success in Workflows**:  
   - Some praise LLMs for accelerating tasks like CSV imports or React/Vue conversions, while others find them inadequate for bespoke projects lacking clear documentation. The consensus: AI aids productivity but cannot replace critical thinking or domain knowledge.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores that AI tools are valuable for accelerating repetitive or well-trodden tasks but falter in nuanced, highly specialized, or poorly documented scenarios. Human oversight, domain expertise, and rigorous testing remain indispensable for high-quality software development.
