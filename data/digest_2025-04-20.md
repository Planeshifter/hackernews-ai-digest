In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, our understanding and measurement of AI's intelligence, creativity, or empathy remain murky, as highlighted by Ethan Mollick in his exploration of AGI—or Artificial General Intelligence. Traditional benchmarks like the Turing Test, initially designed as theoretical challenges, now serve as questionable indicators of AI capabilities in an era where such tasks are increasingly surmountable by machines.

Mollick notes that AGI’s definition is fraught with controversy, tangled in debates about the scope and nature of tasks required for AI to achieve human-level performance. Enter the latest advancements in AI models, such as OpenAI’s "o3" and Google's "Gemini 2.5 Pro," which significantly push benchmark boundaries and showcase remarkable agentic abilities, allowing them to perform complex tasks autonomously.

A notable experiment saw "o3" executing a series of challenging instructions—from crafting marketing slogans to building a mock-up website—all in under two minutes. This demonstrates its potential as a "Reasoner," showcasing evolved capabilities reminiscent of AGI, yet these breakthroughs beg the question of what exactly constitutes true artificial general intelligence.

Mollick’s term "Jagged Frontier" captures the unsettling and unpredictable nature of AI's progress—it’s impressively advanced yet remains inconsistent across different applications. He suggests that to truly grasp AGI’s potential, one must personally engage with these models, possibly “feeling the AGI” through tailored interactions.

This ongoing experiment with AI-generated discussions, research, and applications underscores the technology's enormous potential—and its equally vast uncertainties—highlighting the vital need for adaptable benchmarks in gauging AI’s evolution.

Enthusiastic tech historians and retro computing fans will be delighted by the latest adventure in resurrecting forgotten computing eras! A bold retrocomputing developer has tackled the challenging task of equipping the DEC Professional 380, a notoriously incompatible member of the PDP-11 family, with its own bespoke TCP/IP stack. This ambitious project is inspired by the nostalgia of days when the Commodore 64 and similar systems ruled the geek world—days when building compatibility often required ingenuity and a good deal of stubbornness.

With the help of AI and decades of collective networking wisdom, the developer has crafted a barely adequate, pre-C89 TCP/IP stack using Slirp-CK to allow the Pro 380, running a System V Unix variant called PRO/VENIX V2.0, to engage with the modern web—even as far as downloading the Google homepage in all its glory over a SLIP connection. This venture not only revives the bygone era when Digital Equipment Corporation was experimenting with desktop PDP-11s, it also bestows new life into an architecture that was initially tailored to avoid cannibalizing DEC’s own product lines, only to become a distinct oddity amid the computer revolution in the early '80s.

What’s remarkable is the project's back-to-future nature, drawing from the intricate web of Unix iterations and fractured digital history. Developers of that time, such as the VenturCom crew led by Myron Zimmerman, were among the pioneering Unix licensees, eager to capitalize on the nascent Unix market.

What's particularly engaging about this endeavor is not just the technical hurdle it overcomes, but its invitation to learn from history—recalling how DEC's vision of a unified desktop-and-minicomputer line diverged into a spontaneously incompatible reality. In fact, their ambition to rival IBM’s PC success inadvertently fueled a resurgence in niche computer archaeology. This juxtaposition of past and present computing challenges is not merely an exercise in nostalgia but a testament to the enduring spirit of innovation where old machines—and their modern allies—find new ways to converse in our connected world.

### To Make Language Models Work Better, Researchers Sidestep Language

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-language-models-work-better-researchers-sidestep-language-20250414/) | 24 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744809)

In Anil Ananthaswamy's recent article for Quanta Magazine, researchers are exploring new ways to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by sidestepping their reliance on language. Traditionally, LLMs, like those using transformers, process information by translating mathematical representations into words. This requirement to verbalize concepts can slow down processing and lead to potential information loss.

The core of an LLM's function occurs in a mathematical realm known as "latent space," where complex number sequences are manipulated to understand and generate text. However, translating these numerical computations into words demands extra computational resources and can act as a bottleneck, limiting the model's efficiency.

Two recent studies, highlighted by Mike Knoop and Luke Zettlemoyer, point towards innovative LLM architectures that allow models to maintain thought processes within latent space more extensively before producing text. This method has shown potential for both increased efficiency and improved reasoning capabilities.

In essence, these advancements seek to minimize the frequent conversions between latent computations and language expressions, a process that often involves creating a "chain of thought" or a token sequence mimicking thought processes. By allowing more reasoning to remain within the mathematical domain, researchers like Shibo Hao at the University of California, San Diego, are paving the way for a new era of AI—one less constrained by verbalization hurdles, potentially transforming the landscape of natural language processing.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the inefficiency of traditional LLMs compared to human reasoning and explores technical alternatives to mitigate these issues. Key points include:

1. **Human vs. LLM Reasoning**:  
   Humans solve problems through relatively simple, iterative reasoning steps, while LLMs require billions of parameters to mimic even basic reasoning. This highlights a gap in efficiency and elegance between biological and artificial intelligence.

2. **Chain of Thought Limitations**:  
   The "chain of thought" approach, which converts internal reasoning into tokenized outputs, risks information loss due to frequent translations between latent computations and language. This bottleneck underscores the need for alternative architectures.

3. **Latent Space Retention with Recurrent Networks**:  
   Recurrent networks are proposed as a way to keep reasoning within the mathematical "latent space" longer, reducing reliance on token generation. This aligns with research aiming to enhance LLMs by minimizing lossy conversions to text.

4. **Flow Matching & Iterative Processes**:  
   The discussion highlights "flow matching," an iterative method likened to solving differential equations step-by-step. Instead of generating tokens at each step, models update latent vectors incrementally (e.g., predicting 𝑥₀, an initial state, directly). This approach mirrors how recurrent networks process sequences and could streamline reasoning by avoiding intermediate verbalizations.

5. **Transformers in Latent Space**:  
   Techniques like integrating Gaussian noise into transformers’ latent space processing are mentioned. This allows models to predict outcomes (e.g., 𝑥₀) directly within the latent domain, bypassing repetitive token generation and improving computational efficiency.

**Takeaway**: The conversation emphasizes the potential of recurrent architectures and latent-space-focused methods (like flow matching) to enhance LLM efficiency and reasoning by reducing dependency on text-based intermediate steps, drawing parallels to both mathematical problem-solving and human cognition.
