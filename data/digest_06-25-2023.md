Privacy4Cars released a new tool called the Vehicle Privacy Report that reveals how much information car manufacturers can collect from your vehicle's data. The tool creates privacy labels for what manufacturers collect and whom they share data with. Typically, most modern vehicles are like "smartphones on wheels," with the ability to collect significant amounts of data wirelessly and send the information to manufacturers. The Vehicle Privacy Report works by using a car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and analyzing each manufacturer's public policy documents. The study showed Toyota collects personal information such as name, address, driving license number, phone number, email, and driving behavior, including acceleration, speed, braking functionality, and travel direction. It may also gather favorite locations saved on its systems and images taken by external cameras or sensors. Some models of Toyota cars can also scan drivers' faces for face recognition. It is unknown whether Toyota collects data from people's phones that are synced with its vehicles. Commenters in the discussion express varying opinions about data privacy, government regulation, and the role of car manufacturers in protecting consumer privacy. They also discuss matters related to driving safety, such as the need for better visibility in modern cars and the impact of pre-collision driving systems on driver behavior.

As the adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) continues to increase in many companies, job losses are expected to mount in the short term. However, companies that position themselves to innovate with AI will be able to mitigate this risk by creating new jobs and keeping unemployment low. Some companies are already using generative AI to empower employees to do more and increase productivity. A radical redesign of corporate processes may allow companies to spark all sorts of new value creation, ultimately creating new jobs. Innovation, not cutting costs, will position companies to thrive in the long run.

The discussion includes different perspectives on the impact of AI on employment and services. One user argues that introducing technology does not necessarily lead to job replacement but rather creates new job opportunities and increases productivity. Another user points out that the quality of customer support may suffer due to the use of AI. There is also a discussion about monopolies not prioritizing good service, and a user argues that AI cannot comprehensively understand problems and that replacing employees with AI creates competition within companies.
