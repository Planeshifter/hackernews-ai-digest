that it allows for fast, query-able permissions checks at a global scale. Warrant, inspired by Zanzibar, also adopts this design. By centralizing the authorization data, Warrant can perform efficient access checks across any authz model with low latency. It also enables companies to have a single source of truth for all permissions, simplifying the maintenance and management of complex authz models. However, one drawback of this approach is that it may introduce a single point of failure. To address this, Warrant has implemented a distributed architecture that can handle failover scenarios gracefully. Overall, through its intuitive and uniform data model, logical separation of authorization and application logic, centralized storage and efficient query capabilities, Zanzibar and frameworks like Warrant have made great strides in improving modern authorization infrastructure.

Privacy4Cars released a new tool called the Vehicle Privacy Report that reveals how much information car manufacturers can collect from your vehicle's data. The tool creates privacy labels for what manufacturers collect and whom they share data with. Typically, most modern vehicles are like "smartphones on wheels," with the ability to collect significant amounts of data wirelessly and send the information to manufacturers. The Vehicle Privacy Report works by using a car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and analyzing each manufacturer's public policy documents. The study showed Toyota collects personal information such as name, address, driving license number, phone number, email, and driving behavior, including acceleration, speed, braking functionality, and travel direction. It may also gather favorite locations saved on its systems and images taken by external cameras or sensors. Some models of Toyota cars can also scan drivers' faces for face recognition. It is unknown whether Toyota collects data from people's phones that are synced with its vehicles.
