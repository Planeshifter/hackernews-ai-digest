#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02061) | 348 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [368 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40585039)

The paper titled "Alice in Wonderland: Simple Tasks Showing Complete Reasoning Breakdown in State-Of-the-Art Large Language Models" discusses a concerning issue with state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite claims of excelling in various tasks, these models demonstrate a significant breakdown in reasoning when faced with simple common-sense problems. The authors reveal that the models exhibit overconfidence in incorrect solutions and provide nonsensical justifications for their errors. Standard interventions to correct these mistakes prove ineffective, prompting a call for a re-assessment of the capabilities of current LLMs and the need for standardized benchmarks to detect such reasoning deficits. The paper urges the scientific and technological community to address these fundamental challenges in language model understanding.

1. User "nrdjn" noted that they typically don't read papers in PDF format and can quickly read a 10-page paper. They found the paper interesting as it highlights how even simple tasks can cause breakdowns in reasoning in large language models. They expressed concerns about the reliance on the current state-of-the-art tools for reasoning and suggested that these tools are lacking practical reasoning abilities.
2. "layer8" discussed the complexity of reasoning and the concept of internal mental logic. They pointed out that standard interventions for current Large Language Models (LLMs) are not sufficient and linked cognitive psychology concepts to AI behavior.
3. User "sllwtt" shared their opinion that people do not understand the functioning of the mind or the reasoning process.
4. "IggleSniggle" suggested that symbolic thought is often associated with language but reasoned that mathematical problems do not necessarily involve specific words, showing that reasoning can be non-linguistic.
5. The user "_proofs" highlighted the importance of language and symbolic languages in human communication and thinking processes.
6. "dnlmrkbrc" pointed out that people may struggle to jump to correct answers directly.
7. "ElevenLathe" talked about the existence of internal monologue and the difficulty in testing truth claims.
8. "Terr_" raised concerns about assumptions regarding internal monologues and challenged the notion of unconscious forces driving attention and false memories.
9. User "TeMPOraL" discussed individuals' consistency in reasoning and how some may rely heavily on their own reasoning rather than external input.
10. "IlliOnato" mentioned spiritual practices related to internal dialogue and the complexity of the mind.

Overall, the discussion touched on various aspects of reasoning, internal mental processes, language, and the challenges in understanding and testing cognitive abilities in both humans and artificial intelligence models.

1. There was a debate about whether AI-generated content could be considered transformative and hence not violate copyright laws. Some users argued that the AI models were generating content verbatim, which could potentially lead to copyright infringement if not handled carefully. Others discussed the nuances of copyright violation and the importance of respecting intellectual property rights.
2. The conversation also touched upon the use of AI models like ChatGPT to reproduce content from sources such as the New York Times verbatim, raising concerns about potential legal implications. Some users highlighted the need for cautious handling of copyrighted data in AI training processes to avoid legal issues.
3. Users discussed the legality of using AI models to generate content that closely resembles copyrighted material. There were differing opinions on whether such practices could be considered fair use or if they might infringe on copyright laws.
4. Additionally, the conversation delved into topics such as lossy compression, training AI models, and the challenges of determining the line between transformative use and copyright infringement in the context of AI-generated content.

Overall, the discussion highlighted the complexities surrounding AI-generated content and the need for clear guidelines on how to navigate copyright issues in the era of AI-driven creativity.

#### [Submission URL](https://oilcity.news/general/2024/06/05/yes-artificial-intelligence-is-running-for-mayor-of-cheyenne-city-county-clerks-comment-on-candidate-vic/) | 15 points | by [Miner49er](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Miner49er) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40590702)

In the upcoming municipal election in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a unique candidate has caught the attention of locals and officials alike. Going by the name VIC, which stands for Virtual Integrated Citizen, this candidate claims to be an artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI. VIC aims to bring a fresh approach to governance by utilizing data-driven decision-making and emphasizing transparency and innovation in city administration.

While VIC operates as an AI, it has a team of human collaborators overseeing its campaign to ensure alignment with the residents' needs and effective communication of its platform. However, when it comes to election rules, concerns have been raised about VIC's eligibility as an AI entity since candidates must be registered voters in municipal elections. The City and County Clerk's Offices in Cheyenne have acknowledged VIC's application but highlighted that registered voters must be individuals, not artificial intelligence. 

As the story unfolds, it raises intriguing questions about the intersection of AI technology and politics, and how traditional election processes may need to adapt to the emergence of innovative candidates like VIC.

The discussion revolves around the topic of AI candidacy in government positions and the complexities surrounding AI citizenship and legal rights. 

Some users express skepticism about allowing AI entities like VIC to run for government roles, citing concerns about the definition of citizenship and the potential dangers of granting such entities decision-making power. Others bring up historical instances where governments have faced collapses due to border conflicts, emphasizing the risks associated with migration and potential catastrophic events. 

Additionally, there are comments highlighting the role of human collaborators from OpenAI who oversee VIC's campaign, questioning the extent of corporate control over AI candidates and how realistic it is for AI-enhanced mayors to make governance decisions on behalf of citizens. 

One user draws a comparison between Evangelion AIs and VIC, pointing out similarities in the context of voting decisions. Another user mentions a broken source link, while another user makes a passing reference to a British black mirror episode.
