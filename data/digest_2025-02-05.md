**Summary of Hacker News Discussion: Replacing OCR Vendors with LLMs (e.g., Gemini)**

The discussion centers on transitioning from traditional OCR vendors to using large language models (LLMs) like Google’s Gemini for PDF processing, addressing challenges and broader implications:

1. **Shift to LLM-Based OCR**:
   - A user replaced a specialized OCR vendor with Gemini, achieving **96% accuracy** but noting **4% error rates** remain critical for certain documents (e.g., LLC filings, handwritten text). Gemini streamlined workflow but raised questions about high-context models and multi-model handling.
   - Legacy OCR vendors face disruption as LLMs standardize data extraction schemas, shifting focus from raw text extraction to **validation, confidence scoring, and integration**.

2. **Accuracy Improvements**:
   - **Chain-of-thought prompting** and predefined JSON schemas help improve structured data extraction. 
   - Human-in-the-loop validation and hybrid approaches (LLMs + classical methods) are emphasized for reliability.

3. **Risks of Vendor Lock-In**:
   - LLM providers (e.g., Google) risk creating **customer captivity** through proprietary APIs. Users highlight the volatility of closed-model APIs, where version/configuration changes introduce **inconsistent results**.
   - Open-source models are suggested to avoid dependency, but reproducibility remains challenging due to non-deterministic model updates.

4. **Technical Challenges with Determinism**:
   - LLM outputs can vary due to **temperature settings**, hardware differences, and floating-point inaccuracies (e.g., parallel GPU operations introducing non-determinism).
   - Lower temperatures (e.g., zero) make outputs more deterministic, but true reproducibility requires tight control over hardware, frameworks, and model versions—often impractical.

5. **Broader Implications**:
   - Claims that "LLMs commoditize data extraction" face skepticism; complex systems still require traditional ETL, governance, and stakeholder alignment.
   - Vendors may optimize hardware (e.g., ASICs) for cost, further complicating reproducibility. Formal verification of floating-point operations is proposed but deemed niche.

**Key Takeaway**: While LLMs like Gemini offer cost and simplicity advantages over traditional OCR, adoption requires balancing accuracy validation, hybrid tooling, and avoiding over-reliance on closed ecosystems. Reproducibility and long-term consistency remain unresolved technical hurdles.

### The New York Times Has Spent $10.8M in Its Legal Battle with OpenAI So Far

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/) | 81 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952306)

In a tug-of-war over the future of media content, some major publishers have opted to embrace AI, pocketing substantial payouts from OpenAI in exchange for allowing their content to fuel ChatGPT and similar technologies. This approach seems to offer a steady revenue stream as traditional internet advertising faces uncertainty. For instance, Dotdash Meredith reported an annual intake of $16 million from such a licensing deal, while News Corp has touted its agreement with OpenAI as transformative.

However, The New York Times has taken a defiant path, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using its content without permission, arguing for compensation to the tune of billions for what they see as unlawful actions. This legal crusade has cost The Times a hefty $10.8 million in AI-related litigation expenses for 2024. Standing firm on their principles, The Times is positioned as one of the few publishers robust enough, buoyed by over 11 million subscribers, to confront tech titans in court.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has publicly disagreed with The Times’ severe stance, suggesting that their legal approach could place them on "the wrong side of history." As the tussle continues, it highlights a broader industry dilemma: how to balance the potential tech benefits with fair compensation for original content creators. Meanwhile, industry giants including Vogue's parent Condé Nast, Time magazine, and others have still chosen licensing agreements, which are designed for mutual benefit, albeit with renegotiation options in the near future.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legal and ethical implications of OpenAI using copyrighted content, particularly highlighted by *The New York Times* (NYT) lawsuit. Key arguments and themes include:

1. **Verbatim Reproduction & Copyright Infringement**:  
   - Participants debate whether ChatGPT’s ability to reproduce NYT articles verbatim—even with extensive "prompt engineering"—constitutes copyright violation. Examples cited include OpenAI’s use of 10,000 prompts to generate near-identical copies of NYT content, which critics argue demonstrates intentional infringement.  
   - **Counterarguments** suggest OpenAI’s model, like mathematical sequences (e.g., generating Pi digits), isn’t inherently infringing unless outputs directly replicate copyrighted works. However, others insist *exact reproductions*, even via tokenized data, violate copyright law regardless of technical methods.

2. **Technical vs. Legal Interpretations**:  
   - Disagreements arise over whether AI-generated outputs using tokenized training data are equivalent to direct copying. Some argue copyright law cares only about the end result (exact reproductions), not the process, while others claim algorithms transforming data into new outputs are distinct from traditional infringement.  
   - Analogies like sharing a Marvel movie via BitTorrent (clearly illegal) versus AI indirectly reconstructing content highlight tensions between intent and technical execution.

3. **Corporate Power Dynamics**:  
   - Critics argue corporations like OpenAI exploit copyrighted material at scale, contrasting with individual creators who face harsher scrutiny. The framing pits “production” (corporations monetizing AI) against “consumption” (individuals sharing content), with concerns that the legal system favors entities with resources.  
   - OpenAI’s dismissive stance toward NYT’s claims is seen as emblematic of tech giants undermining content creators’ rights.

4. **OpenAI’s Defense & Legal Strategy**:  
   - OpenAI’s argument that training on publicly available data is legitimate faces skepticism. Critics liken it to “IP laundering,” where copyrighted content is obscured through AI processes. Others question if prompt-based outputs absolve liability, especially when users deliberately extract paywalled articles.  
   - The NYT’s lawsuit hinges on proving OpenAI’s models were designed to replicate proprietary content, with evidence of systematic verbatim outputs strengthening their case.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores unresolved tensions between AI innovation and copyright enforcement, with participants split on whether existing laws adequately address AI’s unique challenges. While technical nuances complicate legal judgments, the NYT’s case highlights growing scrutiny over AI’s reliance on uncompensated copyrighted material.

### Huawei's Ascend 910C delivers 60% of Nvidia H100 inference performance

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-research-suggests-huaweis-ascend-910c-delivers-60-percent-nvidia-h100-inference-performance) | 115 points | by [sien](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sien) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42943906)

Amidst the ongoing semiconductor race, Huawei has upped its ante by unveiling the HiSilicon Ascend 910C, a revamped version of the Ascend 910 AI processor. Despite trailing behind Nvidia's H100 in raw performance, the 910C aims to reduce China's reliance on American GPUs and asserts an interesting value proposition in AI inference tasks, delivering about 60% of the performance of Nvidia's market-leading offering. 

DeepSeek's research reveals that with minor kernel optimizations, the 910C could significantly exceed expectations in inference performance, hinting at Huawei's evolving capabilities despite facing U.S. sanctions and limited TSMC process tech access. Through DeepSeek's PyTorch repository, engineers can transition from CUDA to CUNN with less hassle, facilitating Huawei's processor integration into existing AI workflows.

Though China still struggles in the training reliability sphere—where Nvidia leads due to its longstanding hardware-software ecosystem integration—the Ascend 910C showcases promise as a competitive option. However, experts argue that Huawei's infrastructure needs refinement to stand firm on a global footing, especially in the wake of more complex Transformer architectures in AI models.

In the bigger picture, Huawei and SMIC have progressed to match capabilities dating back to TSMC's 2019–2020 offerings. This iteration of Huawei's AI chip utilizes SMIC’s 2nd Generation 7nm-class N+2 process, invoking a sense of catching up despite lagging behind cutting-edge tech. As the scene unfolds, many eyes remain on whether Huawei can challenge Nvidia's AI training dominance while sustaining inroads made in the inference landscape.

### Summary of Discussion:  
The Hacker News discussion about Huawei’s Ascend 910C AI chip and China’s semiconductor progress revolves around **technical challenges**, **geopolitical dynamics**, and **commercial viability debates**:

#### **1. Technical Challenges and SMIC’s Progress**  
- **Yield Comparisons**: SMIC’s 7nm-class (N+2) process reportedly achieves ~20% yields for the Ascend 910C, significantly lower than TSMC’s mature 7nm yields (~90% for Huawei’s Kirin 9000S phone chips). Skeptics argue larger chip sizes (e.g., 665mm2 for Ascend 910C vs. ~100mm2 for Kirin) severely impact yields, raising cost concerns.  
- **Design Improvements**: The 910C is noted as a redesign ("chiplet" packaging) of the 910B (previously made by TSMC), suggesting iterative progress. However, critics highlight Huawei/SMIC still rely on older DUV lithography tools like ASML’s NXT:2000i, lagging behind cutting-edge EUV tech.  

#### **2. Geopolitical Tensions and Taiwan**  
- **Taiwan’s Silicon Shield**: Users debate whether China’s semiconductor ambitions are tied to reunification with Taiwan. Some argue China aims to “make TSMC irrelevant” by advancing domestic production (via SMIC) and reducing reliance on Taiwanese/Western tech. Others counter that TSMC’s fabs would be destroyed in a conflict, leaving China dependent on U.S.-allied ASML tools regardless.  
- **Sanctions and Decoupling**: U.S. export controls on high-end GPUs (e.g., H100) and equipment (ASML EUV) force China to prioritize self-reliance. However, skeptics note China’s AI chips still trail in efficiency and scale, relying on subsidies and state-backed cloud projects.  

#### **3. Commercial Viability and Energy Costs**  
- **Subsidies vs. Market Realities**: Critics argue Huawei’s chips (and phones) survive due to heavy government subsidies and “political pricing,” not true commercial competitiveness. Others counter that China’s cheaper electricity (vs. Europe/U.S.) could offset power-hungry AI chips like the 910C.  
- **Nvidia’s Dominance**: Nvidia’s H100 (costing $3k to produce, sold at $25k) exemplifies Western pricing power. China struggles to match this due to sanctions, design limitations, and software ecosystem gaps (e.g., CUDA’s dominance).  

#### **4. Broader Implications**  
- **Global Supply Chains**: A hypothetical China-Taiwan conflict would disrupt chip supplies, but Taiwan’s “Silicon Shield” is seen as weakening as SMIC advances and the West reshores production (e.g., TSMC Arizona).  
- **AGI and Governance**: Some warn China’s centralized governance risks misaligned AI development, though others dismiss this as Western bias.  

**TL;DR**: Huawei/SMIC’s Ascend 910C shows incremental progress in AI inference but faces yield, efficiency, and ecosystem hurdles. Geopolitically, China’s chip push is intertwined with Taiwan tensions and tech decoupling, though doubts persist about sustainability without subsidies or cutting-edge tools. Nvidia’s software/hardware dominance remains unmatched.

### Revolutionizing software testing: Introducing LLM-powered bug catchers

#### [Submission URL](https://engineering.fb.com/2025/02/05/security/revolutionizing-software-testing-llm-powered-bug-catchers-meta-ach/) | 7 points | by [nadis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nadis) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42953365)

Meta's latest tool, Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH), is revolutionizing the landscape of software testing and security. This innovative system leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of mutation-guided test generation, specifically targeting undetected faults (mutants) within source code. ACH excels where traditional methods fall short by focusing on actual faults rather than simply increasing code coverage. It transforms vague descriptions of potential bugs into a powerful suite of tests, automatically generating both realistic faults and the tests to catch them.

At its core, ACH carries out three pivotal steps: engineers describe the bugs they are concerned about, ACH automatically generates a multitude of bugs, and finally, it creates tests to specifically catch these threats. This process not only enhances code resilience against regressions but does so efficiently and effectively, saving precious human labor.

Meta has already applied ACH to several platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and found it particularly useful for strengthening code against specific concerns. The tool is adaptable to any class of faults, promising to modernize automated test generation and help engineers derive actionable insights from diverse informational sources.

The significance of ACH lies not just in its technical innovation but also in its potential to simplify risk assessments, lighten cognitive burdens for developers, and bolster overall online safety. Future plans include expanding the deployment of ACH, seeking industry-wide adoption, and further advancing the system’s capabilities to optimize compliance testing. With ACH, Meta is setting a new standard for how we harden software systems against the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.

The discussion revolves around two primary threads:  

1. **Test Generation & SWE-Bench Integration**:  
   - A user (`wstrnr`) discusses connecting test-generation capabilities (via SWE-Bench and a multimodal leaderboard).  
   - Another user (`chrstnsn`) inquires about the specifics, asking how test-generation tools (like Meta’s ACH) generate valid tests and address SWE-Bench issues.  
   - `wstrnr` clarifies that ACH uses code-adjacent comments and context to resolve SWE-Bench testing challenges.  

2. **Research Paper Recognition**:  
   - `wstrnr` shares a link to Meta’s 2025 scholarly paper on **mutation-guided LLM-based test generation**, referencing ACH’s methodology.  
   - Another user (`nds`) appreciates the direct link to the research, highlighting interest in technical details.  

Key themes: Focus on automating test generation via language models (Meta’s ACH), integration with benchmarking tools like SWE-Bench, and community interest in scholarly work underpinning practical solutions.
