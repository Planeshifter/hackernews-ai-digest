#### [Submission URL](https://willwhitney.com/computing-inside-ai.html) | 89 points | by [pongogogo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pongogogo) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42415875)

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, there's a compelling argument to rethink our approach to interaction with large models like ChatGPT. Traditionally, we've treated these AIs as "agents" akin to human assistants, which encourages slow, conversation-based exchanges. This model-as-person metaphor, while intuitive, restricts our ability to harness the true power of AI.

A fresh perspective proposed is the model-as-computer metaphor. This conceptual shift urges us to view AI more like robust applications on our devices, leading to a more efficient and dynamic way of interaction. Instead of merely typing queries into a text box, users would engage with an AI through a rich graphical interface. Picture buttons, sliders, and visual aids that make exploring capabilities more intuitive and immediate.

This interactive approach emphasizes two major improvements: Discoverability and Efficiency. By offering a visual toolkit, AI can suggest various functionalities and guide users on how to achieve their goals—similar to how design software presents editing options. Recognizing the limitations of text-based input, the model-as-computer framework allows for quicker, more precise manipulations. Imagine exploring creative possibilities in real-time rather than through an extended conversation.

As we continue to traverse the early stages of powerful AI, questioning prevailing metaphors and embracing new ways of interaction can help unlock the full potential of these technologies. The future of AI isn’t merely about increasing model size or complexity but also about revolutionizing how we communicate and create with these tools.

The discussion on Hacker News centered around the proposed shift from viewing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as "agents" (human-like assistants) to seeing them as "computers" (robust applications). Several commenters reacted to this metaphor change, emphasizing the challenges and potential benefits of a more interactive graphical interface for AI.

1. **Text-based Limitations**: Many participants noted the inefficiency of text-based conversations, which can feel slow and limiting. They argued that a graphical interface could facilitate quicker, more intuitive interactions with AI, enabling users to explore features and functionalities dynamically, through buttons and sliders instead of lengthy exchanges.

2. **Discoverability and Control**: Users pointed out that a well-designed interface could improve discoverability, making it easier to access features and functionalities that would otherwise be hidden in text prompts. Some commenters suggested that the existing model was too restrictive and failed to leverage the full power of AI.

3. **Challenges of Implementation**: Not everyone agreed on the practicality of this new approach. Some voiced concerns about technical limitations, suggesting that building such interfaces might require considerable effort and rethinking from current systems.

4. **Human vs. Machine Interaction**: There was a debate about the best way to communicate with AI. While some favored the richer interaction model, others suggested that human-like conversation is still a valid and necessary avenue, encapsulating the subtleties of human dialogues that could be lost in purely graphical interfaces.

5. **Potential for Revolutionizing AI Usage**: Overall, the discussion underscored the potential for changing user interfaces to unlock new capabilities in AI, emphasizing the need for innovation not just in model complexity but in how users interact with these technologies. The dialogue highlighted a clear recognition of the evolving nature of AI interaction as an essential consideration for future developments. 

Participants acknowledged that implementing such an interface would not be straightforward and would require new thinking in user experience design and accessibility for non-technical users.

### Byte Latent Transformer: Patches Scale Better Than Tokens

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/byte-latent-transformer-patches-scale-better-than-tokens/?_fb_noscript=1) | 363 points | by [zxexz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zxexz) | [82 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42415122)

A groundbreaking advancement in natural language processing is here with the introduction of the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT), a new byte-level large language model architecture that matches the performance of traditional tokenization-based models while demonstrating impressive gains in inference efficiency and robustness. 

The innovative BLT encodes data into dynamically sized patches rather than fixed tokens, adapting its computational power based on the complexity of the incoming data. This dynamic segmentation allows the model to optimize performance by utilizing longer patches for predictable data and improving reasoning and generalization capabilities for diverse information. 

Recent findings from a comprehensive study involving 8 billion parameters and 4 trillion training bytes underscore BLT’s remarkable scaling potential, proving that models can thrive using raw byte data without a fixed vocabulary. Overall, BLT eclipses traditional models, making it a promising step forward in the field of AI and machine learning. 

For those eager to delve deeper into this research, the full paper is available for download.

The discussion surrounding the Byte Latent Transformer (BLT) submission on Hacker News primarily engaged with its implications and comparisons to traditional tokenization methods. 

**Key Points from the Discussion:**

1. **Character-Level vs. Token-Level Models**: Several commenters reflected on the differences in how character-based models, like BLT, compare against token-based models, particularly their potential efficiency and representation capabilities.

2. **Dynamic Patch Sizes**: There was notable enthusiasm for BLT’s innovative approach of using dynamically sized patches, which allows for better handling of complex inputs compared to fixed token sizes, leading to improved inference performance.

3. **Training and Scalability**: The model's significant training on raw byte data and its ability to scale up were acknowledged positively, with participants discussing the potential applications and benefits of models that utilize raw data rather than a predefined vocabulary.

4. **Comparison to Previous Models**: Some users referenced established models like BERT and RNNs, indicating how BLT might surpass them in terms of handling irregular data structures. The potential for BLT to address limitations found in traditional models was a common thread.

5. **Research and Future Directions**: Commenters showed interest in the research trajectory and potential practical applications of BLT, as well as wanting to explore further implications for machine learning frameworks and real-world applications. 

6. **Curiosity and Skepticism**: A mixture of excitement and skepticism was apparent, with some users expressing cautious optimism about the efficacy of byte-based approaches while others raised questions about implementation and stability.

Overall, the discussion underscores the anticipation around BLT's capabilities in enhancing natural language processing, highlighting a community eager to explore the implications of this advancement in AI.
