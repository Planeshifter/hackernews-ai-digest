### Nepenthes is a tarpit to catch AI web crawlers

#### [Submission URL](https://zadzmo.org/code/nepenthes/) | 580 points | by [blendergeek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=blendergeek) | [206 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42725147)

A fresh entrant in the digital defense arena, **Nepenthes 1.0** has emerged as a cunning tarpit designed to ensnare web crawlers, especially those scraping data for large language models (LLMs). Mimicking the predatory nature of its namesake plant, this software creates an infinite loop of interlinked pages, effectively distracting crawlers from their intended targets. Pages are generated randomly, yet in a controlled manner, making them appear as static files—perfect for baiting unwanted scraping activities.

Nepenthes not only prolongs the search for data with built-in intentional delays but also offers an optional feature known as **Markov-babble**, generating nonsensical content that crawlers can scrape, potentially leading to accelerated model deterioration. However, users are cautioned: deploying this software comes with significant risks, including increased CPU load and the potential to disappear from search engine results.

Intended for use behind more secure servers like Nginx or Apache, Nepenthes disguises itself as an ordinary site component. The implementation process involves using either Docker or manual installation, with comprehensive guidance provided for setting up and configuring the tool.

If you're interested in defending against relentless LLM scrapers, you may want to explore Nepenthes. Just remember to tread carefully; this tool is not for the faint of heart or novice users!

The discussion surrounding the release of **Nepenthes 1.0** features a mix of skepticism and technical insights regarding its potential effectiveness and implications. Users reflect on a recent security vulnerability involving the ChatGPT API that allowed for a simple HTTP request to trigger a massive flood of 5000 requests, leading to an unintentional denial of service condition. This incident raised questions about OpenAI's responsiveness to security issues, with some participants noting the challenges of reporting such vulnerabilities to corporate entities and the sluggish responses from their support teams.

Several commenters expressed their surprise that OpenAI would not prioritize fixing reported vulnerabilities, while others reflected on the broader state of security practices in tech companies, suggesting that typical large organizations might struggle with timely response and remediation efforts. Participants discussed the inherent difficulties in dealing with vulnerabilities in complex systems, emphasizing the nuanced strategies needed to maintain security without sacrificing accessibility or performance.

The conversation noted concerns about resource allocation in addressing these security gaps, with an underlying sentiment that high-value bounty programs might encourage better engagement from security experts. Reflecting on system vulnerabilities, some users shared their backgrounds in security and expressed support for initiatives like BugCrowd that aim to facilitate more structured and effective reporting channels.

Overall, the discussion depicts a community grappling with both the excitement of new security tools like Nepenthes and the caution required in their implementation, considering past experiences with vulnerability management at familiar tech giants. Participants underscored the need for vigilance and proactive measures in combatting relentless scraping and other security threats in the evolving technological landscape.

In a move to combat aggressive automated scraping, the Federal Register has implemented new access restrictions on its website. Users looking to access FederalRegister.gov and eCFR.gov will need to navigate a verification process if their IP is not already whitelisted. This involves solving a CAPTCHA to gain access, with permissions set to expire every three months. Additionally, if users want access from a broader range of IPs, they must first gain approval for their current address and then submit a request for more extensive access through the site’s feedback feature. The initiative aims to protect the integrity of the data while still ensuring human users can engage with federal resources.
