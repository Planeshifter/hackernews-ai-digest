#### [Submission URL](https://montyanderson.net/writing/embeddings) | 68 points | by [montyanderson](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=montyanderson) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38645411)

Monty Anderson, in his blog post titled "Embeddings, Vectors, and Arithmetic," explores the concept of embeddings as a representation of text and the computational operations that can be performed on them. He references Lilian Weng's project, which showcases a ranking of the closest emojis to a search query in the meaning-space. The emoji vectors are calculated using the OpenAI's Ada model, and the results are based on the euclidean distance or cosine similarity. Building on this idea, Anderson and Barney Hill developed an app that allows users to add two emojis and find the closest known emoji to that result. While the project worked well, it also revealed the stereotypes and flaws present in the training data. Anderson mentions their exploration of building safety systems at Prodia by checking if input prompts are within a distance threshold of known adult or illegal concepts. The post concludes by hinting at a fuzzy future where machines can reason about meaning in various types of data, not just text.

The discussions around Monty Anderson's blog post "Embeddings, Vectors, and Arithmetic" cover various aspects related to vector embeddings and their applications. 
User "YPCrumble" expresses their interest in vector embeddings, while user "wyncchrn" asks a question about embeddings in linear space and discusses how addition operations can make sense. User "bnrymx" comments that the blog post does not mention that the training data used GloVe, a popular model for word vector spaces. Other users add positive comments about embeddings, with one mentioning the usefulness of GloVe and another noting that linear models and PCA can be employed.
User "throwup238" shares their experience in building safety systems at Prodia, where they investigate distance thresholds for known adult or illegal concepts. They mention that these measures are necessary due to the limitations and uncertainties of embedding models.
The conversation continues with discussions about embedding categorization, fingerprints, and retrieval results for different sizes of text. User "mntyndrsn" comments on using embedding for safety filters and having different models for different purposes. User "batch12" mentions their struggle with semantic meaning in retrieval results. User "ptr" suggests expanding the process of using various tools for embedding-based search.
User "ttcr" raises concerns about embeddings and illegal concepts, noting that embeddings are not objective and that measuring similarity distances should not punish or censor certain concepts. User "rbrnd" argues that embeddings are not objective due to the complexity of training data, while expressing their love for AI finding traditional winter message boards. The discussion then diverges into debates about censorship, privacy, and the influence of AI technology on society.
