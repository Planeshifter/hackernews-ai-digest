Title: "Consciousness in Artificial Intelligence: Insights from the Science of Consciousness"

A new paper published on arXiv explores the question of whether AI systems can possess consciousness. The authors, Patrick Butlin and 18 other scientists, argue for a rigorous and empirically grounded approach to assessing the consciousness of AI systems. By examining existing AI systems in light of neuroscientific theories of consciousness, they identify "indicator properties" of consciousness that can be applied to AI systems.

The authors survey several scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. They then use these theories to derive computational terms that can be used as indicators of consciousness in AI systems. 

The analysis of several recent AI systems using these indicators suggests that none of the current AI systems are conscious. However, the authors point out that there are no technical barriers to building AI systems that satisfy these indicators. 

Overall, this paper sheds light on the scientific understanding of consciousness as it relates to AI systems and highlights the need for further research in this area. It also addresses the increasing public concern regarding the consciousness of AI systems.

### Prompting, realized, and unrealized bias in generative AI

#### [Submission URL](http://marble.onl/posts/code_of_practice_and_bias.html) | 13 points | by [andy99](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andy99) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37220885)

In a recent article, Andrew Marble discusses the topic of bias in generative AI and explores a newly introduced code of practice for generative AI models. Marble highlights that while addressing bias is important, it is crucial to differentiate between dataset bias and biased system performance. With bigger and smarter models, the focus should shift from data bias to configuring the system properly to ensure unbiased performance. Marble also reflects on a voluntary "code of practice" for generative AI published by Industry Canada, which includes points like identifying malicious and inappropriate use, curating datasets, mitigating biased output, and providing clear identification of AI systems. Marble critiques the requirement to watermark AI-generated content, deeming it unnecessary and easily bypassed. However, Marble agrees with the idea of labeling AI systems to ensure transparency and accountability. Marble then delves into the discussion of bias, emphasizing the need for datasets that are both appropriate and representative. While acknowledging the importance of training data and bias, Marble suggests exercising judgment based on the specific application. In some cases, bias may not be a significant concern. Overall, the article provides insights into bias in generative AI and offers a critical perspective on the proposed code of practice.

The discussion on this submission seems to be focused on the topic of bias in generative AI. One commenter, "jxf," points out that their comment is unrelated and mentions an unnamed top-level domain. Another commenter, "zrthstrl," expresses their perspective on bias from a functional standpoint, stating that generating output based on knowledge from biased inputs wastes energy. They argue that the discussion should be focused on copying the function of physical systems instead of discussing biased generative AI. The commenter implies that bias is not necessarily a significant concern in generative AI models.

In response to "zrthstrl," "giraffe_lady" disagrees and argues that bias does exist in existing generative models and that addressing it is important. They mention the impact of bias on society and highlight the need to recognize and correct biased outputs. However, their comment is flagged, and another commenter, "dng," acknowledges that personal attacks are against the guidelines and asks "giraffe_lady" to review them.

In further discussion, "giraffe_lady" mentions a history of comments and interactions, claiming that they have been banned but do not believe they have violated the rules. They express frustration and request clarification from the community. "dng" responds by asserting that the commenter has repeatedly violated the guidelines and shares links to previous instances. Another commenter, "JieJie," mentions that the generative models can reproduce morally questionable content and suggests viewing the guidelines for more understanding.

The discussion in this thread seems to have deviated from the topic of bias in generative AI and instead focuses on personal interactions and rule violations.
