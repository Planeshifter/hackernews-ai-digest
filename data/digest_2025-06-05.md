### From tokens to thoughts: How LLMs and humans trade compression for meaning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) | 118 points | by [ggirelli](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ggirelli) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44189426)

A fresh perspective on how humans and large language models (LLMs) process information has recently emerged from a fascinating study titled "From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning." Spearheaded by Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, this research probes the intersection of semantic compression and meaning—a cognitive feat humans perform naturally. The study employs an innovative framework inspired by Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to compare human and LLM strategies.

Humans instinctively categorize information, compressing it while preserving meaning, like identifying a robin and blue jay as birds despite their differences. LLMs boast impressive linguistic abilities but reveal key distinctions from human cognition. The study concludes that while LLMs can form broad categories aligning with human judgments, they miss the nuanced semantic subtleties crucial for human understanding. An even more striking difference is their tendency for aggressive statistical compression, often at the cost of contextual richness.

The findings suggest that LLMs may benefit from adopting more human-like strategies that balance compression with nuance. As AI developers seek pathways to refine LLMs, these insights offer a roadmap toward more human-centric AI models, highlighting the gap in cognitive architectures and the potential for harmonious blending of LLM capability with human-like comprehension.

The Hacker News discussion on the study comparing human and LLM information processing reveals several key themes and critiques:

### **1. Methodological Concerns**  
- **Embedding Validity**: Users debate the paper’s use of token-level embeddings and intermediate representations (e.g., `vln` questions whether analyzing token embeddings directly aligns with human judgments). Critics argue that stripping away contextual nuances (e.g., single-word analysis vs. full-sentence processing) risks oversimplification.  
- **Model Size vs. Performance**: Participants (e.g., `boroboro4`) question whether model size correlates meaningfully with "alignment" to human cognition. Larger models may prioritize statistical compression over nuanced meaning.  

### **2. Semantic vs. Statistical Priorities**  
- Skeptics (e.g., `johnnyApplePRNG`) frame LLMs as “statistical tools” optimized for prediction, with their architecture inherently tied to loss minimization. Others counter that statistical accuracy and problem-solving sophistication aren’t mutually exclusive (`Nevermark`).  

### **3. Linguistic Nuances**  
- A subthread explores challenges in cross-linguistic alignment (`fsndvct`, `blfrbrnd`), such as translating rhymes (e.g., Dutch Sinterklaas poems to English) or culturally loaded terms (e.g., Chinese political satire like *Grass Mud Horse*). This highlights inconsistencies in LLMs’ handling of polysemy and cultural context.  

### **4. Broader Skepticism**  
- Some dismiss the study as incomplete or misleading (`catchnear4321`), while others reference debates like LLMs as “stochastic parrots” (`xwt`), underscoring unresolved questions about whether LLMs truly *understand* language or merely mimic patterns.  

### **5. Meta-Commentary**  
- Yann LeCun’s involvement draws surprise (`dnlbln`), reflecting his historical critiques of transformer models. The discussion occasionally veers into political/cultural references (e.g., Chinese censorship), illustrating how technical debates often intersect with broader societal issues.  

### **Takeaway**  
The thread captures a mix of technical critiques (methodology, model architecture) and philosophical debates (meaning vs. compression), with skepticism about whether current LLMs can ever replicate human-like semantic understanding. Linguistic and cultural examples serve as grounding points for broader concerns about AI’s limitations.

Critics liken it to stifling competition under the guise of ethical AI, with remarks like “Elon’s agenda is self-made genius” dominating the thread. Others defend Musk as a visionary prioritizing humanity’s long-term survival.

2. **Ethics and Legal Gray Areas**: Comments highlight unresolved debates on data ownership and AI ethics. Some users question whether restricting data use prevents abuse or entrenches corporate control. Others propose alternatives, such as explicit opt-in requirements for training data or transparency in AI model weights. Copyright concerns emerge, with references to outdated laws (e.g., 1926 Harvard Library rights) and calls for modernizing regulations for AI.

3. **Enforcement Challenges**: Skepticism abounds about enforcing these rules, given the ease of data scraping and the precedent of platforms like Reddit monetizing data access. Users note that determined AI firms could bypass restrictions via VPNs or third-party data brokers, rendering the policy symbolic.

4. **Broader Cultural References**: The thread diverges into speculative tangents, including comparisons to “Roko’s Basilisk” (an AI thought experiment) and critiques of tech leaders’ influence on legislation. Mentions of Peter Thiel and jabs at legislative inefficiency (“Big Beautiful Bill” parodies) underscore cynicism about corporate power shaping AI policy.

5. **Doubt Over X’s Strategy**: Some argue that X’s strict policies contradict its prior openness, harming developer relations and platform relevance. Critics claim Musk’s $44B acquisition has led to a more insular, culturally controlled platform, potentially hastening its decline.
