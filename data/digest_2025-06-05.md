Stanford researchers have unveiled Tokasaurus, a cutting-edge inference engine built to tackle high-throughput workloads for large language models (LLMs). This new engine aims to enhance performance in scenarios where total batch completion time and cost are prioritized over single-instance latency.

The team behind Tokasaurus, including scholars like Jordan Juravsky and Ayush Chakravarthy, developed this tool to excel with both small and large models. Notably, Tokasaurus is designed to handle tasks like scanning entire codebases or generating vast amounts of synthetic data, which differ significantly from the traditional chatbot use case. It can deliver throughput more than 3x higher than leading engines like vLLM and SGLang on certain benchmarks.

For small models, Tokasaurus minimizes CPU overhead using a dual strategy of asynchronous and adaptive task management. This approach not only prepares inputs more swiftly but also dynamically identifies shared prefixes to optimize attention computation, achieved through a novel algorithmic implementation of Hydragen.

When dealing with larger models, Tokasaurus stands out by supporting asynchronous tensor parallelism on NVLink-equipped GPUs and implementing efficient pipeline parallelism for those without, like Stanford's L40S GPUs. This ensures the system remains robust in environments lacking advanced inter-GPU connectivity.

Interested developers can explore Tokasaurus through the open-source code provided by the team. By addressing both CPU and GPU-related bottlenecks, Tokasaurus sets a new benchmark for throughput-centric LLM inference, potentially revolutionizing how these models support computationally intensive tasks.

### I made a search engine worse than Elasticsearch (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2024/08/06/i-made-search-worse-elasticsearch) | 114 points | by [softwaredoug](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=softwaredoug) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44194468)

Ever tried building a search engine from scratch, only to end up with something, well, less than stellar? A brave developer recently did just that, attempting to create a search library called SearchArray that adds full-text search capabilities to Pandas. The developer, armed with a humble sense of humor and a will to learn, took on the challenge of comparing their creation against the mighty Elasticsearch using the BEIR benchmark and MSMarco Passage Retrieval corpus as the battleground.

Results? Not exactly a David-and-Goliath upset. Elasticsearch outpaced SearchArray on every front. In metrics like NDCG@10 (a measure of relevance), Elasticsearch scored 0.2275 compared to SearchArray's 0.225. When it came to search throughput, Elasticsearch tackled 90 queries per second, leaving SearchArray trailing at 18 QPS. Even in indexing throughput, Elasticsearch maintained a comfortable lead, processing 10K documents per second next to SearchArray's 3.5K.

Despite these sobering figures, the developer isn’t just lamenting their defeat; they’re rolling up their sleeves and diagnosing the issue. The key takeaway? Elasticsearch employs sophisticated algorithms, like WAND (Weak-AND), that give it an edge in search efficiency. This allows Elasticsearch to focus on high-impact, rarer terms like “skywalker” and sift through documents more judiciously, avoiding unnecessary work with common terms.

SearchArray, in contrast, takes a more straightforward and labor-intensive approach, scoring all documents and compiling massive arrays of BM25 scores. It’s a bit like bringing a sledgehammer to a nail – laborious and overkill.

The educational foray into search engine mechanics didn't just highlight the gaps. It underscored the intricacies of how dynamic and optimized real-world search engines like Elasticsearch are, capable of minimizing computations with intelligent indexing and caching strategies, even as they seem to effortlessly handle complex queries.

This developer's journey into the world of search tech, albeit humbling, is a testament to the dedication required to understand and improve upon the sophisticated architectures that underpin the digital tools we often take for granted. So while SearchArray may not yet rival Elasticsearch, it undoubtedly serves as a significant step in a developer's growth and expertise.

The Hacker News discussion around the SearchArray vs. Elasticsearch benchmark highlights several key themes:

1. **Respect for Elasticsearch/Lucene Complexity**:  
   Commenters emphasized that Elasticsearch (built on Lucene) leverages decades of optimization, such as the **WAND algorithm**, efficient indexing, and caching strategies. Replicating even basic features like BM25 scoring is non-trivial, and most DIY implementations only scratch the surface of what Elasticsearch achieves.

2. **Practical Alternatives**:  
   Users suggested simpler solutions for smaller projects:
   - **PostgreSQL’s full-text search** with GIN indexing was praised for being fast and sufficient for many use cases.
   - **Manticoresearch** (a Sphinx fork) was noted for its speed and lighter footprint compared to Elasticsearch, though it lacks some ecosystem integrations.
   - Lightweight tools like **Qrylight** (Kotlin-based) were mentioned for embedded or browser-based applications.

3. **Educational Value vs. Practicality**:  
   While building a search engine from scratch is seen as a valuable learning experience, many argued it’s rarely practical for production. One user quipped, *"Implementing 1% of Lucene’s features takes 99% of the effort."*

4. **Elasticsearch Criticisms**:  
   Some criticized Elasticsearch’s resource-heavy JVM architecture and complexity, calling it overkill for small projects. Others noted that simpler setups (e.g., SQLite for local indexing) often suffice for basic search needs.

5. **Humility and Humor**:  
   The thread balanced admiration for Elasticsearch’s engineering with self-deprecating humor. One user joked, *"If Alphabet’s search engine is worse than Elasticsearch, that’s a problem,"* while others acknowledged the "humbling" journey of tackling search engine design.

**Takeaway**: The consensus leans toward using established tools like Elasticsearch or PostgreSQL for most real-world applications, reserving custom implementations for niche cases or educational exploration. The discussion underscores the gap between theoretical understanding and the polished efficiency of mature systems.

### From tokens to thoughts: How LLMs and humans trade compression for meaning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) | 118 points | by [ggirelli](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ggirelli) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44189426)

A fresh perspective on how humans and large language models (LLMs) process information has recently emerged from a fascinating study titled "From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning." Spearheaded by Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, this research probes the intersection of semantic compression and meaning—a cognitive feat humans perform naturally. The study employs an innovative framework inspired by Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to compare human and LLM strategies.

Humans instinctively categorize information, compressing it while preserving meaning, like identifying a robin and blue jay as birds despite their differences. LLMs boast impressive linguistic abilities but reveal key distinctions from human cognition. The study concludes that while LLMs can form broad categories aligning with human judgments, they miss the nuanced semantic subtleties crucial for human understanding. An even more striking difference is their tendency for aggressive statistical compression, often at the cost of contextual richness.

The findings suggest that LLMs may benefit from adopting more human-like strategies that balance compression with nuance. As AI developers seek pathways to refine LLMs, these insights offer a roadmap toward more human-centric AI models, highlighting the gap in cognitive architectures and the potential for harmonious blending of LLM capability with human-like comprehension.

The Hacker News discussion on the study comparing human and LLM information processing reveals several key themes and critiques:

### **1. Methodological Concerns**  
- **Embedding Validity**: Users debate the paper’s use of token-level embeddings and intermediate representations (e.g., `vln` questions whether analyzing token embeddings directly aligns with human judgments). Critics argue that stripping away contextual nuances (e.g., single-word analysis vs. full-sentence processing) risks oversimplification.  
- **Model Size vs. Performance**: Participants (e.g., `boroboro4`) question whether model size correlates meaningfully with "alignment" to human cognition. Larger models may prioritize statistical compression over nuanced meaning.  

### **2. Semantic vs. Statistical Priorities**  
- Skeptics (e.g., `johnnyApplePRNG`) frame LLMs as “statistical tools” optimized for prediction, with their architecture inherently tied to loss minimization. Others counter that statistical accuracy and problem-solving sophistication aren’t mutually exclusive (`Nevermark`).  

### **3. Linguistic Nuances**  
- A subthread explores challenges in cross-linguistic alignment (`fsndvct`, `blfrbrnd`), such as translating rhymes (e.g., Dutch Sinterklaas poems to English) or culturally loaded terms (e.g., Chinese political satire like *Grass Mud Horse*). This highlights inconsistencies in LLMs’ handling of polysemy and cultural context.  

### **4. Broader Skepticism**  
- Some dismiss the study as incomplete or misleading (`catchnear4321`), while others reference debates like LLMs as “stochastic parrots” (`xwt`), underscoring unresolved questions about whether LLMs truly *understand* language or merely mimic patterns.  

### **5. Meta-Commentary**  
- Yann LeCun’s involvement draws surprise (`dnlbln`), reflecting his historical critiques of transformer models. The discussion occasionally veers into political/cultural references (e.g., Chinese censorship), illustrating how technical debates often intersect with broader societal issues.  

### **Takeaway**  
The thread captures a mix of technical critiques (methodology, model architecture) and philosophical debates (meaning vs. compression), with skepticism about whether current LLMs can ever replicate human-like semantic understanding. Linguistic and cultural examples serve as grounding points for broader concerns about AI’s limitations.

#### [Submission URL](https://seve.blog/p/i-made-a-3d-svg-renderer-that-projects) | 203 points | by [seveibar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=seveibar) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44187645)

In the creative and technical world of rendering, Severin Ibarluzea's latest blog post unveils a nifty approach to using SVGs for 3D rendering without the need for rasterization. Severin delves into creating a 3D object-to-SVG renderer using Typescript, aimed at efficiently visualizing circuit boards crafted in React. The challenge lies in SVGs' lack of native support for perspective transformations, as they only accommodate simpler affine transformations.

To tackle this, Severin explored several strategies, ultimately landing on a method that subdivides the image and applies localized affine transformations, using projected polygon clip paths to manage image edges. This innovative technique allows for convincing 3D projections, illustrated in a detailed walkthrough in the post. Incremental subdivision enhances texture fidelity, and at around 512 images, a convincing perspective is achieved without significantly bloated SVG sizes, thanks to clever use of SVG `defs`.

Severin shares their enthusiasm for refining this renderer to benefit projects like tscircuit, enabling more intuitive version control for circuit boards on platforms like GitHub. This detailed exploration captures the intersection of computational geometry and practicality, pushing forward how we think about lightweight vector graphics in 3D spaces.

Readers interested in the technical implementation can dive into the full source code provided, offering a glimpse into the meticulous process of matrix calculations and image subdivisions. The post also acknowledges contributions from the Hacker News community in refining the project's finer details. A must-read for tech enthusiasts keen on SVGs or modern rendering techniques!

### Reproducing the deep double descent paper

#### [Submission URL](https://stpn.bearblog.dev/reproducing-double-descent/) | 15 points | by [stpn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stpn) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44194431)

In a fascinating journey of hands-on learning, a determined student dives into the world of machine learning with a focus on reproducing the results of a landmark paper on Deep Double Descent. This intriguing concept challenges the long-held belief that model performance peaks and then declines as model size increases. Instead, the paper reveals that after an initial decline, larger models can eventually improve significantly—a phenomenon dubbed "double descent."

Our protagonist, a newcomer to machine learning, embarks on this project at the Recurse Center, armed with freshly acquired knowledge and a desire to understand the nuances of model behavior. With their sights set on part of the Deep Double Descent paper, they hone in on reproducing experiments involving ResNet18 models—particularly those trained with varied sizes and levels of label noise.

The crux of the exploration lies in understanding how machine learning models, when adjusting for size, balance performance between training and test datasets. Models initially perform better with more parameters (entering the underparameterized zone), but then tend to overfit as they become large enough to memorize training solutions. Interestingly, as models grow even larger, they find equilibrium, showcasing strong test set performance once more.

With a mix of intuition and practical adjustments, such as modifying the ResNet18 architecture to accommodate the smaller CIFAR-10 dataset, the student navigates through a host of challenges. This includes combatting limitations of pretrained models in libraries like torchvision and adjusting the model’s architecture to align with the experiment’s needs—specifically, accommodating changes dictated by the varying parameter 'k.'

Despite the struggles and a few deviations, including relying on existing resources to overcome technical hurdles, this journey underscores a critical learning path in machine learning: the blend of theoretical grounding with practical application.

The author shares their tentative findings and reflections, stressing that their understanding continues to evolve. This narrative is not only a testament to the intricate workings of machine learning models but also a reminder of the joys and trials of learning through direct experimentation. For those curious, the project’s code and detailed efforts are accessible on GitHub, inviting collaborative feedback and exploration from the broader community.

The Hacker News discussion on the Deep Double Descent phenomenon explores factors influencing why larger models can recover performance after initial overfitting. Key points include:

1. **Regularization and Model Capacity**: Adjusting regularization may mitigate overfitting, with suggestions that beyond the "interpolation threshold" (where models fit training data perfectly), increasing model size with regularization can aid generalization.

2. **Training Dynamics**: Extended training and gradient behavior are critical. One user observed that despite small effective step sizes, larger models avoid vanishing gradients and eventually converge better than smaller ones, even with noisy datasets (e.g., CIFAR-10 with 10% label noise). This challenges intuitions that larger models should underperform due to complexity.

3. **Local Minima and Generalization**: Larger models might escape local minima that trap smaller models, leveraging their capacity to find solutions that generalize better. Empirical checks (e.g., gradient histograms) showed gradients remained stable, suggesting training dynamics in larger networks remain viable.

4. **Noise and Dataset Effects**: Experiments with label noise highlighted how model performance fluctuates with size, supporting the double descent curve. Users debated theoretical explanations (e.g., linear models vs. deep networks) and practical observations, emphasizing the interplay between theory and experimentation.

The discussion underscores ongoing exploration into balancing theoretical insights (e.g., interpolation thresholds, regularization) with empirical training behavior to explain why increasing model size can paradoxically enhance generalization after initial decline.

### Show HN: Open a browser by clapping twice (inspired by Iron Man)

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Yutarop/two_claps_open) | 9 points | by [ponta17](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ponta17) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44189962)

Ever wished you could control your computer like Tony Stark in Iron Man? You're in luck! A new project, "two_claps_open," now lets you open applications like Google Chrome or activate a voice assistant with just two claps. Developed by Yutarop, this innovative program cleverly identifies clapping sounds through audio analysis and then uses their distinct frequency to trigger specific actions.

The tech behind this feat is fascinating. By recording a sample clap and performing a Fourier transform, the developer pinpointed the frequency range where most of the clap's energy lies—about 1.4kHz to 1.8kHz. A bandpass filter then isolates this range from background noise, and peak detection identifies the claps in real time. Spot two claps in quick succession, and presto—your designated app springs into action.

For tech enthusiasts eager to test it out, the project consists of Python scripts that make use of popular libraries such as NumPy, PyAudio, and SciPy. There are also additional dependencies for those wanting to pair clap detection with voice assistant features, including SpeechRecognition and Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS). Remember to configure your Google API key as the project suggests using a free tier for access.

Dive into this Tony Stark-like experience with "two_claps_open" and turn your casual claps into commands with this exciting open-source venture. Clap on, tech heroes!

The Hacker News discussion around the "two_claps_open" project highlights creative applications and extensions of clap-based automation. Key points include:  

1. **Integration Suggestions**: A user humorously hints at training a model for *Home Assistant* (possibly via a typo-heavy quip: *"prbbly nhncd trnng tmtn Home Assistant"*), suggesting interest in home automation integration.  

2. **Alternative Use Cases**: Another user shares a practical example of using audio detection beyond claps—**monitoring UPS beeps** to detect power outages. They describe a setup where software listens for UPS alerts, triggers actions (like app closures) during electricity loss, and praises the flexibility of combining such systems with clap detection.  

3. **Community Engagement**: Others express enthusiasm for merging clap-triggered commands with hardware monitoring, calling it a *"great idea"* they hadn’t considered before.  

The discussion reflects excitement for repurposing the project’s audio-analysis approach into broader automation workflows, from smart homes to system fail-safes.
