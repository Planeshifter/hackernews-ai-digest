### LLMs are cheap

#### [Submission URL](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2025-06-02-llms-are-cheap/) | 326 points | by [Bogdanp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bogdanp) | [302 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44223448)

In his latest blog post titled "LLMs are cheap," Juho Snellman challenges the common belief that generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are prohibitively expensive to operate. This misconception, Snellman argues, leads to flawed analyses of AI companies’ business viability and a narrow view of potential monetization strategies for consumer AI businesses. Initially, as AI took off, inference costs were high, but they've since plummeted, with some implying a 1000x reduction over two years—an extraordinary decrease hard to intuitively grasp.

Snellman compares LLMs to web search to underscore this point. Public API pricing for web searches with big players like Google and Bing ranges from $5 to $35 per 1,000 queries. Meanwhile, LLMs from various models, such as Gemini and GPT, exhibit a similar pricing structure per 1,000 tokens—essentially aligning with search engine costs. Intriguingly, certain LLM models are far cheaper, costing only $0.20 per 1,000 tokens, lower than even the cheapest search API.

The post acknowledges potential objections to Snellman's cost comparison, admitting that adjusting assumptions could impact the analysis. However, the core takeaway remains that LLMs, now more efficient than ever, rival or undercut the cost of traditional web searches, suggesting that the notion of prohibitively high LLM costs needs reevaluation. Despite critiques about subsidizing current LLM pricing to capture market share, Snellman argues that LLM operations are inherently less expensive than perceived—a hidden aspect that AI skeptics often overlook.

The Hacker News discussion on Juho Snellman's argument that "LLMs are cheap" highlights skepticism and nuanced critiques of the cost comparison between LLMs and traditional web search APIs. Key points from the debate include:

1. **Cost Structure and Subsidies**:  
   Commenters question whether LLM costs are genuinely low or artificially suppressed by cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure, which may subsidize inference costs to capture market share. Comparisons are drawn to loss-leading strategies (e.g., Costco’s $5 chickens) and historical tech practices (e.g., AWS’s early pricing tactics). Critics argue that current pricing might not reflect true operational costs, especially as GPU infrastructure, depreciation, and power consumption add hidden expenses.

2. **Training vs. Inference Costs**:  
   While inference is cited as cheap, training models remains prohibitively expensive, with some noting OpenAI’s reported heavy losses. The discussion highlights the risks of model obsolescence, likening outdated LLMs to archaic software like Windows 2000, where sunk costs and integration challenges trap users in inefficient systems.

3. **Business Model Viability**:  
   Skepticism persists about the profitability of consumer AI services, particularly at scale. Subscriptions (e.g., ChatGPT’s $20/month tier) are viewed as potentially unsustainable without price hikes, mirroring critiques of early tech growth strategies. Others compare LLMs to foundational web technologies (TCP/IP, HTML), arguing long-term success hinges on integration into broader systems rather than standalone "killer apps."

4. **Technical and Accounting Nuances**:  
   Debates arise over Capex vs. Opex for GPUs, tax implications, and whether cloud providers’ accounting obscures true profitability. Technical optimizations (e.g., token generation efficiency) are noted, but their real-world impact on costs is contested.

5. **Market Dynamics**:  
   Some predict a shakeout as the LLM market matures, with commoditization and consolidation likely. Others warn against overestimating LLMs’ current utility, urging caution in equating them with transformative platforms like the early web.

In summary, while Snellman’s cost comparisons are acknowledged, the discussion underscores unresolved questions about long-term economics, hidden subsidies, and the feasibility of monetizing LLMs at scale. The debate reflects broader tensions between optimism about AI's potential and skepticism of its near-term profitability.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/) | 93 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44225988)

Imagine being tricked into buying a lousy CD player when you thought you were too smart for that. Baldur Bjarnason shares how reading Robert Cialdini’s *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* was his eye-opener. The book's insights into the vulnerabilities of human reasoning were like a cold shower for his teenage arrogance. It made clear that intelligence alone couldn’t protect from psychological traps and manipulative sales tactics.

Fast forward to the age of artificial intelligence, and Bjarnason sees similar cognitive hazards at play. He points to a recent experiment by a CloudFlare engineer, initially skeptical of AI, who was astoundingly impressed by the surprisingly competent code generated by an AI while creating an authentication library. This is where things get interesting: while the engineer’s anecdote about AI's capabilities is intriguing, Bjarnason argues it's at best gossip, not scientific proof.

In the wider context of software development, he warns that many developers enthusiastically take such anecdotes as evidence without rigorous scrutiny. This mentality has echoes in the debate over the adoption of technologies like TypeScript, where decisions often hinge more on personal or anecdotal experiences than robust research.

Ultimately, Bjarnason emphasizes that while gossip-driven decisions in tech, like choosing TypeScript over JavaScript, may seem harmless, treating AI with a similar casual approach is risky. The stakes are much higher when AI's integration influences critical systems. So, his message is clear: trust in your judgment is fine, but don’t let it substitute for thorough, evidence-based evaluation—especially when it comes to the dynamic and potentially deceptive world of AI.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward anecdotal evidence in tech decisions, particularly regarding TypeScript’s benefits and AI’s role in software development. Key points include:

1. **TypeScript Debate**:  
   - Critics argue that claims about TypeScript’s productivity and correctness often rely on personal anecdotes rather than rigorous research. Some point to academic studies showing mixed or inconclusive results, while others highlight real-world benefits like enhanced IDE tooling (e.g., LSP integration) and reduced runtime errors.  
   - A subthread notes that TypeScript’s static typing formalizes distrust in human intuition, forcing developers to validate assumptions upfront—a contrast to JavaScript’s "YOLO" approach.  

2. **AI and Anecdotal Evidence**:  
   - Many express concern about overhyped AI success stories, like the CloudFlare engineer’s example. Critics argue such anecdotes risk normalizing unverified claims, akin to past debates over TypeScript adoption.  
   - Security flaws in AI-generated code (e.g., OAuth redirect bugs) spark debate: some blame AI’s limitations, while others stress human reviewers’ responsibility.  

3. **Research vs. Anecdotes**:  
   - Participants emphasize the lack of robust empirical research in software practices. Studies on TDD, Copilot, and static typing are cited as flawed or industry-specific (e.g., Google’s internal data), raising questions about generalizability.  
   - A recurring theme: tech decisions often prioritize personal experience or corporate influence (e.g., Microsoft’s promotion of Copilot) over peer-reviewed evidence.  

4. **Long-Term Risks of AI**:  
   - Skeptics warn that LLMs might accelerate "shoddy" code production, increasing systemic complexity and technical debt. Others counter that AI could democratize development but concede its impact on software quality remains unproven.  

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores a demand for scientific rigor in evaluating tools like TypeScript and AI, cautioning against conflating anecdotal wins with broader validity. The community stresses balancing experimentation with critical scrutiny, especially in high-stakes domains.

   Many emphasized that AI tools like LLMs (Large Language Models) are most effective when paired with human oversight. For example, one user noted that AI can assist with drafting, SEO optimization, or transcribing interviews but should not replace editorial judgment. Others compared AI-generated content to "posting top Google search results with commentary"—useful as a starting point but insufficient on its own.

3. **Concerns About Content Pollution**:  
   Participants worried that AI-generated content could flood the web, degrading search quality and creating a feedback loop where AI trains on AI-generated data. This mirrors past issues with SEO spam, where quantity often overshadows quality. Some predicted a future where the web becomes a "zombie ecosystem" dominated by AI content.

4. **Philosophical and Historical Parallels**:  
   A sub-thread referenced Socrates’ skepticism of written language (via Plato’s *Phaedrus*), drawing parallels to modern debates about AI’s impact on communication. Critics argued that LLMs exacerbate confirmation bias and lack the nuance of human dialogue.

5. **Practical Use Cases and Optimism**:  
   A few users shared positive experiences with AI tools for tasks like generating marketing copy or technical documentation, stressing the importance of human validation and iterative refinement. For example, one commenter highlighted using AI to draft SaaS website content, followed by rigorous testing and editing.

6. **The Role of Platforms and Moderation**:
