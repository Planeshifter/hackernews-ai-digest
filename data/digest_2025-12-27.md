Apple open-sources SHARP: single-image to 3D Gaussian scenes in under a second

- What it is: SHARP takes a single photo and directly regresses a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) scene that can be rendered in real time for nearby viewpoints. The representation is metric (with absolute scale), enabling physically meaningful camera motions.

- Why it matters: Prior photorealistic view synthesis typically needed multi-view capture and/or lengthy optimization (e.g., NeRF-style training). SHARP claims state-of-the-art quality with massive speedups: LPIPS down 25–34% and DISTS down 21–43% vs. prior best, while cutting synthesis time by roughly three orders of magnitude. The authors also report robust zero-shot generalization across datasets.

- How it works for users:
  - One-pass inference on a standard GPU in <1s; outputs 3DGS .ply files compatible with common Gaussian renderers.
  - CLI: sharp predict -i /path/to/images -o /path/to/gaussians
  - Model downloads automatically to ~/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/ or via direct link.
  - Prediction runs on CPU, CUDA, and Apple MPS; video rendering along trajectories (--render) currently requires a CUDA GPU (first run initializes gsplat and can be slow).
  - Coordinates follow OpenCV (x right, y down, z forward). You may need to re-center/scale when using third‑party renderers.

- Practical notes:
  - Python env suggested (e.g., conda); requirements provided.
  - Code and model have separate licenses; check LICENSE and LICENSE_MODEL.

Potential impact: Single-image, real-time 3D scene synthesis could accelerate AR/VR previews, robotics perception, and creative tools, while further cementing 3D Gaussian splats as a fast, deployable alternative to optimization-heavy NeRF pipelines.

Based on the discussion, here is the summary:

**Licensing and Definition of "Open Source"**
The primary point of contention in the thread is the use of the term "Open Source" in the submission title. Users point out that while the source code is under the permissive MIT license, the model weights themselves carry a restrictive "Research Use Only" (or non-commercial) license.
*   Commenters argue this continues a trend—popularized by companies like Meta—of "open washing," where "Open Source" is conflated with simply releasing weights, diluting the term's connection to Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) definitions.
*   Critiques suggest this hybrid licensing prevents community adoption and commercial integration.

**Legal Theory: Copyright and Liability**
A significant debate emerged regarding legality and strategy:
*   **Copyrightability:** Users debated whether model weights (tables of numbers) are legally copyrightable or if they are simply facts/mathematical outputs. Some argued they represent creative expression, while others insisted they are unprotectable data.
*   **Strategic Shielding:** Several users speculated that Apple’s restrictive licensing isn't necessarily about protecting the model, but rather a legal tactic to avoid liability. By restricting commercial use, Apple may be sidestepping scrutiny regarding the copyright status of the data used to *train* the model.
*   **Enforcement:** Regardless of actual legality, commenters noted that the threat of litigation from a entity as large as Apple effectively enforces the license, as few can afford to challenge it in court.

**Impact and Usability**
*   **Strategic Folly:** One user argued that by restricting the model, Apple is essentially encouraging competitors (specifically citing Chinese AI researchers) to replicate the functionality and release their own versions, ultimately causing Apple to lose control of the standard.
*   **Developer Experience:** There was a brief exchange regarding usability; while one user expressed frustration that AI repositories rarely contain working instructions, another reporter countered that the SHARP instructions worked fine for them.
*   **True Openness:** Ideally, users argued, a truly "Open Source" AI release must include the training data, not just the code and weights.

### More than 20% of videos shown to new YouTube users are 'AI slop', study finds

More than 20% of videos shown to new YouTube users are ‘AI slop’, study finds

- A Kapwing study of 15,000 top YouTube channels (top 100 per country) found 278 publish only “AI slop” — low-effort, AI-generated clips optimized for clicks. Collectively: 63B views, 221M subscribers, and an estimated $117M/year in revenue.
- In a fresh account test, 104 of the first 500 recommended videos (≈21%) were AI slop; one-third of the feed was “brainrot” (a broader bucket of low-quality, attention-farming content).
- Growth is global: Kapwing tallies AI-channel followings of 20M in Spain, 18M in Egypt, 14.5M in the US, and 13.5M in Brazil.
- Standout channels:
  - Bandar Apna Dost (India): 2.4B views; surreal action vignettes; estimated up to $4.25M revenue.
  - Pouty Frenchie (Singapore): 2B views; kid-targeted bulldog adventures; ~+$4M/year.
  - Cuentos Facinantes (US): 6.65M subscribers; children’s cartoon storylines.
  - The AI World (Pakistan): 1.3B views; AI-generated disaster shorts.
- Behind the scenes: informal playbooks spread on Telegram/WhatsApp/Discord; “niches” like AI videos of pressure cookers exploding; many creators come from middle‑income countries (e.g., India, Kenya, Nigeria, Brazil, Vietnam, Ukraine). Course-sellers often profit more than creators.
- Big picture: platforms function as vast A/B testing systems, rewarding whatever hooks engagement and can be scaled. The actual share of total YouTube views from AI content remains unclear due to limited platform disclosure.
- YouTube’s response: generative AI is just a tool; the company says it focuses on surfacing high-quality content regardless of how it’s made.

**Is YouTube a Library or a Trap?**
A debate emerged regarding the fundamental nature of the platform. While **scotty79** defended YouTube as an "amazing repository" of practical skills and knowledge on par with Wikipedia, **DoctorOW** and others argued the business model fundamentally breaks the utility. They noted that while Wikipedia is donor-funded to provide comprehensive information, YouTube is incentivized to sell influence and manipulate users via algorithms, making the comparison to traditional mass media unfavorable.

**The Impact on Children**
Much of the discussion focused on the "brainrot" mentioned in the article:
*   **The_President** described the platform not as a "mistake" but as engineered addiction, characterizing it as a "drug" for children that parents use as a pacifier.
*   **Glkk** detailed the bizarre nature of the "slop" targeting kids—listing surreal examples like Sonic or Lego characters in weird scenarios—and argued that the only safe approach is to curate and download videos in advance rather than trusting the feed.

**Creators vs. The Algorithm**
Commenters contrasted the treatment of human creators with AI content. **Trnm** noted that YouTube harshly penalizes real creators with demonetization and copyright strikes for minor infractions, yet allows AI slop to run rampant. **Blbbl** speculated this might be the "end game": replacing pesky, expensive human creators with AI entirely.

**Archival Concerns**
**Brndyn** argued that YouTube’s hostility toward downloaders is a "crime against humanity," preventing the public from archiving a massive cultural history (unlike Wikipedia), leaving valuable content from deceased creators or defunct channels at risk of deletion.
