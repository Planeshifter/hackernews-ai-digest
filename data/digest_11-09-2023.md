The team at Mentat recently conducted a benchmark test to compare the performance of GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo in editing code. The goal was to determine if GPT-4 Turbo, which is cheaper and has a larger context, could match the quality of GPT-4. 

Using a set of 122 Exercism programming exercises, they ran both models and found that GPT-4 solved 86 of the exercises while GPT-4 Turbo solved 84. Although GPT-4 Turbo performed slightly worse, it was a close result that could be attributed to statistical noise. However, upon closer examination, they discovered a significant difference between the two models.

GPT-4 solved 76 exercises on the first try and an additional 10 on the second try, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 56 on the first try and an additional 28 on the second try. This led the team to investigate why GPT-4 Turbo had a lower success rate on the first attempt.

They found that GPT-4 Turbo often wrote reasonable solutions but failed due to unclear or ambiguous instructions. On the other hand, GPT-4 seemed to have memorized the Exercism training tasks, allowing it to solve them more easily. This led the team to believe that when GPT-4 was downsized to create GPT-4 Turbo, it lost some of this memorization capability.

To test this theory, the team reran the benchmark without showing the models the instructions for each exercise. Instead, they only provided the exercise names and function stubs. GPT-4 solved 23 of the 40 exercises, while GPT-4 Turbo only solved 12. This confirmed their theory that GPT-4 had more of the exercises memorized than GPT-4 Turbo.

These results highlight the importance of better benchmarks for evaluating models trained on separate datasets or distilled models like GPT-4 Turbo. The team at Mentat is already working on building real-world coding tasks based on recent commits to open source repositories as a more accurate gauge of model accuracy in the future.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of the benchmark results and the implications of the findings. 

One commenter points out that the test conducted for the benchmark is limited to a relatively small number of questions, and suggests that better benchmarks would involve a larger number of diversified questions. Another commenter discusses the limitations of the GPT-4 Turbo model, stating that although it may have lower performance, it is still able to solve coding problems reasonably well. 

There is some discussion about the attribution of the benchmarks, with one commenter suggesting that proper attribution is needed while another questions why people seem concerned about plagiarism in software development. 

There is also discussion about the size and context of the models, with one commenter questioning why certain changes were made to the sizes of the models in GPT-4 Turbo. Another commenter suggests that the prompt-processed tokens are slower and more expensive than the top tokens, and that OpenAI's pricing structure is based on this expectation.

Some commenters express skepticism about the benchmark results and argue that conclusions should not be drawn from such limited data. Others discuss the difference in performance between GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo, specifically in identifying assumptions and correctly solving mathematical problems.

There are also discussions about the importance of memorization in learning and problem-solving, and how humans and AI algorithms rely on memorization as a foundation for higher reasoning.

Overall, the discussion covers various perspectives on the benchmark results, the limitations of the models, and the challenges in evaluating AI models for coding tasks.

Mozilla has launched Fakespot Chat, an AI agent that helps consumers shop online by answering questions about products. Fakespot, which was acquired by Mozilla earlier this year, uses AI and machine learning to identify fake and deceptive product reviews. Fakespot Chat aims to combat the problem of fake reviews, which are increasingly being generated using AI technology. The chatbot uses AI and machine learning to sort through product reviews, separating real from fake, and provides users with accurate information to make informed purchase decisions. The chatbot is available through the Fakespot Analyzer or as a browser extension on Amazon.com. Mozilla aims to reduce consumers' product research time and lead them to better purchasing decisions with Fakespot Chat.

The discussion on the submission primarily revolves around privacy concerns related to Fakespot. One user, "smsmshh," shares a link to Fakespot's privacy policy, highlighting a section that outlines the personal information collected by the service. They express dismay over the amount of personal data being collected automatically, including contact information, identifiers, device information, usage data, location information, and publicly available information.

In response, another user, "m463," wonders about the relevance of this information to non-intrusive chat systems, suggesting that Fakespot's data collection practices seem excessive.

On a lighter note, user "skhnrd" expresses gratitude and happiness for the regular updates, appreciating the sharing of information.

User "tklsh" briefly comments, simply saying "dd."

OpenAI has announced a new initiative called OpenAI Data Partnerships, where they will collaborate with organizations to create public and private datasets for training AI models. The goal is to make AI models more comprehensive and better understand various subject matters, industries, cultures, and languages. OpenAI has already partnered with organizations like the Icelandic Government and the Free Law Project to improve AI models' knowledge in specific domains. They are now seeking more partners who want to contribute to AI research and benefit from models that are tailored to their needs. OpenAI is interested in large-scale datasets that reflect human society and are not easily accessible online. They can work with data in different modalities such as text, images, audio, or video, and they have in-house tools to help digitize and structure data. OpenAI is looking for both open-source partnerships to create publicly available datasets and private partnerships to train proprietary AI models. The focus is on developing AI technology that is safe, beneficial, and useful to all of humanity.

The discussion on this submission revolves around different aspects of OpenAI's new initiative and its implications.

- One commenter suggests that OpenAI should not provide its models to the Chinese government because it could give them an unfair advantage over private companies. Another person counters this by mentioning the issue of mass surveillance in China and how the US government already has control over much of the world.

- There is a debate about whether OpenAI should accept private training data without proper permission or attribution. Some argue that copyright laws are essential for protecting the rights of creators, while others mention the costs and limitations of enforcing copyright and the potential benefits of allowing AIs equivalent rights to read as humans.

- One commenter jokingly says "FEED ME" in response to OpenAI's data partnerships, emphasizing the importance of input.

- The sensitivity of personal information in datasets and OpenAI's careful generation of written materials are discussed. One person expresses that OpenAI's technology is impressive in generating coherent sentences that reflect a particular style of writing.

- The cost and impact of training data on AI models are mentioned, with a suggestion that OpenAI could monetize the training datasets it releases in the future.

- Someone comments that OpenAI's collaboration with other organizations will be valuable for creating datasets and improving AI technology.

- Finally, there is one comment about someone trying to build themselves up.

### A robot in South Korea mistook a man for a box of vegetables and killed him

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-67354709) | 74 points | by [lando2319](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lando2319) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38209282)

In a tragic incident in South Korea, a man was crushed to death by a robot after it mistook him for a box of food it was handling. The man, an employee of a robotics company, was inspecting the robot when the robotic arm grabbed him and pushed him against a conveyor belt, causing fatal injuries. The robot was responsible for lifting boxes of peppers and transferring them onto pallets. This incident highlights the importance of establishing precise and safe systems while working with robots. It also serves as a reminder of the potential dangers involved in the growing field of robotics and automation.

Discussion:

- Isamu comments that while the headlines may suggest that the robot was acting on its own, the reality is that it was a human error. Human operators are responsible for the safety and control of robots.

- PH95VuimJjqBqy suggests that there may have been a failure in the safety protocols.

- MisterTea argues that proper safety measures, like fencing and safety sensors, should have been in place to prevent such accidents. They also mention that commissioning systems can be risky if not done properly.
