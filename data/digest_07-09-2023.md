### New York Cityâ€™s AI hiring law takes effect

#### [Submission URL](https://qz.com/americas-first-law-regulating-ai-bias-in-hiring-takes-e-1850602243) | 99 points | by [donohoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=donohoe) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36654420)

New York City is set to enforce a groundbreaking law aimed at tackling bias in AI hiring tools. The law, first passed in 2021, requires employers to be transparent about their use of AI and algorithmic-based tools in the hiring process. Companies must inform candidates of their use of such tools and disclose what personal data is being collected. Additionally, the law mandates that companies undergo annual audits to identify potential bias within their AI systems. While the law is a step towards transparency, critics argue that it may not go far enough in protecting job candidates from bias. They argue that developers can find loopholes to pass or bypass audits, rendering them less effective in detecting bias. Nonetheless, the enforcement of this law is a significant move towards promoting fairness and accountability in the AI hiring process.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to AI hiring tools and the enforcement of the new law in New York City. Here are some key points from the comments:

1. Some users raise concerns about the potential for bias in AI-based hiring tools. They mention that social media scrapers collect personal data from applicants, AI-based chatbots ask candidates questions, and algorithmic video platforms analyze facial expressions and other subjective traits. There is a debate about the effectiveness of audits in detecting biases, as developers can potentially find loopholes to pass or bypass them.

2. One user mentions their negative experience with a startup company and argues that transparency regulations are necessary. They also express disappointment in weak regulations and hope for rewriting corporate candidate rights and question requirements.

3. Another user criticizes the repetitive and lengthy interview process in larger companies, suggesting that it doesn't work effectively and is not widely adopted.

4. Some users diverge from the topic, discussing issues such as the corruption of identity politics in regulations, the difficulty of detecting meaningful variables for machine learning algorithms, and the bias inherent in job application processes.

5. A user argues that the problem lies in the training data used for machine learning models, pointing out that black candidates are often worse off due to historically biased recruitment practices.

6. There are also comments about the removal of human touch from hiring processes and the challenges faced by job applicants in navigating the process.

Overall, the discussion explores concerns about bias, the limitations of AI tools, the need for transparency, and the challenges faced in the hiring process.
