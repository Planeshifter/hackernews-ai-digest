#### [Submission URL](https://robopen.github.io/) | 132 points | by [reqo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reqo) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37167698)

Introducing RoboAgent: A Universal Robotic Agent with 12 Skills

The quest for a single robot that can manipulate any object in diverse settings has been a distant goal for decades. However, the lack of diverse robotics datasets and generic agents capable of generating such datasets has hindered progress. Enter RoboAgent, a universal robotic agent developed by a team at Carnegie Mellon University and Meta AI.

RoboAgent is a culmination of two years of work and aims to efficiently acquire multiple skills within a practical data budget and generalize them to unseen situations. The team built RoboPen, a distributed robotics infrastructure, and RoboHive, a framework for robot learning across simulation and real-world operations. They also created RoboSet, a high-quality dataset representing multiple skills with everyday objects in diverse scenarios.

To tackle the challenge of low-data regimes and overfitting, the team employed an efficient language conditioned multi-task offline imitation learning framework called MT-ACT. They used semantic augmentations to inject world priors from existing foundation models into the RoboSet dataset, creating a heavily multi-modal dataset with a rich diversity of skills, tasks, and scenarios. They then developed MT-ACT, a novel efficient policy representation that can handle this multi-modal dataset while avoiding overfitting.

RoboAgent was trained on just 7,500 trajectories, a fraction of the data used by previous methods, yet it exhibited 12 non-trivial manipulation skills across 38 tasks and could generalize to hundreds of diverse unseen scenarios. It even showed the ability to evolve its capabilities with new experiences.

The team also released the RoboSet dataset, consisting of 100,050 trajectories, and open-sourced their entire dataset to accelerate research in robot-learning. With RoboAgent's sample efficiency and ability to generalize, the dream of a universal robotic agent may be within reach.

The discussion on this submission begins with users commenting on the 12 skills that RoboAgent has learned. One user points out that there are skills beyond the 12 mentioned in the article. Another user jokingly adds "computer hacking skills" to the list. 

There are later comments discussing the related research paper "RT-2" and its comparison to "RT-1." 

One user criticizes the presentation format of the article, finding it somewhat contradictory and lacking in clarity.

A couple of comments question the purpose of RoboAgent and its skills. One user sarcastically states that it is a "battery god" while another user expresses their wish for 12 skills.

The discussion then shifts to comparing RoboAgent's achievements to those of Boston Dynamics. Some users express enthusiasm for the advancements in robotics, while others bring up the use of classical versus deep learning techniques and the need for AI to intersect with robotics.

There is a discussion about the comments section in general, with some users stating that negative comments are discouraging and hinder progress. A user adds that Boston Dynamics largely uses classical learning techniques and that AI research needs to focus on creating practical and usable results.

Other comments mention finding Boston Dynamics' GitHub resources and note that Boston Dynamics' robots perform tasks in a pre-programmed manner.

The discussion ends with one user praising Boston Dynamics' robots and their impressive abilities.

### Future Intel CPUs May Dump Hyper-Threading for Partitioned Thread Scheduling

#### [Submission URL](https://hothardware.com/news/future-intel-cpu-partition-threads) | 50 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163191)

Intel is considering ditching Hyper-Threading in future CPUs in favor of a new technique called partitioned thread scheduling, according to a recently published patent. Hyper-Threading, which is Intel's version of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), aims to improve occupancy and utilization of a processor core's functional units. However, it is not always efficient, as a single program thread rarely fills all of a processor's functional units. The new partitioned thread scheduling technique analyzes the work required by a thread and breaks application threads into segments using partitions. These partitioned threads are then scheduled onto processor cores based on their performance requirements. This technique aims to optimize core utilization and improve overall efficiency.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implications of Intel potentially ditching Hyper-Threading in favor of partitioned thread scheduling. Some users express their skepticism about the performance benefits of Hyper-Threading, citing benchmark tests that showed minimal speed improvements. Others discuss the potential drawbacks of partitioned thread scheduling, such as increased cache misses and the need for software compatibility. 

One user mentions that Intel's Thread Director technology in Alder Lake CPUs may address some of the performance and power consumption issues associated with Hyper-Threading. Another user raises the point that the patent application does not necessarily indicate an imminent replacement of Hyper-Threading but rather suggests a possible alternative scheduling technique.

There is also a discussion about the difference between physical cores and logical cores and how Hyper-Threading fits into this context. Some users argue that physical cores are more important for performance and that SMT can lead to limiting factors and behavior that affect overall efficiency.

Overall, the discussion highlights various perspectives and considerations regarding the potential shift from Hyper-Threading to partitioned thread scheduling in future Intel CPUs.

The New York Times may be considering a lawsuit against OpenAI over alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Times recently updated its terms of service to prohibit AI companies from scraping its articles and images to train AI models. If the Times were to sue OpenAI, it could result in fines of up to $150,000 per infringing piece of content and the destruction of ChatGPT's dataset. This potential lawsuit could become the most high-profile legal battle over copyright protection in the AI industry. OpenAI is already facing legal challenges from popular authors over similar concerns. The Times' main concern is that ChatGPT could use its content to become a competitor by creating text that answers questions based on the original reporting and writing of the paper's staff. The Times had been considering a licensing deal with OpenAI, but meetings between the two parties have reportedly become contentious, making the deal increasingly unlikely. OpenAI would likely have to claim fair use of the web content it scraped to train its models in order to defend itself, but experts believe this would be challenging since ChatGPT could replace the Times' website as a source of its reporting for some users. The Associated Press and other news organizations have also expressed concerns about their material being used by AI companies without permission or payment, and have been developing standards for the use of AI in newsrooms.
