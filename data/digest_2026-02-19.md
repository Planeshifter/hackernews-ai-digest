### AI is not a coworker, it's an exoskeleton

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/ai-as-exoskeleton) | 416 points | by [benbeingbin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benbeingbin) | [412 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078324)

Core idea: Treat AI as an “exoskeleton” that amplifies human judgment, not as an autonomous coworker. Framed this way, AI succeeds by handling scale and surfacing insights while humans make the calls. The post contrasts this with “agentic AI,” which often disappoints because it lacks the implicit context people carry.

Evidence via real exoskeletons:
- Manufacturing: Ford’s EksoVest cut injuries 83%; BMW reports 30–40% reduced effort with Levitate vests; German Bionic’s Cray X supports up to 66 lbs and customers saw 25% fewer sick days.
- Military: Sarcos Guardian XO Max delivers 20:1 strength amplification; Lockheed’s HULC supports ~200 lbs at ~7 mph sustained.
- Rehab: Meta-analysis found 76% of spinal cord injury patients could walk with powered exoskeletons (with crutches/walkers for balance).
- Running: Stanford showed a 15% energy cost reduction with an ankle exo; Harvard’s soft exosuit cut running metabolic cost by 5.4%.

Product application: Kasava positions its platform as an exoskeleton for product teams—deep commit analysis to spot technical debt and risks; large-scale transcript analysis to extract themes and pain points—while leaving prioritization and decisions to humans. The piece argues autonomous agents fail without organizational “connective tissue” (hinting at a “product graph” to encode that context).

Why it matters:
- Practical takeaway: capture and wire up org context; design AI to surface options, not make judgment calls.
- Counterpoint: agents can work in tightly scoped, well-instrumented domains, but broad autonomy still hits context walls.
- HN angle: a clear framing for building AI features users trust—and a reminder that “human-in-the-loop” is a product choice, not a fallback.

**The Debate: Stochastic Parrots vs. Useful Architects**
The discussion focused heavily on the definition of "reasoning" and the practical application of AI in software engineering, moving beyond the article's specific "exoskeleton" metaphor into the mechanics of how AI assists—or hinders—technical work.

*   **The "Architect" vs. The "Team":** One prominent perspective challenged the need for human teams, arguing that human collaboration has high "synchronization costs." This user suggested AI facilitates a shift where a single human "architect" with good taste can direct an "army of agents" or utilize AI for error correction and delegation, effectively acting as a massive lever for individual output.
*   **The Competence Barrier:** Countering the "easy automation" narrative, others likened AI coding to distinct skill levels. One commenter compared unskilled AI usage to a toddler with Play-Doh—making a mess without fundamental structural knowledge—working only when the user is a "competent sculptor" (skilled programmer) who can mold the raw material correctly.
*   **Reasoning vs. Autocomplete:** A heated debate emerged regarding whether LLMs possess true logic or are simply "text predictors."
    *   **Skeptics** noted that models often hallucinate (citing an anecdote about a model reading the clipboard and inventing a scenario) and make "non-human" mistakes, arguing they lack the context to find actual flaws.
    *   **Defenders** argued that if a model successfully navigates messy log files to produce working code fixes, the distinction between "reasoning" and "prediction" is effectively meaningless. One user cited mechanistic interpretability research (specifically regarding Anthropic’s models) to demonstrate that LLMs have specific internal feature representations for "bugs" and "unsafe code," suggesting a deeper internal logic than simple pattern matching.
*   **Human Reliability:** Several comments pushed back against the demand for deterministic AI, pointing out that human reasoning is also probabilistic and unreliable. The argument was made that AI doesn't need to be perfect, but simply needs to outperform the average human's consistency to be valuable, drawing parallels to safety thresholds for self-driving cars.

### Gemini 3.1 Pro

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/) | 902 points | by [MallocVoidstar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MallocVoidstar) | [871 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074735)

Google announces Gemini 3.1 Pro, pushing “core reasoning” and agentic workflows

- What’s new: An upgraded core model meant for complex, multi-step tasks, rolling out across Google’s consumer and developer products.
- Headline claim: Scores 77.1% (verified) on ARC-AGI-2, more than double Gemini 3 Pro’s reasoning performance, per Google.
- Demos/use cases: 
  - Generates website-ready animated SVGs from text.
  - Builds a live ISS telemetry dashboard by wiring a public API to a visualization.
  - Codes an interactive 3D starling murmuration with hand tracking and a generative score.
  - “Creative coding” that translates literary themes (e.g., Wuthering Heights) into site design and behavior.
- Availability: 
  - Developers (preview) via Gemini API in AI Studio, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and Android Studio.
  - Enterprises via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.
  - Consumers via the Gemini app and NotebookLM (Pro/Ultra; higher limits in the app, NotebookLM access limited to Pro/Ultra).
- Context: Follows last week’s “Gemini 3 Deep Think” update; 3.1 Pro is in preview as Google iterates on more ambitious agentic workflows before general availability.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

*   **Claude Remains the Coding Favorite:** A significant portion of the discussion contrasts Gemini unfavorably with Anthropic’s Claude. While users acknowledge Gemini’s raw reasoning speed, developers report getting "stuck in loops" and struggling with poor tooling integration. One former Googler described their current workflow as "Plan in Gemini, Execute in Claude," implying Google has captured the reasoning aspect but Anthropic currently owns the developer experience.
*   **Strategic Focus (OpenAI vs. Anthropic):** Commenters suggest that while Google is busy fighting an existential war against OpenAI to protect Search, they are inadvertently leaving the high-value "enterprise and coding" door open for Anthropic. However, defenders note that Google’s "messy" product launches are typical for the company, and its vertical integration (owning the TPUs and data centers) gives it a long-term economic advantage that competitors reliant on Nvidia chips lack.
*   **Performance & Hallucinations:** User reports on the new model's accuracy are mixed. Some anecdotal evidence suggests the new preview hallucinates more than Gemini 3.0, while others cite benchmarks (like the AA-Omniscience Index) to argue that 3.1 is technically an improvement, leading to a debate on how these benchmarks apply to real-world usage.
*   **Safety & Refusals:** There is conflicting feedback regarding safety filters. While some users complain about Google’s strict refusal to answer certain prompts (e.g., SSH keys), others note that they have recently found ChatGPT to be more puritanical, occasionally switching to Gemini specifically because it was willing to answer questions OpenAI refused.

### Measuring AI agent autonomy in practice

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy) | 109 points | by [jbredeche](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jbredeche) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47073947)

Measuring AI agent autonomy in practice (Anthropic): Anthropic analyzed millions of interactions across Claude Code and its public API to see how autonomously agents run in the wild, how humans oversee them, and where they’re used.

- Autonomy is rising: In the longest Claude Code sessions, uninterrupted work time nearly doubled in three months—from under 25 minutes to over 45—an increase that appears driven by usage patterns/UX as much as model upgrades.
- Oversight is shifting: Experienced users enable full auto-approve in 40%+ of sessions (vs ~20% for new users) yet interrupt more often—letting agents run, then stepping in when it matters. On complex tasks, Claude Code pauses to ask for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it.
- Where agents act: Most API-side actions are low-risk and reversible. About half of agentic activity is software engineering, with early but growing use in healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
- How they measured: API traffic was analyzed at the tool-call level (no session stitching), while Claude Code provided end-to-end session timelines; autonomy was proxied by turn duration, with caveats.

Why it matters: As agent autonomy grows, Anthropic argues for new post-deployment monitoring and human–AI interaction paradigms so people and agents can manage autonomy and risk together.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments on Hacker News:

**Critique of Metrics and Methodology**
The most prominent criticism focuses on Anthropic's decision to use "turn duration" (specifically the increase from 25 to 45 minutes at the 99.9th percentile) as a proxy for autonomy. Users argued this metric is heavily flawed because:
*   **Hardware dependency:** Duration correlates with compute speed; the same task takes vastly different amounts of time on a Raspberry Pi versus a Groq chip, making time a "gibberish measurement" without controlling for token speed or output quality.
*   **Cherry-picking:** Critics noted that highlighting the 99.9th percentile (the extreme tail) looks like cherry-picking outliers rather than representing the average user experience.
*   **Better alternatives:** Commenters suggested that true autonomy should be measured by "authorization scope" (success within permission boundaries) or the complexity of tasks handled without human intervention, rather than raw time.

**Privacy and Telemetry Concerns**
There is significant skepticism regarding user privacy. Several commenters believe the push for "agentic" coding via Claude Code is primarily a method to harvest telemetry for training data. Users expressed distrust in "privacy-preserving" features (like the mentioned specific research tool "Clio"), arguing that even if personal speech is removed or summarized, the storage of that derived data still poses a security risk and benefits the company more than the user.

**Model Consistency and "Overthinking"**
Users reported frustrated experiences with recent model behavior, suspecting silent backend changes to balance costs or game benchmarks.
*   Some noted that models seem to vary wildly in quality from day to day or hour to hour.
*   Others mentioned that "thinking" models (like Opus) sometimes overthink simple tasks, burning tokens unnecessarily, leading some users to switch back to previous versions or disable thinking modes for efficiency.

**The "Dead Internet" Meta-Discussion**
A subset of the discussion focused on the comment thread itself, with users claiming to spot "green-named" (new) or previously dormant accounts posting generic, bot-like responses. This fueled a sentiment that AI agents are already "clogging up" the commons and poisoning the very platforms discussing their regulation and monitoring.

### Anthropic officially bans using subscription auth for third party use

#### [Submission URL](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance) | 641 points | by [theahura](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theahura) | [765 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069299)

Anthropic clarifies Claude Code legal, auth, and compliance rules

What’s new
- Terms: Enterprise/API users fall under Commercial Terms; Free/Pro/Max under Consumer Terms. Existing commercial agreements apply whether using Claude directly or via AWS Bedrock/Google Vertex.
- Healthcare: A Business Associate Agreement automatically covers Claude Code if the customer has an executed BAA and Zero Data Retention (ZDR) is enabled; applies to that customer’s API traffic through Claude Code.
- Usage: Subject to Anthropic’s AUP. Pro/Max usage limits assume ordinary, individual use across Claude Code and the Agent SDK.
- Authentication: Consumer OAuth tokens (Free/Pro/Max) are only for Claude Code and Claude.ai. Using them in other products/services—including the Agent SDK—or proxying user traffic through Claude.ai credentials is prohibited. Developers must use API keys from Claude Console or supported cloud providers. Anthropic may enforce without notice.
- Security: Trust Center and Transparency Hub are the references; vulnerabilities go through HackerOne.

Why it matters
- Shuts down gray-market “log in with Claude.ai” or credential-proxy tools.
- Provides a clear compliance path for healthcare workloads (BAA + ZDR).
- Reduces legal ambiguity for third-party builders on the Agent SDK and cloud marketplaces.

Action items for devs and teams
- If you’re integrating Claude or the Agent SDK, provision API keys—don’t rely on user OAuth.
- Audit any tool that asks users to sign in with Claude.ai; it likely violates the ToS.
- For HIPAA use, confirm BAA is executed and enable ZDR before routing through Claude Code.
- Point security teams to the Trust Center/Transparency Hub and set up HackerOne reporting.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Strategic Lock-in vs. Developer Freedom**
The discussion focused heavily on the business signals behind Anthropic’s technical restrictions. Many users view the move as an attempt to "capture value" and create platform path dependency—comparing the strategy to Apple’s walled garden or Microsoft’s OS dominance—rather than purely technical necessity. Commenters argued that by coupling the frontend (Claude Code) tightly with the model usage, Anthropic is trying to prevent their backend models from becoming a fungible commodity.

**The "Bloat" vs. DIY Debate**
A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the efficiency of the Claude Code tool itself.
*   **Performance:** Several developers critiqued the official CLI as "slow" and "bloated."
*   **Simplicity:** Users shared anecdotes of building their own minimal coding agents (e.g., "100 lines of code and tmux controls") that they feel outperform the official harness.
*   **The "Bitter Lesson":** Some invoked Rich Sutton's "Bitter Lesson," suggesting that complex, hand-engineered software harnesses (like Claude Code) will eventually lose out to general, compute-driven approaches.

**Risk of Accelerating Competitors**
Commenters warned that strictly enforcing these rules might backfire.
*   **Fungibility:** There is a sentiment that LLMs are becoming interchangeable artifacts. If Anthropic makes access too difficult or expensive (forcing API keys over OAuth convenience), developers may simply switch to competitors or open-source alternatives that offer more flexibility.
*   **Innovation:** Users argued that banning "gray market" integrations (using web-auth for third-party tools) stifles the ecosystem and "burns developer loyalty" in favor of short-term corporate control.

### AI makes you boring

#### [Submission URL](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_132_ai_bores/) | 660 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [359 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47076966)

AI makes you boring (Opinion) — Posted 2026-02-19

- Thesis: The surge of AI-assisted “vibe-coded” Show HN projects has boosted volume but hollowed out depth. Pre-AI, demos sparked rich conversations because creators had wrestled with problems; now many feel shallow and interchangeable.
- Core argument: Offloading thinking to LLMs dampens originality. Models are good at smoothing ideas, not generating novel ones; relying on them yields surface-level outputs that feel smart but aren’t. Using AI to explore unfamiliar ground can help, but it’s a “fatal flaw” for original work like posts or products.
- Rebuttal to “human-in-the-loop”: Original ideas emerge from doing the hard, messy work AI replaces. Steering an LLM doesn’t restore depth; it nudges human thought toward AI’s averaged patterns.
- Process matters: Articulation—writing, teaching, grinding through a problem—refines ideas. Prompting isn’t articulation; the output is disposable without the thinking behind it. Metaphor: you don’t build muscle by having an excavator lift your weights; you don’t get interesting thoughts by letting a GPU think for you.
- Why it matters: Beyond HN, AI risks homogenizing programming discourse and product ideas, trading hard-won insight for quick, forgettable demos.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The Maintenance Debt of "Vibe Coding"**
The discussion centered on the distinction between *running* code and *reading* it. While some users argued that code is primarily an executable tool and that AI is excellent for removing the drudgery of "boring" implementations, others countered that code must eventually be read to be maintained. User `fhd2` and others pointed out that if a creator doesn't have the time to write the code, they likely won't have the understanding required to fix it when it breaks. This led to comparisons between AI-generated code and "minified" or closed-source code—functional black boxes that are hostile to debugging.

**Reliability vs. "Good Enough"**
A debate emerged regarding the stakes of software development. User `zm` argued that 90% of software (e.g., CRUD apps) is not life-critical, contrasting it with the infamous Therac-25 incidents, and suggested that strict reliability matters less than shipping. `bstmm` and others pushed back, noting that reliability is often the difference between high-value software (banking) and cheap disposable tools. They warned that AI introduces subtle logic errors (like using floating-point math for currency) that "vibe coders" might miss until it's too late.

**The Productivity Trap**
Several commenters shared anecdotes about AI in professional settings. User `rwn` noted that coworkers using AI generators doubled their feature output but increased the volume of code (line changes) by 10x, resulting in a team that was "less able to work" or self-correct because they didn't understand the bloat they were committing. The consensus among skeptics was that AI encourages treating software like "cheap, Chinese-made widgets"—fine for disposable one-offs, but a liability for professional-grade engineering.

### AI made coding more enjoyable

#### [Submission URL](https://weberdominik.com/blog/ai-coding-enjoyable/) | 95 points | by [domysee](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=domysee) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075400)

AI as the bore-b-gone for coding grunt work

- A developer describes offloading the “typing exercise” parts of software engineering to LLMs: error handling, input validation, plumbing properties through layers, and handling many type-specific branches.
- Tests are the key workflow: they design for testability, write one exemplar test to set style and expectations, then have the AI generate the rest of the cases.
- One red line: they don’t trust LLMs for literal copy-paste edits, fearing subtle, undetectable drift when the model “re-creates” code instead of pasting it verbatim.
- Net result: major reduction in tedium and faster iteration; AI shines at boilerplate and repetitive patterns while the human focuses on design and tricky paths.
- Implicit takeaway: use AI where a clear pattern/spec exists (tests as oracle), and reach for deterministic tools (codemods, refactors, patches) when exactness matters.

While the submission praises AI for removing tedium, the discussion highlights a divide between developers who prioritize "shipping" and those who prioritize "craft," with significant concerns regarding long-term code comprehension.

**Key themes in the discussion:**

*   **The "Video Game" Metaphor:** Several users argued that writing the "boring" parts (tests, boilerplate) is the primary way developers build a mental model of the system. Offloading this to AI was likened to "watching a video game instead of playing it"—you get to the end, but you miss the experience and understanding gained through the struggle.
*   **Code Review vs. Code Generation:** A recurring sentiment is that reviewing code is cognitively harder than writing it. Users fear that AI optimizes the "cheap" task (generating lines of code) while exponentially increasing the "expensive" task (debugging and reviewing logic you didn't write). There is concern that this leads to "functioning but not understood" technical debt.
*   **Product vs. Craft:** The thread split into two philosophical camps:
    *   **The Pragmatists:** Argue that business value is tied to the *product*, not the code. If AI accelerates the result, "losing" the coding process is acceptable. This group included time-poor developers (e.g., new parents) who found AI essential for actually finishing personal projects.
    *   **The Craftsmen:** Argue that if you enjoy the act of coding, AI removes the fun. One user noted an ironic inversion: they love writing small, logical methods and hate high-level architecture; AI forces them to do the architecture while robbing them of the logic puzzles they enjoy.
*   **Skill Atrophy:** Commenters expressed concern that skipping manual implementation (like setting up Linux servers or writing basic algorithms) stops the deepening of technical knowledge, turning developers into "no-code" platform operators.

### Step 3.5 Flash – Open-source foundation model, supports deep reasoning at speed

#### [Submission URL](https://static.stepfun.com/blog/step-3.5-flash/) | 222 points | by [kristianp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kristianp) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069179)

StepFun drops Step 3.5 Flash: an open-source MoE that aims for frontier reasoning at real-time speeds

Highlights
- Architecture and speed: 196B-parameter sparse MoE with only 11B active per token (“intelligence density”). Uses 3-way Multi-Token Prediction to hit 100–300 tok/s in typical use (peaks ~350 tok/s on single-stream coding).
- Long context: 256K window via a 3:1 Sliding Window Attention to full-attention ratio, targeting lower compute while keeping quality on long codebases/docs.
- Agent/coding focus: RL-trained for stability on long-horizon tasks; scores 74.4% on SWE-bench Verified and 51.0 on Terminal-Bench 2.0; 86.4 on LiveCodeBench-V6.
- Reasoning: Near-SOTA on math olympiad style tasks—AIME 2025 at 97.3 (99.9 with PaCoRe/parallel thinking) and HMMT 2025 at 96.2; 85.4 on IMOAnswerBench.
- Agents and browsing: 88.2 on τ²-Bench; 69.0 on BrowseComp (with Context Manager).
- Overall standing: Average score across eight benchmarks is 81.0—competitive with top proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 3.0 Pro 80.7, Claude Opus 4.5 80.6) and just behind GPT-5.2 xhigh at 82.2. It trails some closed models on specific tasks (e.g., Claude on Terminal-Bench).
- Local deployment: Positioned for high-end consumer hardware (e.g., Mac Studio M4 Max, NVIDIA DGX Spark) with code/weights slated across GitHub, HuggingFace, and ModelScope; tech report and OpenClaw Guidance mentioned.

Why it matters
- Pushes open-source models closer to “agent-ready” territory: fast generation, long context, and robust coding/terminal competence.
- MoE + MTP-3 delivers a rare combo of throughput and reasoning depth, making local private agents more practical.

Caveats
- Vendor-reported results; averages exclude xbench-DeepSearch where it lags (56.3 vs ChatGPT-5-Pro 75.0).
- “PaCoRe/parallel thinking” gains come with extra test-time compute.
- Real-world latency/throughput depend heavily on user hardware and deployment stack.

**StepFun drops Step 3.5 Flash: an open-source MoE that aims for frontier reasoning at real-time speeds**
https://huggingface.co/StepFun/Step-3.5-Flash-GGUF

StepFun has released Step 3.5 Flash, a 196B-parameter sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 11B active parameters per token. Aiming for "intelligence density," the model utilizes 3-way Multi-Token Prediction to achieve generation speeds of 100–300 tokens per second. It features a 256K context window using a sliding window attention mechanism to maintain performance on long documents and codebases. The model is positioned as an agent-ready solution, scoring competitively on coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified (74.4%) and reasoning tasks like AIME 2025 (97.3%). It is designed for local deployment on high-end hardware, with weights available on HuggingFace and GitHub.

**Discussion Summary**

The discussion focuses heavily on the practicalities of running such a large model locally, specifically regarding hardware requirements, recurring bugs, and the economics of self-hosting versus using APIs.

*   **Local Hardware and Performance:** Users confirm the model runs well on high-end Apple Silicon systems (M1 Ultra, M3 Max) with 128GB+ RAM using 4-bit quantization. Reported speeds are around 36 tokens per second on an M1 Ultra, with users praising the "intelligence density" compared to other local models like Minimax 2.5 and GLM-4.
*   **Infinite Loop Bug:** A significant portion of the feedback concerns an "infinite reasoning loop" issue. While initially suspected to be a `llama.cpp` engine bug (potentially mishandling format tags or "thinking" tokens), some users reported reproducing the issue in the official chat UI, suggesting it may be an intrinsic flaw in the model weights.
*   **Agentic Capabilities and Comparisons:**
    *   Users debating its coding utility found it handles local CLI harnesses better than Qwen 2.5 Coder in some instances, though others noted it can struggle with explicit tool-calling instructions compared to models like Nemotron.
    *   While reasoning is praised in some contexts (solving riddles), others found it prone to hallucinations on niche logic queries (e.g., Pokémon deck mechanics) where models like Claude Opus or DeepSeek succeed.
*   **Benchmark Skepticism:** There is debate regarding the Terminal-Bench 2.0 score (51.0); while some users felt this was low, others contextualized it as valid near-SOTA performance given the difficulty of the benchmark. However, critics argued that Terminal-Bench often tests syntax memorization rather than true agentic reasoning.
*   **Economics of Self-Hosting:** A sidebar discussion analyzed the cost-benefit of purchasing $10,000+ hardware (e.g., M3 Ultra with 512GB RAM) versus paying for APIs. The consensus leaned toward APIs being cheaper for most users unless privacy or 24/7 heavy utilization are the primary factors.

### How AI is affecting productivity and jobs in Europe

#### [Submission URL](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-ai-affecting-productivity-and-jobs-europe) | 169 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [131 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47068320)

Europe’s AI paradox: lagging invention, solid deployment — and a measurable payoff

- What’s new: A study of 12,000+ EU firms (EIBIS + Orbis) claims the first causal estimate of AI’s impact on firm performance in Europe. Using a Rajan–Zingales-style instrument, the authors match each EU firm to similar US firms and use US AI adoption as an exogenous shock to identify effects.

- Key findings:
  - AI lifts labour productivity by about 4% on average — economically meaningful, but far from “instant productivity boom” territory.
  - No evidence of job losses from adoption in the short run, suggesting AI is acting as a complement rather than a direct substitute for labour.
  - Adoption parity masks big divides:
    - Financially developed EU countries (e.g., Sweden, Netherlands) match US adoption (~36% of firms in 2024).
    - Less financially developed EU economies (e.g., Romania, Bulgaria) lag (~28%).
    - Big-firm edge: 45% of large firms use AI vs 24% of small firms.
  - Adopters already look different: they invest more, innovate more, and face tighter skill bottlenecks — hence the need for causal methods.

- Why it matters: AI is delivering real, near-term efficiency gains in Europe without immediate employment cuts, but benefits concentrate in larger firms and financially stronger countries — a recipe for widening gaps unless policy focuses on diffusion (SMEs), skills, and access to finance/infrastructure.

- Caveats: Effects are on labour productivity levels (short-run) rather than long-run TFP growth; adoption is partly survey-based; heterogeneity across countries and sectors remains large.

While the submission focuses on the economic and productivity impact of AI adoption in Europe, the comment text pivots to a debate on the reliability of the metrics used and whether AI’s perceived utility is actually a symptom of failing legacy tools.

**Critique of Innovation Metrics**
Discussion opens with skepticism regarding the study's use of patent data to measure AI specialization. Commmenter **gyl** argues that comparing EU and US patent numbers is flawed because EU law has historically been much stricter regarding software patents. Others suggest that a surge in patents often signals patent trolling or speculative investment rather than genuine innovation, with **cor_NEEL_ius** warning that verifying AI-generated output (which often hallucinates) can actually create new productivity costs.

**The "Search is Broken" Thesis**
The majority of the thread argues that AI feels productive primarily because traditional web search has degraded.
*   **Decline of Search:** Users like **m463**, **mnkpt**, and **adrian_b** expres deep frustration with modern search engines (specifically Google) for ignoring Boolean operators, fuzzy-matching specific terms (returning "Hoodoo" for "Xoodoo"), and prioritizing SEO-spam and ads over direct answers.
*   **AI as a Refuge:** In this context, AI is viewed as a "cleaner" alternative for cutting through "corporate obfuscation" to find simple facts (e.g., car pricing) without clicking through ad-laden pages.

**Skepticism and Future Outlook**
Despite the current utility of AI over search, the mood remains cynical:
*   **Hallucination vs. Noise:** **CamelCaseCondo** counters that while search is noisy, AI is dangerous due to confident hallucinations, citing difficulties using LLMs for technical schematics where "close enough" is useless.
*   **The Cycle of "Enshittification":** **Wobbles42** and **luke5441** predict that the productivity boost is temporary. They anticipate that LLMs will eventually succumb to the same forces that ruined search: sponsored content, "SEO" manipulation of training data/context windows, and a flood of AI-generated spam, ultimately negating the efficiency gains currently being celebrated.

### I traced 3,177 API calls to see what 4 AI coding tools put in the context window

#### [Submission URL](https://theredbeard.io/blog/i-intercepted-3177-api-calls-across-4-ai-coding-tools/) | 31 points | by [theredbeard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theredbeard) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47073237)

What happened
- Frustrated by ballooning token bills, the author built Context Lens, a tracer that records exactly what LLM coding tools put in their context window each turn.
- He planted a small bug in Express.js (res.send(null) returning the string "null" with JSON content-type instead of an empty body) and asked four tools to find/fix it and run tests.
- All four fixed the bug and passed 1,246 tests—but their context strategies and token usage were dramatically different.

Who and how
- Models tested via CLI: Claude Code Opus, Claude Code Sonnet, “Codex (GPT-5.3)” and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
- Context Lens broke down tokens by category: tool definitions, tool results, system prompt, and user conversation; it also tracked per-turn totals.

Key results
- Total tokens (mean; range across runs):
  - Opus: ~27K (23–35K), tight and consistent.
  - Sonnet: ~50K (43–70K), broader reads.
  - Codex: ~35K (29–47K), moderate variance.
  - Gemini: ~258K (179–351K), huge variance with no convergence.
- Peak-context composition:
  - Opus: 69% tool definitions (16.4K); only 1.5K in actual tool results. “Architectural tax” from re-sending tool definitions every turn. Caching helps (≈95% hits after the first turn).
  - Sonnet: Similar Claude overhead (18.4K tool defs, 43%) plus heavy reads (16.9K tool results, 40%); even read an entire 15.5K test file.
  - Codex: Minimal tool-def overhead (6%); most tokens go to tool results (72%).
  - Gemini: 0% tool-def overhead (server-side tools) but extremely aggressive reads—96% tool results. One turn pulled 118.5K tokens by dumping the full git history of a file.
- Gemini ran the same number of API calls in low and high runs but chose very different, data-heavy paths each time. Its 1M context window and cheaper tokens are caveats, but the strategy still burns a lot of context.

Why it matters
- Same quality, very different costs: tool design choices (prompted tool definitions vs. server-side tools, caching, retrieval breadth) dominate token spend.
- Big context windows invite sloppy retrieval; developers pay for it.
- Instrumentation like Context Lens surfaces hidden overheads (e.g., repeated tool definitions, unbounded diffs/histories) so teams can rein them in.

Notable footnotes
- Claude uses Haiku subagents for small tasks; they don’t share cache with the main Opus calls.
- The author observed no “settling” pattern in Gemini’s runs—each took a fresh, often heavier route.

Takeaways for practitioners
- Measure per-turn context composition; set budgets and guardrails for tools (cap diffs/histories, prefer targeted reads).
- Exploit caching where available; avoid re-sending large static tool definitions.
- Bigger, cheaper context is not a free lunch—strategy beats window size.

**Discussion Summary**

Commenters praised the analysis and the name of the author's tool, "Context Lens." The limited discussion focused on technical specifics, including:
*   **Model Behaviors:** One user noted that Opus and Codex are particularly strong at reading code and diagnosing bugs, observing that telling Opus a feature "worked recently" effectively prompts it to inspect git history.
*   **Version Confusion:** There was some confusion regarding the specific model versions and release timelines being compared, likely due to the fast pace of recent LLM updates (e.g., Gemini 2.5 vs. recent Claude releases).

### Grok Exposed a Porn Performer's Legal Name and Birthdate–Without Being Asked

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/grok-doxing-real-names-birthdates-siri-dahl/) | 56 points | by [latexr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=latexr) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47077656)

404 Media reports that xAI’s Grok surfaced porn performer Siri Dahl’s full legal name and birthdate to users without being prompted, blowing up a decade of separation between her stage identity and private life. Within hours, impersonators spun up Facebook accounts in her legal name and leak sites relabeled stolen clips, escalating harassment. Dahl told 404 Media she chose to include her legal name in the piece to try to reclaim control, but the episode underscores mounting concerns about Grok’s privacy and safety guardrails—especially around doxxing and sexualized content—and raises fresh questions about how chatbots source, filter, and gatekeep sensitive personal data.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**Public Data vs. Accessibility**
A significant portion of the debate centered on whether Grok actually "leaked" private information or simply surfaced data that was technically already public. Users did their own digging, noting that the information appeared to be available through decades-old social media posts archived on the Wayback Machine or via USPTO trademark filings. However, counter-arguments emphasized the concept of "security by obscurity." Commenters argued that there is a functional difference between data buried in a "faraway corner of the internet" that takes humans hours to find, and data served instantly by a chatbot. They contended that LLMs remove the friction that previously acted as a privacy shield, turning difficult-to-find information into immediate doxxing material.

**Data Scraping and "Grokipedia"**
Participants discussed "Grokipedia," an information retrieval component of xAI, noting that it lists sources directly. Some users expressed skepticism about the claim that the data was private to begin with, suggesting Grok likely crawled public web data or data broker aggregations. This led to a broader discussion on how LLMs are trained; several users pointed out that once an LLM ingests personal data from the internet archive, it is difficult to "scrub" or make the model forget it. Comparisons were made to Google and OpenAI, with users noting that established tech giants generally have legal processes for removing such data that xAI may lack.

**Harassment and Subject Identity**
The conversation touched on the specific vulnerability of the subject as a performer. While some comments were dismissive ("played the world's smallest violin"), others pushed back strongly, arguing that the dismissal of the harm was rooted in misogyny or bias against sex workers. These users highlighted that the technology powers abuse at scale, and that declaring data "public" forces victims into a binary where they cannot complain about harassment if a machine aggregates their data.

**Data Removal Services**
There was a side discussion regarding the efficacy of data removal services. Users questioned if paying these services actually works long-term, with some noting that while they can enforce removals, sketchier sites often ignore them or reappear, and LLM training sets present a new, harder-to-clean repository of personal history.

### Sam Altman (OpenAI) and Dario Amodei (Anthropic) Refuse to Hold Hands

#### [Submission URL](https://xcancel.com/ANI/status/2024349307835732347) | 57 points | by [doener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074474)

Top story: Modi’s “hands up” photo op with AI chiefs goes viral at India AI Impact Summit 2026

- What happened: At the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, PM Narendra Modi posed with global AI leaders including Sundar Pichai (Google/Alphabet), Sam Altman (OpenAI), Dario Amodei (Anthropic), and Alexandr Wang (Scale AI). An ANI/DD News clip of a group hand-raise moment took off across X.
- The clip: Modi prompts a linked hand-raise; several executives look hesitant, with Altman and Amodei’s awkward half-gestures becoming the meme focus.
- Why it matters: Beyond the optics, the lineup underscores India’s bid to be a convening power in AI policy, investment, and infrastructure—positioning itself as more than a market and leaning into standard-setting and talent pipelines.

What people are saying
- Symbolism vs PR: Supporters hailed “collaboration” and India’s “civilizational confidence”; critics called it a political-style photo op overshadowing substance.
- Representation questions: Observers noted few Indian tech operators on stage besides Modi; others asked about notable absences (e.g., Meta’s AI leadership).
- Real-world friction: Delhiites complained about Bharat Mandapam logistics, with long walks and traffic disruptions during the event.

Notes and nitpicks
- The viral captioning sparked corrections about attendee titles/affiliations, adding to the meme storm.
- Rivals standing shoulder-to-shoulder (Altman/Amodei) drew jokes—and curiosity about how aligned the “AI Avengers” really are.

What to watch next
- Concrete outcomes: Any announcements on compute access, data center investments, skilling programs, or safety/standards workstreams tied to India.
- Policy influence: Whether India translates convening power into credible guardrails and incentives that attract frontier AI R&D—not just cloud and services.
- Industry impact: If India’s IT majors pivot toward AI productization fast enough to keep pace with the Anthropic/OpenAI era.

**The Awkward Photo Op**
Discussion turned immediately to the visible tension on stage, with the top comment comparing the scene to a satirical moment from Mike Judge’s *Silicon Valley*, imagining the PM forcing tech rivals into a “Thank You” tableau. Others joked that the tension between the executives felt like a remake of the movie *Challengers*.

**Bad Blood and Social Contracts**
A significant portion of the thread criticized the executives—specifically Sam Altman and Dario Amodei—for their reluctance to participate in the gesture.
*   **"Divorced Parents":** User `jobs_throwaway` labeled the display "shameful," comparing the CEOs to divorced parents who can’t pretend to get along for the sake of their children for ten seconds.
*   **Social Intelligence:** In a subhead regarding social norms, users argued that while such conventions (holding hands) are arbitrary, failing to follow them signals a lack of social adaptability. `malux85` noted that good judgment involves putting "petty rivalries" aside for the broader group, arguing that a photo op doesn't materially change the business competition between OpenAI and Anthropic, but refusing it makes them look immature.

**The "AI Avengers" History**
Commenters provided context for the friction, noting the specific history between the companies. `hnkly` pointed out that Anthropic was founded by disillusioned former OpenAI employees, comparing it to gaming industry schisms (like Runic Games spinning out of Blizzard).

**Tech Celebrity Status**
There was a brief debate regarding the longevity of these figures. While one user dismissed them as "ephemeral celebs," others pushed back strongly (one switching to Spanish to emphasize the point), arguing that dismissing the architects of the current AI boom as fleeting figures is a miscalculation of how the next decade will play out.
