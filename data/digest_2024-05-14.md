### A review on protein language models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.apoorva-srinivasan.com/plms/) | 135 points | by [apoorva26](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=apoorva26) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40350954)

The world of proteins and human language have more in common than you might think. Just as words form sentences, protein sequences of amino acids determine the structure and function of proteins. Researchers have been leveraging language models, like transformer models, trained on protein data, with exciting results.

Similar to how human languages have modular elements, proteins have motifs and domains that act as building blocks in constructing complex structures. The concept of information completeness is also parallel between the two, where a protein's behavior is influenced by its sequence, despite external factors.

ProtGPT2, an early example of a decoder model in the protein world, successfully generated sequences resembling natural proteins. However, newer approaches like ProGen have integrated deeper biological contexts during training, leading to the creation of protein sequences that function effectively, demonstrating significant advancements in protein design.

ProGen, conditioned on protein sequences with UniProtKB Keywords, has shown impressive results by creating proteins that perform as well as or better than naturally occurring ones. This breakthrough paves the way for designing proteins with specific functions, opening new possibilities in the field of protein engineering.

### Current AI models are more creative than humans on divergent thinking tasks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10858891/) | 14 points | by [amichail](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amichail) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40359920)

The top story on Hacker News today discusses a recent study that compared the creative potential of humans to that of artificial intelligence (AI) generative language models. The study found that AI, specifically GPT-4, was significantly more creative than human participants in divergent thinking tasks. This suggests that current AI models demonstrate a higher level of creative potential than humans when it comes to generating original and elaborate responses. The emergence of AI models like GPT has sparked conversations about the capabilities and limitations of AI in various domains, including creativity. Researchers are delving into the implications of AI on tasks that require creative thinking and problem-solving, challenging the traditional notion that creativity is a uniquely human trait.

The discussion on the Hacker News thread regarding the top story about a study comparing the creative potential of humans and AI brings up different perspectives. One user, "mistrial9", points out that a recent white paper solved a technical non-confidence debate by stating that General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) handles fifty percent of human tasks, such as color desk jobs, and fifty percent of the tasks are blindness, making a declaration of futility. Another user, "Nasrudith", highlights that human creativity is narrowly defined, and Mechanical Turk work is suggested to be surpassed by AI, pointing out that the AI substitutes lack of true intent much like outsourced cheap labor. However, the user notes that in a general sense, human creativity is still applicable. Additionally, "Terr_" comments that machines might appear creative to humans, but the intrinsically motivated nature of human creativity tasks remains.

On another note, "jrssn" mentions how current random number generators are used for creative tasks related to number-picking. Another user, "Log_out_", emphasizes that generations of mission failure in divergent thinkers are slowing down the genetic science culture, suggesting that AI is finally beginning to fill the gap. The user concludes by noting the necessity of removing the filtered human breakthroughs to drive real innovation.
