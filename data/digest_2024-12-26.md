### OpenAI is Visa – Buttering up the government to retain a monopoly

#### [Submission URL](https://sherwood.news/tech/openai-is-visa/) | 245 points | by [gpi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gpi) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517260)

In a recent analysis by Taylor Lorenz, OpenAI is likened to Visa in its approach to dominating the artificial intelligence landscape. As Visa faced competition from emerging digital payment providers, OpenAI is grappling with rivals like Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which are rolling out their own large language models. Lorenz suggests that OpenAI is attempting to solidify its market position not purely through technological innovation, but by creating barriers that limit competition—much like Visa did in the payment processing industry.

OpenAI's projected revenue of $100 billion by 2029 comes with the acknowledgment that the technology powering this growth—large language models—may soon be widely accessible, turning the innovative edge into a commodity. In response, OpenAI has been lobbying for regulatory measures that could stifle competition while also securing exclusive deals with investors and firms, as seen in its recent funding rounds. This strategy, aimed at making OpenAI the default choice for AI applications, raises questions about the sustainability of such a competitive moat in an evolving tech landscape.

However, as Musk becomes a notable challenger and political winds shift regarding AI regulation, OpenAI may face significant hurdles in maintaining its edge. The article underscores a key takeaway: in the battle for AI supremacy, competition may yet prove to be the ultimate loser.

In the discussion surrounding Taylor Lorenz's analysis comparing OpenAI to Visa, several users express skepticism about the parallels drawn between the two companies. One commenter, "insane_dreamer," questions whether Visa's regulatory influence truly helped maintain its monopoly and suggests that the article lacks strong supporting evidence. The conversation then dives deeper into the regulatory dynamics, discussing how OpenAI's push for AI regulations might aim to reduce competition akin to Visa's strategies.

Another user, "Spooky23," highlights the problematic nature of credit card systems where consumers and small businesses often bear the costs, emphasizing a lack of incentive for credit card companies to offer fairer terms, similar to the issues OpenAI might face in establishing a competitive edge. Comments also touch on the broader implications of financial regulation and competitive practices, with references to how large corporations navigate their advantages over smaller players.

While some participants debate the nuances of Visa's market impact, they acknowledge that the tech landscape's evolving nature might bring significant competition that challenges OpenAI’s current strategies. Overall, there is uncertainty surrounding whether OpenAI's approach can effectively secure long-term dominance in a rapidly changing AI ecosystem, with some indicating that such tactics could ultimately backfire as competition increases.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.christo.sh/building-agi-on-the-tokio-runtime/) | 100 points | by [openquery](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=openquery) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42516041)

**Title: One Developer’s Journey into Building AGI: A Candid Experiment**

As AI heavyweights like OpenAI, DeepMind, and xAI continue their quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), one intrepid developer decided to take the challenge into his own hands. On Christmas Day 2024, inspired by the frustration with not seeing AGI realized yet, he shared his candid account of attempting to create his own version, despite lacking expertise in machine learning and neuroscience.

Drawing an analogy to a struggling Formula 1 driver, he recognized that following established paths (such as deep learning) would lead to inevitable defeat. With this in mind, he opted for an unconventional route, diving into concepts from neuroscience to create an asynchronous neural network on the Tokio runtime in Rust.

Through his exploration, he illustrated the intricacies of a neuron's function using a simplified model that highlights neuron components—dendrites, cell body, and axon—while lamenting the limited understanding of how brains truly operate. He mused about various types of neurons and the potential of information encoding in neuron firing times versus rates.

Despite acknowledging the complexity he might face, he proposed that his biologically inspired design could leverage emergent properties of neuron configurations, hinting at possibilities for something akin to consciousness within the network.

With ambitious implementation plans utilizing Tokio for its fast asynchronous features, he detailed his neuron struct and its communication-oriented architecture. His approach—bold, albeit filled with uncertainty and inherent challenges—raises questions about the nature of intelligence itself and what truly defines consciousness.

In this insightful piece, the reader is encouraged to ponder the possibilities and limitations of AGI through the lens of one man's earnest experiment, showcasing both the excitement and vulnerability inherent in pioneering AI frontiers.

In the Hacker News discussion following the submission titled "One Developer’s Journey into Building AGI," users engaged in a multifaceted conversation about the merits and challenges of developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) through unconventional methods, drawing parallels to the author's approach.

One user invoked mathematician Terence Tao to highlight that notable progress often emerges from the exploration of unsuccessful attempts.

Other participants critiqued conventional neural networks, advocating for more innovative and biologically inspired approaches that consider the complexities of neuronal function. Some mentioned alternative frameworks, noting their appeal for enhanced computational efficiency and addressing current limitations found in traditional architectures.

Discussion around specific methodologies also surfaced, with references to existing models and techniques that differ from the mainstream gradient descent approach. Contributors shared their own experimental experiences, advocating for a focus on emergent properties within neural networks and the value of interdisciplinary research combining neuroscience with AI. 

Overall, the conversation reflected a community passionate about exploring the boundaries of AGI, encouraging experimentations, and prioritizing innovative thinking over established norms, while also acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and challenges present in such pioneering work.
