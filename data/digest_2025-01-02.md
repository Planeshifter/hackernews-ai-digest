A recent paper on arXiv titled "TinyStories: How Small Can Language Models Be and Still Speak Coherent English?" by Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li tackles an intriguing question in the field of natural language processing: How small can language models (LMs) be while still generating coherent English? The authors reveal that smaller models, like those with around 125 million parameters, often struggle to produce consistent text. To address this, they introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset crafted from simple stories that align with the vocabulary of young children. 

Through their work, they demonstrate that LMs with fewer than 10 million parameters can still produce fluent stories that exhibit solid grammar and reasoning capabilities. Notably, the paper advocates a new evaluation framework that utilizes GPT-4 to grade the generated content, offering a multidimensional assessment of language models. This innovation could significantly advance research and development in LMs, particularly for lower-resource domains. 

As LMs continue to evolve, this work highlights the possibility of achieving impressive results even with minimal resources, potentially broadening the accessibility of these technologies. The full paper can be accessed for further insights into these cutting-edge findings.

Apple is set to pay $95 million to resolve a lawsuit concerning its voice assistant, Siri, which allegedly recorded private conversations without user consent and shared those recordings with third parties for targeted advertising. The class-action settlement, reached after five years of legal battles, does not imply any wrongdoing by Apple, which maintains the activations were "unintentional." The controversy resurfaced after a whistleblower exposed instances of sensitive conversations, including those of patients and business professionals, being inadvertently recorded. 

If the settlement is approved in a hearing scheduled for February 14, affected customers who purchased Siri-enabled devices from September 2014 to December 2024 may claim up to $20 per device, with the potential for monetary relief and assurance that recordings will be deleted. Although this resolution might provide some comfort to users, it has raised questions about how effectively Apple resolved the matter, especially considering that litigation could have resulted in more significant penalties under existing privacy laws. Meanwhile, Google faces similar allegations related to its voice assistant, with ongoing litigation expected to conclude later this year.

The discussion surrounding Apple's $95 million settlement over Siri's alleged unauthorized recording of private conversations reveals a mix of skepticism and concern among users. Some comments highlight the difficulty in trusting Apple's claims of unintentional recordings, pointing to the potential for Siri to have captured sensitive conversations related to brands and personal matters without consent. 

Several participants questioned whether the settlement truly addresses privacy violations, suggesting that litigation could have led to more substantial penalties. There are also comparisons made to Google's similar issues, with some voices expressing disbelief that such practices of listening and data collection are excusable or just mistakes.

Concerns about privacy have led some users to consider alternatives, such as Android devices or custom operating systems that could limit surveillance capabilities. The overall sentiment suggests a lingering distrust of tech companies' commitments to user privacy, despite the proposed settlement and assurances from Apple regarding data deletion.
