#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) | 198 points | by [tzury](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tzury) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42576755)

A recent paper on arXiv titled "TinyStories: How Small Can Language Models Be and Still Speak Coherent English?" by Ronen Eldan and Yuanzhi Li tackles an intriguing question in the field of natural language processing: How small can language models (LMs) be while still generating coherent English? The authors reveal that smaller models, like those with around 125 million parameters, often struggle to produce consistent text. To address this, they introduce TinyStories, a synthetic dataset crafted from simple stories that align with the vocabulary of young children. 

Through their work, they demonstrate that LMs with fewer than 10 million parameters can still produce fluent stories that exhibit solid grammar and reasoning capabilities. Notably, the paper advocates a new evaluation framework that utilizes GPT-4 to grade the generated content, offering a multidimensional assessment of language models. This innovation could significantly advance research and development in LMs, particularly for lower-resource domains. 

As LMs continue to evolve, this work highlights the possibility of achieving impressive results even with minimal resources, potentially broadening the accessibility of these technologies. The full paper can be accessed for further insights into these cutting-edge findings.

In the discussion surrounding the paper "TinyStories," participants dive into the implications of developing small language models (LMs) that can still generate coherent text. One commenter notes that while 125 million parameter models like GPT-Neo struggle with consistency, advances in training techniques—such as "sacrificial training"—might enhance the capabilities of smaller models, potentially rejuvenating their relevance. 

Others express interest in the RWKV model and how smaller models might handle tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). There's ongoing debate about the effectiveness of tiny models, with some arguing they can perform surprisingly well in generating text that is grammatically sound, while others question their overall utility. 

A related topic brought forward in the discussions is the challenge of integrating human psychological principles, like ADHD, into model training, suggesting that some limitations in LMs might parallel various cognitive processes. Additionally, users highlighted that smaller models can support applications in low-resource environments, prompting discussions about their potential viability in practical settings.

Overall, the discourse emphasizes a blend of optimism and skepticism regarding the capabilities and future prospects of tiny language models, along with curiosity about innovative training methodologies.

### Safety Filters make LLMs defective tools

#### [Submission URL](https://woolion.art/2025/01/02/DEFECTIVE.html) | 15 points | by [woolion](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=woolion) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42577739)

In a thought-provoking examination of safety filters in language models (LLMs), a recent post on Hacker News critiques the deficiencies inherent in their current implementations. The author argues that while safety filters are essential for managing user-generated content, they are often poorly executed, rendering LLMs less effective and trustworthy in applications like their own game, JOBifAI.

In JOBifAI, players use AI to secure job interviews, but they quickly encounter frustrating challenges when the LLM struggles with complex queries, often leading to abrupt game terminations. The author highlights how these safety mechanisms can result in frequent technical errors while burdening the user with inefficient retries and unnecessary costs.

The article calls for a more transparent and reliable error code system for handling sensitive queries, suggesting that this change could help developers better manage LLM interactions and enhance user experiences. Essentially, the piece argues for a balanced approach to AI safety that doesn’t hinder innovation but instead empowers developers with the tools necessary to create effective and secure applications. As the field continues to evolve, it’s clear that refining these safety filters is critical in transforming LLMs from mere obstacles into valuable allies in tech development.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding safety filters in language models (LLMs) reflects a strong dissatisfaction with their current implementations. Users express concerns that these filters can overly censor content and hinder the effectiveness of LLMs, particularly in scenarios requiring nuanced understanding, like the game JOBifAI. 

One commenter criticizes how these filters lead to frustration, arguing that while they exist to protect users, they often result in ineffective and inconsistent responses. This sentiment is echoed by others who note that while some safeguards are necessary, they should not limit the capabilities of adult users or professionals who require more robust functionalities.

Commenters further lament the overly simplistic nature of these safety filters, which can irrationally block content under the guise of moderation, ultimately rendering LLMs "lobotomized" and less capable. Others highlight the absurdity of certain restrictions, like filtering terms related to historical events or academic content. The overall consensus urges for a more balanced, transparent system that adequately supports both user safety and the development of effective AI applications.

### Siri "unintentionally" recorded private convos; Apple agrees to pay $95M

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/01/apple-agrees-to-pay-95m-delete-private-conversations-siri-recorded/) | 60 points | by [_tk_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_tk_) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42578929)

Apple is set to pay $95 million to resolve a lawsuit concerning its voice assistant, Siri, which allegedly recorded private conversations without user consent and shared those recordings with third parties for targeted advertising. The class-action settlement, reached after five years of legal battles, does not imply any wrongdoing by Apple, which maintains the activations were "unintentional." The controversy resurfaced after a whistleblower exposed instances of sensitive conversations, including those of patients and business professionals, being inadvertently recorded. 

If the settlement is approved in a hearing scheduled for February 14, affected customers who purchased Siri-enabled devices from September 2014 to December 2024 may claim up to $20 per device, with the potential for monetary relief and assurance that recordings will be deleted. Although this resolution might provide some comfort to users, it has raised questions about how effectively Apple resolved the matter, especially considering that litigation could have resulted in more significant penalties under existing privacy laws. Meanwhile, Google faces similar allegations related to its voice assistant, with ongoing litigation expected to conclude later this year.

The discussion surrounding Apple's $95 million settlement over Siri's alleged unauthorized recording of private conversations reveals a mix of skepticism and concern among users. Some comments highlight the difficulty in trusting Apple's claims of unintentional recordings, pointing to the potential for Siri to have captured sensitive conversations related to brands and personal matters without consent. 

Several participants questioned whether the settlement truly addresses privacy violations, suggesting that litigation could have led to more substantial penalties. There are also comparisons made to Google's similar issues, with some voices expressing disbelief that such practices of listening and data collection are excusable or just mistakes.

Concerns about privacy have led some users to consider alternatives, such as Android devices or custom operating systems that could limit surveillance capabilities. The overall sentiment suggests a lingering distrust of tech companies' commitments to user privacy, despite the proposed settlement and assurances from Apple regarding data deletion.
