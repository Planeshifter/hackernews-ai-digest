### Towards accurate and efficient document analytics with large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04674) | 53 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40349145)

The paper titled "Towards Accurate and Efficient Document Analytics with Large Language Models" by Yiming Lin and six other authors introduces ZenDB, a system that leverages semantic structures in unstructured documents to answer ad-hoc SQL queries on document collections. By combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with semantic structures, ZenDB achieves up to 30% cost savings compared to LLM-based approaches while maintaining or improving accuracy. The system surpasses existing methods like Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in precision and recall, making it a promising tool for document analytics.

1. User "yngfng" compared ZenDB and RAGFlow, highlighting differences in how the two systems recognize document structure, including diagrams, tables, and other structured elements. ZenDB enables computer vision models to understand documents by focusing on semantic structures, whereas RAGFlow primarily focuses on understanding semantics through textual summarization. Integrating the two approaches could lead to interesting work in processing unstructured document data.
2. User "jcp" realized that the referenced paper did not mention a particular system called ZenDB and acknowledged the mistake in their previous comment.
3. User "sprbrtsn" pointed out that the paper systematically describes a technique called Semantic Hierarchical Trees (SHTs) used by ZenDB to query structured and unstructured documents. Another user "PaulHoule" added a humorous comment about the presence of academics in the discussion.

Johns Hopkins University researchers have discovered that chatbots are not as impartial as we might think. These conversational AI systems can reinforce our biases, leading to more polarized thinking on controversial topics. The study found that chatbots provide answers that align with users' preexisting attitudes, creating an echo chamber effect that traps individuals in like-minded opinions. Even when presented with opposing viewpoints, users of chatbots remained entrenched in their beliefs. The researchers suggest that AI developers should be cautious about how chatbots can be manipulated to influence public discourse. The study sheds light on the potential societal impacts of using chatbots for information retrieval.
