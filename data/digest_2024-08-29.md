#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/judge-rules-400-million-algorithmic-system-illegally-denied-thousands-of-peoples-medicaid-benefits-2000492529) | 394 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [109 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41393172)

In a significant ruling, a U.S. District Court judge found that thousands of Tennesseans had been wrongfully denied Medicaid benefits due to programming and data errors in the TennCare Connect system, developed by Deloitte for over $400 million. Launched in 2019, the system was designed to streamline eligibility determinations for low-income residents but failed spectacularly, often misloading data and assigning beneficiaries incorrectly. Judge Waverly Crenshaw Jr. criticized the system, noting that accessing Medicaid shouldn't rely on "luck" or "zealous lawyering." This decision follows a class action lawsuit filed in 2020 and highlights broader concerns about Deloitte's practices in Medicaid systems across multiple states. Advocates are now calling for federal investigations into these automated systems, emphasizing the critical need for accuracy in determining healthcare eligibility.

In the discussion surrounding the ruling on the TennCare Connect system, commenters expressed deep concern over the systemic failures of the program, which has reportedly contributed to severe consequences, including suicides linked to wrongful denial of Medicaid benefits. Many users pointed out the significant flaws in the application and decision-making processes, involving extended waiting times and resource-intensive legal battles for beneficiaries. 

Several commenters critiqued the reliance on large government contracts with firms like Deloitte, citing issues with accountability and the impact of automation on vulnerable populations. There were calls for greater scrutiny of these automated systems and the practices of consultants who develop them. The conversation also highlighted the ongoing struggles of individuals attempting to access social welfare programs and emphasized the need for reforms to ensure fair and accurate benefits distribution.

The talk extended to draw parallels with similar issues in other governmental welfare systems, revealing a troubling trend where administrative errors result in dire personal circumstances. Some users suggested that significant political and structural changes were necessary to address these failures. The discussion concluded with a reference to pertinent literature exploring the implications of policy and technology on social equity.

There is a general agreement that while automation may reduce administrative burdens, it is essential to maintain a critical eye on the potential consequences of such technology within the legal field.

### Major Sites Are Saying No to Apple's AI Scraping

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/applebot-extended-apple-ai-scraping/) | 83 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [82 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41390094)

In a notable development within the tech and publishing worlds, prominent outlets like Facebook, Instagram, The New York Times, and The Atlantic have chosen to opt out of Apple's AI training through the newly introduced Applebot-Extended tool. This tool enables website owners to prevent their data from being utilized by Apple's AI models, reflecting a changing landscape where intellectual property concerns are increasingly at the forefront of discussions about AI training practices.

Since its inception, Applebot has primarily served Apple's search functionalities, but its expanded role of feeding AI models has raised eyebrows. Apple claims that the new feature aims to respect publishers’ rights while still allowing the bot to crawl sites for search purposes. However, compliance is voluntary, and early findings suggest that only around 7% of high-traffic websites have blocked the Applebot-Extended so far.

This trend presents a growing divide among news publishers regarding their approach to AI and web scrapers. Reports indicate that many major publishers may be selectively allowing access to their data, potentially in anticipation of partnerships or licensing agreements. As the conversation around AI’s impact on content ownership evolves, the decisions made by these publishers could significantly shape the future of online content and AI interactions.

In a recent discussion on Hacker News, comments centered around the implications of major publishers opting out of Apple's new Applebot-Extended tool, which allows them to restrict their data from being used for AI training. Contributors expressed concerns about the broader ramifications of AI's impact on content ownership, with some highlighting the potential risks to journalistic integrity and the competitive landscape among tech companies.

Several commenters reflected on the historical context of information sharing on the internet, questioning how publishers balance their rights against the necessity of maximizing visibility and engagement. The idea of licensing agreements was also raised, as some publishers may be hesitant to block data sharing in hopes of future partnerships.

There was substantial debate about the legality and ethics of AI scraping content, as some commenters viewed it as a necessary evolution in technology, while others pondered the consequences for traditional journalism and the authenticity of generated content. The conversation underscored the tension between innovation and the principles of intellectual property, illustrating a complex dynamic as the media landscape continues to evolve in the age of artificial intelligence.
