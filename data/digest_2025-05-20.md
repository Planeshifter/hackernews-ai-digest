We all turn to AI daily, whether for homework help, creating art, or generating videos. But have you ever wondered about the energy it takes to power this AI revolution? MIT Technology Review's latest analysis unveils the staggering energy demands behind every AI query, raising questions about the industry's transparency and future impact on our power grids.

AI's energy footprint isn't just about simple queries; it's about a colossal infrastructure shift. Tech giants like Meta and Microsoft are investing heavily in energy projects, with initiatives as ambitious as new nuclear power plants and expansive data centers, each potentially consuming more power than the entire state of New Hampshire.

The AI energy story is part of a broader narrative. While data centers once maintained steady electricity usage through improved efficiencies, the rise of AI has doubled their consumption since 2017. Currently, they're responsible for 4.4% of the US's power usage, and it's projected that by 2028, over half of the electricity to data centers will fuel AI.

Alarmingly, as AI's reach grows—promising personalized services and complex problem-solving—the environmental toll is set to rise. Many AI operations run on more carbon-intensive energy as they quickly scale operations, leaving significant emissions behind. Predictions suggest that AI could eventually consume as much power annually as nearly a quarter of US households.

This energy surge comes amidst calls for transparency. Critics argue that the lack of detailed energy data from AI companies obscures effective planning for future demands and emissions. With AI models inching toward being the fifth-most visited online service globally, the stakes are high, not just for tech companies but for utility providers and governments worldwide.

Ultimately, navigating AI's unchecked energy demands will require a delicate balancing act—making AI’s consumption visible, equitable, and sustainable as we step into this new techno-future.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy consumption reveals several key themes and debates:

   Users express alarm over AI's growing energy demands, with comparisons to carbon-intensive activities like "rolling coal" (intentionally emitting diesel smoke). Some note that generating a single AI query (0.3–40 Wh) pales next to the environmental cost of such practices (10,000–100,000+ grams of CO2). However, critics argue AI's rapid scaling could still strain grids and worsen emissions.

2. **Tech Industry Transparency**:  
   Skepticism arises about tech giants (Meta, Google, etc.) not disclosing detailed energy data, complicating efforts to quantify AI's true footprint. Some users highlight initiatives like nuclear power investments but question their feasibility and timelines.

3. **Carbon Tax Debates**:  
   A contentious thread debates carbon taxes. Proponents argue they incentivize green tech, while opponents call them regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income groups. Revenue-neutral models (e.g., Canada’s rebate system) are discussed, though criticized as misunderstood or politically unpopular.

4. **AI Efficiency vs. Benefits**:  
   While some defend AI’s energy use as justified by societal benefits (e.g., education, problem-solving), others counter that unchecked growth risks outweighing gains. Technical users dissect energy metrics, comparing model sizes (e.g., DeepSeek’s 600B parameters) and query efficiency.

5. **Side Discussions**:  
   - Humor and typos: Lighthearted exchanges about comment typos and ChatGPT’s role in everyday tasks.  
   - Practical solutions: Offshore wind, nuclear, and distributed data centers are proposed, though latency concerns for AI applications are noted.  
   - Cultural critiques: Jabs at "rolling coal" as a symbol of anti-environmental sentiment contrast with calls for systemic policy changes.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores a tension between AI’s transformative potential and its environmental cost, with calls for transparency, equitable policy, and sustainable innovation to balance progress and planetary limits.

#### [Submission URL](https://zackproser.com/blog/openai-codex-review) | 150 points | by [fragmede](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fragmede) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44042070)

Imagine having an assistant that manages all your Git projects effortlessly, allowing you to focus on the bigger picture while it handles the boring details. This is precisely the vision of Codex, OpenAI's innovative platform that promises a seamless integration with GitHub to boost your productivity. However, like any tech in its early days, it’s not quite there yet.

Codex is a chat-focused tool that, once you're in, requires multi-factor authentication and some setup over at GitHub. It clones your repositories into its special sandboxes, letting you execute commands and create branches without ever leaving the interface. This setup means if you manage lots of repos, it feels like a powerhouse. But, if you're working on just one or two, it might feel like an overkill compared to a simple AI editor like Cursor.

One of the standout features of Codex is its multi-threaded approach. If you’re someone who dreams of launching your tasks in parallel and letting the code compile while you enjoy a peaceful walk in nature, Codex might be up your alley. You can toss various tasks at it, follow up via chats, check logs, and even let it handle opening pull requests for your features.

The platform isn't without its quirks, though. It struggles a bit with error handling and tends to open new pull requests for every little change, rather than allowing smooth updates to existing ones. Plus, shout out to all you devs: Codex doesn't brave the internet to solve dependency woes just yet, leaving you to handle them locally.

As for whether Codex supercharges productivity? Not exactly, not yet. But the potential is undeniably there. Once it improves multi-tasking, branch updates, and extends its integration capabilities—perhaps by weaving in more of OpenAI's platform goodies—it could well become the dream tool many devs have been waiting for. Until then, Codex serves as a promising glimpse into a more orchestrated future of software development, where a robust digital assistant truly changes the game.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion reflects mixed reactions to OpenAI's Codex, with users highlighting both potential and significant limitations:  

1. **Frustrations with Codex's UX and Reliability**:  
   - Users report a clunky setup process, unstable GitHub integration (disconnects/errors), and "blank screens" during use.  
   - Environment limitations (e.g., no container support, internet access) hinder resolving dependencies or running tests.  
   - Some compare it unfavorably to alternatives like **Cursor** (simpler for smaller projects) or **Claude/Gemini** (better context handling).  

2. **Workflow Successes and Challenges**:  
   - Parallel task execution and iterative prompting can yield results, especially for mid-sized projects, but require meticulous prompt tuning.  
   - Git integration is criticized: Codex auto-opens excessive PRs for minor changes and struggles with commit rollbacks.  

3. **Debates About LLMs Replacing Developers**:  
   - Non-technical users leveraging Codex to replace engineers is deemed exaggerated.  
   - Many argue that **problem-solving** and **system design skills** remain irreplaceable, even if LLMs automate code generation. Skeptics link to articles questioning AI’s readiness to replace skilled roles.  

4. **Practical Tradeoffs**:  
   - Codex can save time on boilerplate tasks but demands oversight to avoid “AI-generated spaghetti code.”  
   - Developers emphasize that **terminal/CLI proficiency**, debugging, and understanding frameworks remain critical barriers for non-technical users.  

**Verdict**: While Codex shows promise for parallel task management and code generation, its current limitations in UX, environment flexibility, and workflow maturity make it feel like a “half-baked” tool. Users agree it’s not yet a productivity game-changer but could evolve with better error handling, branch management, and deeper integration with OpenAI’s ecosystem. The broader discussion underscores skepticism about AI replacing developers but acknowledges its role in augmenting workflows—*if* the technical hurdles are addressed.

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/15424968) | 83 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44041515)

The European Lisp Symposium has unveiled an intriguing development in the realm of programming languages with "The Lisp in the Cellar." Researchers Pierre-Evariste Dagand and Frederic Peschanski have introduced the Deputy system, a Clojure-hosted programming language boasting dependent types. This cutting-edge system allows developers to partake in type-level computation intertwined with interactive programming, leveraging the dynamic Lisp-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Despite its dynamic approach to types, Deputy ensures all type-checking is completed during compile-time, combining the flexibility of Lisp with the rigors of dependently-typed logic.

The uniqueness of Deputy lies in its seamless integration into Clojure, thus allowing developers to remain within familiar territory when transitioning to type-level programming. Presented at the 18th European Lisp Symposium in Zurich, this research holds potential to reshape how the programming community approaches type systems, making it a significant contribution to the ongoing evolution of software development methodologies.

For those interested in diving deeper, the full paper is accessible on Zenodo under a Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives 4.0 International license. So far, it has garnered an impressive amount of attention with over 11,000 views and nearly 10,000 downloads, indicating its substantial impact and growing interest within the tech community.

🔎 **Why llm-d Matters:** 

The traditional scale-out model of Kubernetes, with its straightforward load balancing, doesn't cut it for LLM's unique demands. LLM requests are anything but uniform—they're hefty, expensive, and vary tremendously, leading to significant load imbalances and resource strains.

📈 **Why LLM Serving is Unique:**

1. **Resource Variances:** Each request has distinct shapes, causing overloaded instances and higher inter-token latency.
   
2. **Multi-Turn Magic:** Many LLM tasks are iterative. With llm-d’s caching and specialized routing, the system can bypass repetitive computations, enhancing performance and lowering latency.

3. **Split-Phase Power:** By disaggregating the prefill and decode phases across varied replicas, llm-d optimizes resource use, allowing for better throughput and efficiency.

4. **QoS Variety:** Different LLM applications have varied quality of service needs, from milliseconds for code completion to hours for batch processing. llm-d optimizes these to save resources and costs.

🔄 **The llm-d Advantage:**

As AI technology accelerates, the need for modular, high-performance solutions becomes critical. llm-d’s distributed architecture capitalizes on disaggregation and KV-caching, providing stellar performance at scale. However, most AI teams lack the resources to build such complex systems from scratch, which is where llm-d comes in, bridging the gap with ease of operation and deployment.

Whether you're aiming for lightning-speed code completions or broader, slower overlapped tasks like video call summarization, llm-d is your ticket to efficient and cost-effective AI operations. Embrace the future of AI infrastructure with **llm-d**—a revolutionary step in making high-quality LLM deployment accessible and efficient for all. 🚀

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around **llm-d** centers on comparisons with existing inference systems (e.g., NVIDIA Dynamo, vLLM, Ray, BentoML, kServe) and clarifies its unique architectural choices, Kubernetes integration, and target use cases. Key points include:

1. **Architecture & Differentiation**:
   - llm-d employs a **three-tier design**: dynamic request scheduling, model servers across heterogeneous hardware, and hierarchical prefix caching. This contrasts with NVIDIA Dynamo's SDK, which focuses on simplifying static deployments but lacks Kubernetes-native optimizations for dynamic traffic.
   - Unlike tools like kServe (geared for smaller-scale LLM serving), llm-d targets **large-scale production** (e.g., multi-host deployments with 5+ H100 GPUs), leveraging Kubernetes features like LeaderWorkerSets for distributed inference.

2. **Kubernetes Integration**:
   - llm-d acts as a Kubernetes-native "inference gateway," dynamically managing routing, request prioritization, and load balancing. This contrasts with Dynamo SDK's more static approach, which may conflict with the needs of large-scale deployments.
   - Supports multi-host inference via integration with vLLM and Kubernetes, addressing concerns about pipeline parallelism (raised in comparison to Ray).

3. **Use Cases & Model Focus**:
   - Optimized for **generative LLMs** (e.g., text/code generation) rather than models like CLIP, with a focus on overcoming unique LLM inference challenges (variable request sizes, multi-turn interactions).
   - Users debated naming conventions ("inference" vs. model-specific terms), but clarified that llm-d addresses the computational intensity of serving large generative models.

4. **Community Feedback**:
   - Clarifications were sought on how llm-d differs from vLLM's distributed serving docs; maintainers highlighted Kubernetes-native scheduling and integration as key.
   - kServe was noted as a viable alternative but seen as less optimized for very large deployments.

Overall, llm-d positions itself as a Kubernetes-first solution for dynamic, high-efficiency LLM serving at scale, bridging gaps in existing tools for demanding production environments.

Nick McGreivy, a recent Princeton PhD graduate and plasma physicist, has candidly shared his journey with AI in scientific research, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). McGreivy initially embraced the AI-for-science hype, motivated by its potential to revolutionize physics and its appealing career opportunities. However, he soon discovered that many AI methods, despite being lauded in numerous studies, often underperform compared to traditional numerical techniques when properly evaluated.

McGreivy’s key focus was on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a novel AI approach to solving PDEs that promised superior speed and efficiency. Yet, his experiments led to disappointing results, revealing that AI solutions were not the unparalleled breakthroughs they were claimed to be. He found that the advantages of AI methods often disappeared under rigorous, fair comparisons with state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

This experience, and others like it, have fueled skepticism about AI’s transformative impact on scientific progress. High-profile AI claims, such as DeepMind's controversial work on crystal structures, have been criticized for overstating their contributions. Furthermore, pervasive issues like data leakage in AI research raise concerns about validity and reproducibility, casting doubt on the real impact of AI breakthroughs.

Despite these challenges, AI adoption in research is rapidly increasing across various fields. Yet, McGreivy warns that this surge might reflect more on scientists' incentives and publication biases rather than genuine scientific advancement. AI's potential in science, while promising, may not be as revolutionary as anticipated, contributing more to gradual, incremental progress than ground-breaking discoveries.

Ultimately, McGreivy emphasizes that while AI remains a powerful tool for scientific inquiry, its adoption should be cautious and evidence-based, avoiding the pitfalls of sensationalism and unwarranted optimism. The path to scientific progress is complex, and AI's role in it is likely to be a supporting, rather than a leading, element.

### Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/akarshkumar0101/fer) | 43 points | by [mattdesl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mattdesl) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44038549)

In the world of AI and neural networks, a new position paper titled "The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis" is turning heads by challenging the conventional wisdom about neural network internal representations. Authored by researchers from institutions like MIT and the University of Oxford, the paper delves into how scaling up AI systems influences their inner workings, rather than just their performance outcomes.

The study compares traditional neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with those evolved via an open-ended search process, focusing on the task of generating a single image. This approach allows each neuron's function within the network to be visualized, offering a rare window into how these networks construct their outputs.

The findings reveal a stark difference between the two methods: SGD-trained networks often exhibit a disorganized structure, described as a "fractured entangled representation" (FER). This chaotic interior might hinder key capabilities like generalization and creativity. On the flip side, networks evolved through open-ended methods tend to sport more organized, unified representations.

This revelation raises important questions about the future of neural-network training approaches. Could managing or mitigating FER be crucial for advancing AI's representational capabilities?

For those interested in exploring the data and methodologies used in this research, the authors have shared their code on GitHub, complete with visualizations and supplementary data. It's a call to the community to dive deeper into understanding and possibly overcoming the limitations presented by FER, which might just be key to unlocking the more robust AI systems of tomorrow.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

1. **Interest and Critique of Conventional AI Approaches**:  
   Users highlight the paper’s significance for challenging the AI research community’s focus on scaling (e.g., model size, dataset size) and assuming larger/more data inherently leads to progress. Critics argue this “scale-first” mindset risks overemphasizing superficial metrics, especially in LLMs, at the cost of understanding how representations form internally.

2. **Fractured Representations and Generalization**:  
   The discussion emphasizes the paper’s argument that "fractured entangled representations" (FER) in SGD-trained networks might hinder generalization and creativity. This contrasts with open-evolved networks showing more coherent structures. A user questions how this applies practically to modern LLMs, speculating whether ad-hoc training methods inadvertently produce disorganized representations that limit reasoning or emergent capabilities.

3. **Calls for Deeper Investigation**:  
   Users debate whether LLMs truly build semantically organized representations or rely on statistical correlations, noting a need to analyze how training processes (e.g., SGD vs. open-ended search) shape internal structures. One user asks for concrete examples linking FER to real-world LLM behaviors (e.g., coding errors, summarization), but it’s clarified the paper doesn’t address this directly.

4. **Stylistic Reaction**:  
   A lighthearted comment mocks the paper’s complex title, reflecting broader tensions in how AI concepts are communicated.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion reveals enthusiasm for rethinking neural network training paradigms but underscores gaps in connecting theoretical hypotheses (like FER) to observed limitations in today's LLMs. Further empirical work is needed to determine whether addressing fractured representations could unlock new capabilities.

### 6. **Skepticism and Solutions**  
   - Some dismiss the study’s relevance, arguing that objective tests (e.g., tracking micro-movements during cognitive tasks) could better detect faking. Others call for stricter diagnostic protocols or AI-detection tools.  
   - Critiques of online ADHD diagnosis platforms (e.g., 10-question surveys) highlight systemic flaws in healthcare accessibility and oversight.  

### Key Takeaways:  
The discussion reflects a mix of alarm over AI’s role in undermining clinical assessments, frustration with regulatory bottlenecks, and resignation to societal pressures driving stimulant misuse. While some users advocate for systemic reforms (e.g., revising DEA quotas), others emphasize personal responsibility or improved diagnostic tools to address the issue.

### Allow us to block Copilot-generated issues (and PRs) from our own repositories

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/159749) | 62 points | by [pera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pera) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44038433)

GitHub is at the center of a lively debate as user "mcclure" raises concerns about a new feature that allows users to generate issues and pull requests using Copilot, the AI-powered coding assistant. This feature, which is in public preview, has sparked discussions among developers who worry about the potential influx of AI-generated submissions to their repositories.

Mcclure argues that these machine-generated issues and PRs could flood maintainers with low-quality content, wasting both developers' time and server resources. The user suggests GitHub implement an option to block AI-generated submissions, specifically targeting Copilot’s contributions. Without such measures, mcclure threatens drastic actions, like moving to platforms like Codeberg that do not integrate these AI tools.

The post has garnered significant attention, with many echoing mcclure's concerns and calling for the ability to block AI submissions. Meanwhile, a GitHub bot acknowledged the feedback, assuring users that their input is crucial and will guide future improvements, although immediate changes might not be implemented.

This development highlights ongoing tensions between traditional coding communities and the increasing use of AI tools in software development, sparking a wider conversation on balancing automation with human oversight.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion reflects developer concerns over GitHub's AI-generated PR/issue feature, with three key points:  

1. **Time Wastage & Low-Quality Submissions**: Users argue that AI-generated PRs (e.g., "fake PRs") waste maintainers' time, with one noting that even well-intentioned contributions can require significant effort to manage.  

2. **Calls for Opt-Out Tools**: Commenters demand GitHub to let maintainers block Copilot-generated content, warning that without such controls, the feature could affect up to 80% of repositories. Adoption rates and stakeholder input are highlighted as critical factors for GitHub to address.  

3. **Corporate Influence Concerns**: Skepticism about Microsoft’s ownership of GitHub resurfaces, with fears that corporate priorities (like pushing AI tools) may override community needs. Critics suggest Microsoft’s management could dismiss traditional open-source values, leading to friction with maintainers.  

The discussion underscores tensions between AI-driven automation and maintainer autonomy, emphasizing the need for GitHub to balance innovation with user-centric controls.
