In a poignant tale that blends adventure with tragedy, Charlie Kelly, an experienced hillwalker, went missing during a solo hike in the Scottish Highlands on September 6, 2023. Leaving his home in Tillicoultry with plans to conquer the peak of Creise, Kelly assured his partner, Emer Kennedy, that he was prepared for the journey. His messages throughout the day were upbeat, detailing his progress until they abruptly stopped after he indicated he could see the lights of the ski center near his parked car. 

As darkness descended, Kennedy's concern grew, leading to a massive search operation by Glencoe Mountain Rescue, involving helicopters, drones, and dozens of volunteers. Despite extensive efforts, no trace was found of Kelly until more than six weeks later. In a remarkable turn, two mountain rescue volunteers, Dan Roach and David Binks, harnessed their newly developed drone technology to assist in the search. Their involvement led to a breakthrough; the drones quickly located Kelly's body within an hour of deployment. 

The story highlights not only the risks associated with solo hiking but also showcases the extraordinary dedication of mountain rescue teams—comprised entirely of volunteers—who work tirelessly under challenging conditions. As they navigate both the emotional weight of such searches and the evolving technological landscape, the marriage of human skill and innovation proves essential in these life-or-death situations.

The discussion surrounding the tragic case of Charlie Kelly, the missing hillwalker, delves into multiple facets of search and rescue (SAR) operations, particularly the role of technology and the complexities of maritime rescue laws in Europe. Several commenters share insights on how advancements in drone technology have the potential to improve SAR operations, emphasizing the importance of volunteer rescue teams that often operate under challenging conditions.

One commenter reflects on the difficulties faced by SAR teams, noting that legal stipulations sometimes hinder their ability to conduct rescues, especially across borders. There are also discussions about the practical challenges and ethical dilemmas tied to drone use in SAR operations, including the risks posed by military and surveillance applications.

Others highlight the potential for drone-assisted SAR solutions, advocating for more innovative designs and technologies that can enhance search efforts and reduce response times. Some participants also touch upon the necessity for clear and legal frameworks governing rescue operations to ensure that help can be provided without restrictions.

### Sorbet: A neuromorphic hardware-compatible transformer-based spiking model

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15298) | 56 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [52 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41761699)

In the quest for energy-efficient language models suitable for edge devices, researchers have unveiled "Sorbet," a cutting-edge transformer-based spiking language model designed with neuromorphic hardware compatibility in mind. Crafted by Kaiwen Tang and colleagues, Sorbet tackles the challenging integration of energy-intensive operations like softmax and layer normalization, essential for traditional models but difficult to implement on neuromorphic systems.

To address these hurdles, the authors introduced innovative alternatives: PTsoftmax for softmax operations and bit-shifting power normalization (BSPN), both of which significantly reduce the energy footprint while maintaining strong performance. By employing knowledge distillation and model quantization, Sorbet achieves a highly compressed binary weight model without sacrificing efficacy.

Extensive testing on the GLUE benchmark highlights Sorbet's promise, positioning it as a viable solution for resource-constrained environments where privacy and energy efficiency are paramount. This work represents a significant milestone in making advanced language capabilities accessible even in low-power devices.
