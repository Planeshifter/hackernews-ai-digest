### Advancing AI Benchmarking with Game Arena

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/google-deepmind/kaggle-game-arena-updates/) | 129 points | by [salkahfi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=salkahfi) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46858873)

DeepMind expands Kaggle’s Game Arena beyond chess, adding Werewolf and poker to probe AI in messy, human-like settings where information is hidden and intentions can be deceptive.

- What’s new: Two imperfect‑information benchmarks—Werewolf (social deduction via natural-language play) and poker (risk/uncertainty and bluffing)—join chess.
- Why it matters: Real-world decisions aren’t chess. These games stress-test communication, negotiation, deception detection, and calibrated risk-taking—skills relevant to agentic assistants and safety.
- Safety angle: Werewolf provides a sandbox to study both spotting manipulation and responsibly constraining models’ capacity to deceive, without real-world stakes.
- Chess update: Leaderboards now include newer models; Gemini 3 Pro and 3 Flash lead, with play characterized by pattern-based “intuition” over brute-force search—closer to human strategic concepts.
- Live ops: Kaggle will host streamed tournaments with commentary; public leaderboards track progress over time.
- HN take: A cleaner lens on “social” and uncertainty reasoning than static benchmarks, but still vendor-run and game-bound—watch for overfitting, eval transparency, and how well skills transfer to real tasks.

**Hacker News Discussions:**

*   **Safety & Deception Concerns:** The inclusion of Werewolf sparked unease regarding AI safety. Several users questioned the wisdom of explicitly training models to master manipulation, lying, and social deduction. One commenter suggested Werewolf might serve better as a "negative benchmark," where a truly aligned model should refuse to engage in deception or perform poorly, while others noted that "confidently lying" is already a standard hallucination problem that models need to overcome.
*   **The "Tool Use" Debate:** A contentious thread debated how models should approach these games. While some argued that the ultimate test of intelligence is writing a program (like a chess engine) to solve the game rather than playing it via Chain-of-Thought (CoT), others countered that playing directly tests intrinsic reasoning and "imagination." Critics noted that relying on external tools (like calculators or engines) bypasses the measurement of a model's basline logic.
*   **Gemini’s Performance:** Users expressed skepticism regarding Gemini appearing at the top of the leaderboards. While some anecdotes confirmed Gemini performs well in specific coding or game contexts (like Mafia-arena), others felt there is a disconnect between its high benchmark scores and its perceived usability ("vibes") in daily real-world tasks compared to Claude or GPT-4.
*   **Benchmarking Validity:** There was technical discussion on the implementation of the games. Poker enthusiasts pointed out that 100 hands is statistically insignificant for measuring skill against GTO (Game Theory Optimal) play due to high variance; proper evaluation would require hundreds of thousands of hands.
*   **Comparisons to Past Bots:** Commenters reminisced about previous milestones like OpenAI Five (Dota 2) and AlphaStar. Some argued that visual, fully embodied agents (playing via screen input like a human) remain the "holy grail" for AGI, referencing NetHack and complex RPGs as better future benchmarks than text-based logic puzzles.

### Firefox Getting New Controls to Turn Off AI Features

#### [Submission URL](https://www.macrumors.com/2026/02/02/firefox-ai-toggle/) | 191 points | by [stalfosknight](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stalfosknight) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46864120)

Firefox adds a master “Block AI Enhancements” switch and granular controls

- What’s new: Starting with Firefox 148 (rolling out Feb 24), Mozilla is adding a master toggle to disable all current and future AI features, plus per-feature switches so you can pick and choose.
- What you can turn off:
  - Translations (in-page web translation)
  - Alt text generation in PDFs (accessibility descriptions for images)
  - AI-enhanced tab grouping (suggested related tabs and group names)
  - Link previews (key points before opening a link)
  - Sidebar AI chatbot integrations (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Le Chat Mistral)
- How it works: Flip the single “Block AI Enhancements” control to disable every AI feature and suppress prompts/pop-ups for new ones, or disable features individually.
- Why it matters: Mozilla is still shipping AI for users who want it, but is foregrounding user agency and a clean opt-out—something many users have been asking browsers to provide.

**Firefox adds a master “Block AI Enhancements” switch and granular controls**

**The News:**
Mozilla is introducing a centralized "Block AI Enhancements" toggle in Firefox 148 (rolling out Feb 24). This master switch allows users to disable all current and future AI integrations—including chatbots, PDF alt-text generation, and tab grouping—and prevents prompts for new features. This move highlights Mozilla's focus on user agency and providing a clean opt-out mechanism, distinguishing it from competitors who often force-feed AI features.

**Discussion Summary:**

The conversation on Hacker News focuses heavily on the friction between "modern" browser features and user desires for a minimal, private utility. While users appreciate the opt-out switch, the prevailing sentiment is that Firefox requires too much configuration to become usable.

*   **The "De-bloating" Ritual:** A significant portion of the thread is dedicated to the immediate "cleanup" checklist power users perform upon installing Firefox. Users shared extensive lists of features they immediately disable, including Pocket, weather, sponsored shortcuts, telemetry, and now AI. One commenter described the default state as "super stupid," arguing that while Firefox is great, it takes serious work to strip it down to a respectful tool.
*   **Automation and Config Fatigue:** leading off the complaints about defaults, users discussed methods to automate this configuration process. Suggestions included using `user.js` files, projects like "Betterfox," or NixOS configurations to avoid manually toggling dozens of settings on every install.
*   **Privacy vs. Usability:** There is a debate regarding what "privacy-first" actually means. Some users argued Firefox should default to spoofing hardware (screen size, fonts) like the "Arkenfox" user.js profile does. Others pushed back, noting that aggressive spoofing often breaks web functionality (e.g., serving the wrong language or breaking layouts), suggesting that the current defaults strike a necessary balance for the average user.
*   **The "Just a Renderer" Dream:** Several commenters expressed a desire for a browser that strictly handles HTML/CSS/JS execution and leaves ancillary features (bookmarks, passwords, AI) to external plugins or the OS. They view bundled features as "bloat" similar to IDEs that try to do too much.
*   **The "Plunger" Analogy:** Opinions were split on the new AI toggle itself. While some praised Mozilla for offering a choice that Google and Microsoft do not, others were less charitable. One user analogized the situation to finding a clogged toilet: while being handed a plunger (the toggle) is helpful, they would prefer the mess wasn't there in the first place. Conversely, defenders noted that in the current tech climate, a mainstream browser offering a total AI kill-switch is a significant and welcome differentiator.
*   **Security Concerns:** A specific technical concern was raised regarding extension security; users noted that some AI integrations might require disabling extension sandboxing, which they view as a dangerous trade-off.

### Nano-vLLM: How a vLLM-style inference engine works

#### [Submission URL](https://neutree.ai/blog/nano-vllm-part-1) | 266 points | by [yz-yu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yz-yu) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46855447)

Architecture, scheduling, and the path from prompt to token: a minimal vLLM you can actually read

What it is
- A two-part deep dive into LLM inference internals using Nano-vLLM, a ~1,200-line Python implementation that distills core ideas from vLLM.
- Built by a DeepSeek contributor (on the DeepSeek-V3 and R1 reports). Despite its size, it includes prefix caching, tensor parallelism, CUDA graph compilation, and Torch compile optimizations.
- Benchmarks reportedly match or slightly exceed vLLM, making it a practical learning and reference engine.

Part 1 highlights (engineering architecture)
- End-to-end flow: prompts → tokenizer → sequences (token ID arrays) → scheduler → batched GPU steps → streaming outputs.
- Producer–consumer design: add_request enqueues work; a step loop consumes and executes batches, decoupling intake from GPU execution.
- Batching trade-off: bigger batches amortize kernel/memory overhead for higher throughput but tie latency to the slowest sequence in the batch.
- Two phases to treat differently:
  - Prefill: process all input tokens to build state (no user-visible output).
  - Decode: generate one token per step (streamed output), with very different compute/memory patterns.
- Scheduler mechanics: waiting and running queues; a Block Manager allocates resources (notably KV cache) before a sequence runs; batches are assembled per step with an action (prefill or decode).
- Resource pressure: discusses behavior when KV cache/memory is constrained and how scheduling decisions adapt.

Why it matters
- Demystifies what sits under APIs like OpenAI/Claude and how scheduling/batching shape your latency, throughput, and cost.
- Offers a compact codebase to understand and tweak essentials like prefix caching, batch sizing, and decode-time scheduling.
- Part 2 will dig into the compute guts: attention, KV cache internals, and tensor parallelism.

Here is the summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**The "AI-Generated" Controversy**
The discussion was primarily dominated by an accusation from user `jbrrw` that the article and derived codebase appeared to be "AI written and generated" and factually incorrect. The commenter argued that the code failed to explicitly mention "PagedAttention" despite claiming to cover vLLM internals and noted discrepancies between the article's promise (Dense vs. MoE) and the hardcoded implementation (Qwen3).

**The Author’s Defense**
The author (`yz-y`) responded directly, clarifying their process:
*   **Human Understanding:** They are a developer with an ML background using this project to fill knowledge gaps, evidenced by hand-drawn Excalidraw diagrams and the logic behind the code (which implements Paged KV caching concepts even if not explicitly named "PagedAttention").
*   **Language Barrier:** As a non-native English speaker, they admitted to using LLMs to fix grammar and readability after drafting the content themselves, arguing this is "AI-assisted" rather than "AI-generated."

**Meta-Debate on Writing Style**
The thread devolved into a debate about the "forensics" of detecting AI text.
*   Some users scrutinized the use of **em-dashes (—)** and "falsely polished" tones as indicators of LLM output.
*   Others (`CodeMage`, `_alternator_`) argued that professional technical writing often sounds neutral and that penalizing proper punctuation or grammar checks hurts non-native speakers.
*   User `rhth` lamented that the technical substance of the post was drowning in a "witch hunt," noting the irony of attacking a clear technical explainer while claiming to defend human quality.

**Technical Reception**
Despite the derailment, a few users praised the project. `OsamaJaber` and `blmg` appreciated the "Nano" approach to complex systems (similar to "Nano-Kubernetes"), noting that vLLM's actual codebase is massive and difficult to parse for beginners.

### Claude Code is suddenly everywhere inside Microsoft

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/tech/865689/microsoft-claude-code-anthropic-partnership-notepad) | 384 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [510 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854999)

Microsoft is quietly standardizing on Claude Code — even as it sells GitHub Copilot

- Microsoft is encouraging thousands of employees, including non-developers, to install and use Anthropic’s Claude Code. Teams involved include CoreAI and the Experiences + Devices division (Windows, M365, Teams, Surface), with approval to use it across Business and Industry Copilot codebases.
- Engineers are expected to run Claude Code alongside GitHub Copilot and provide head-to-head feedback. If internal pilots go well, Microsoft could offer Claude Code directly to Azure customers.
- Microsoft has deepened ties with Anthropic: it’s counting Anthropic model sales toward Azure quotas, giving Foundry customers access to Claude Sonnet 4.5/Opus 4.1/Haiku 4.5, and Anthropic has committed to $30B in Azure spend.
- Claude models are increasingly favored inside Microsoft 365 and Copilot features where they outperform OpenAI’s models. Microsoft still says OpenAI remains its primary frontier-model partner.
- Why it matters: Microsoft’s embrace of Claude Code signals a pragmatic, mixed-model strategy and a push to let nontechnical staff prototype and even commit code—potentially accelerating development while adding pressure to junior developer roles and raising questions about Copilot’s primacy inside Microsoft.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion focuses heavily on Microsoft’s confusing and repetitive branding strategy rather than the technical merits of Claude Code versus GitHub Copilot.

*   **"Copilot" as the new ".NET":** Commenters ridiculed Microsoft's tendency to dilute brand names by applying them to unrelated products. Users noted that "Copilot" now refers to distinct code completion tools, office assistants, search engines, and hardware buttons, drawing comparisons to previous eras where Microsoft labeled everything "Live," "One," or ".NET" (and the notoriously confusing Xbox naming scheme).
*   **Internal Politics vs. User Clarity:** Several participants argued that this naming dysfunction is a result of effective internal "empire building." The theory is that middle managers are incentivized to attach their specific products to the company’s current flagship brand (currently Copilot) to secure funding and promotions, regardless of the confusion it causes consumers.
*   **Enterprise Procurement Strategy:** A counter-argument suggested this branding is a calculated move to streamline B2B sales. By grouping disparate tools under one "Copilot" umbrella, Microsoft makes it easier for limitation-heavy corporate legal and procurement departments to sign off on new tools once the brand name is approved.
*   **Degraded Performance:** Anecdotes emerged regarding the quality of these "wrapper" products. One user noted that while the underlying models (OpenAI) are capable, the "Microsoft 365 Copilot" implementation (specifically in Excel) often fails at tasks the raw models can handle easily, suggesting the integration layer is crippling the AI's utility.
*   **Cultural References:** The thread revived the classic "Microsoft Re-Designs the iPod Packaging" video, using it to illustrate the company’s propensity for clutter and bureaucratic design choices.

### Nvidia shares are down after report that its OpenAI investment stalled

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/nvidia-stock-price-openai-funding.html) | 144 points | by [greatgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=greatgib) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46860964)

Nvidia slips as its $100B OpenAI mega-deal looks less certain

- What happened: Nvidia fell about 1.1% Monday morning after reports that its plan to invest up to $100 billion in OpenAI is stalled.
- The original plan: Announced in September—at least 10 GW of compute for OpenAI plus an investment of up to $100B.
- The wobble: WSJ reported Jensen Huang told associates the $100B figure was nonbinding and criticized OpenAI’s business discipline, with competitive concerns around Google (Alphabet) and Anthropic.
- Huang’s weekend stance: Called claims he’s unhappy with OpenAI “nonsense,” said Nvidia will make a “huge” investment—its largest ever—but reiterated it won’t exceed $100B. “Sam is closing the round, and we will absolutely be involved.”
- Why investors care: The back-and-forth injects uncertainty over the final dollar amount and terms. CNBC’s Sarah Kunst noted the unusual public negotiation and that “the AI revenue everyone expected still isn’t there.”
- Analyst read: Wedbush’s Dan Ives frames this as negotiation theater and a guard against “circular financing” optics (AI firms investing in one another). He still expects something near the “$100 billion zip code.”
- Bottom line: Nvidia says it’s in, but the size and structure are fluid. Until terms are nailed down, expect scrutiny on how much capital flows to OpenAI—and how that ripples across rivals and AI profitability narratives.

**Discussion Summary:**

Financial skepticism dominates the discussion, with users heavily scrutinizing the mechanics of the deal and the broader stability of the AI market.

*   **Circular Financing Accusations:** Multiple users conceptualize the deal as "circular financing" or "round-tripping." The prevailing view is that Nvidia investing in OpenAI is essentially a convoluted discount on hardware, as the capital will immediately flow back to Nvidia to purchase chips (which have ~70% margins). Comparisons were drawn to Enron, with one user noting this looks like "companies cooking books" to boost revenue figures.
*   **Market "Volcano" & Azure Anxiety:** Commenters point to Microsoft’s recent 10% stock drop (triggered by a minor 0.4% miss on Azure growth) as evidence that the market is jittery and "primed to sell." One user described the current climate as "sitting on a volcano," arguing that massive Capex spending is being met with scrutiny rather than blind optimism.
*   **Loss of OpenAI’s "Moat":** There is significant debate over whether OpenAI retains a technical lead. Users argue that the gap has narrowed significantly, with competitors like Google (Gemini), Anthropic, xAI (Grok), and open-source models (DeepSeek) achieving parity. Some suggest the lack of recent "foundational" breakthroughs implies hitting a point of diminishing returns.
*   **Systemic Risks (Softbank & CoreWeave):** The conversation extends to related entities. Concerns were raised about Softbank’s leverage regarding ARM (allegedly using stock as collateral) and CoreWeave’s recent legal issues, suggesting a fragile web of financing supporting the AI hardware sector.
*   **Consumer vs. B2B Economics:** A sub-thread argues that current B2B AI margins are unsustainable due to high inference/training costs. Some users believe the industry needs to pivot toward consumer entertainment (like NovelAI) to find reliable revenue, while others hope an industry collapse will finally normalize consumer GPU prices (DDR/graphics cards).

### Waymo seeking about $16B near $110B valuation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-31/waymo-seeking-about-16-billion-near-110-billion-valuation) | 212 points | by [JumpCrisscross](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=JumpCrisscross) | [319 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46856854)

Waymo is targeting a roughly $16 billion funding round that would value Alphabet’s robotaxi unit near $110 billion, per Bloomberg’s sources. Alphabet would supply about $13 billion of the total, with the remainder coming from outside backers including Sequoia Capital, DST Global, Dragoneer, and Mubadala Capital.

Why it matters:
- Scale-up cash: Robotaxi services are capital hungry (fleets, sensors, AI compute, mapping, operations). This is one of the largest private raises in autonomy to date.
- Alphabet doubles down: With Google’s parent providing the bulk of funds, Waymo remains strategically core rather than a spun-out bet.
- Investor vote of confidence: Blue-chip VCs and Mubadala (a prior Waymo backer) re-upping suggests renewed conviction in a market where rivals have stumbled.

Context:
- Waymo has been expanding driverless ride-hailing in select U.S. cities and is seen as the sector’s front-runner after competitors faced safety and regulatory setbacks.
- A ~$110B valuation would put Waymo among the world’s most valuable private tech companies, reflecting expectations that robotaxis could become a major transportation platform if they scale safely and broadly.

Note: Terms aren’t final; details come from people familiar with the talks.

**Discussion Summary:**

*   **The User Experience:** Several commenters expressed a strong preference for Waymo’s driving style, noting that autonomous vehicles follow traffic laws, stick to speed limits, and eliminate the stress of aggressive braking or acceleration common with human drivers. Users also highlighted the relief of avoiding forced small talk and the utility of the service for safely transporting children. Conversely, one user argued that they enjoy the "humanity" and chats associated with traditional taxi drivers.
*   **Labor & Displacement:** A significant portion of the discussion focused on the economic implications of replacing millions of human drivers. While some viewed this as inevitable technological progress (akin to the mechanization of farming) or a solution to looming demographic-induced labor shortages, others worried about wealth inequality and the lack of safety nets (like UBI) for displaced workers.
*   **Working Conditions:** There was a specific debate regarding the dignity of the driving profession, initiated by comments about drivers having to urinate in bottles due to a lack of public infrastructure. A former driver chimed in to say that while the bathroom issue is exaggerated, the real difficulty lies in dealing with difficult passengers and low pay.
*   **Transit Gaps:** Commenters noted that in cities like San Francisco, robotaxis are filling specific gaps where public transit coverage is poor or disjointed, making the higher cost worth the time saved compared to buses or trains.

### Are we dismissing AI spend before the 6x lands? (2025)

#### [Submission URL](https://martinalderson.com/posts/are-we-dismissing-ai-spend-before-the-6x-lands/) | 20 points | by [ukuina](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ukuina) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46852855)

TL;DR: “AI scaling is over” is premature. A massive, already-allocated wave of compute is only now starting to hit, with visible capability jumps lagging the hardware by months.

What’s new
- CoWoS ramp: Morgan Stanley’s look at TSMC’s CoWoS capacity (the advanced packaging behind most top AI chips) projects supply rising from ~117k wafers in 2023 to ~1M in 2026e.
  - Share split (2026e): Nvidia ~60%, Broadcom (Google TPUs) ~15%, AMD ~11%, AWS/Alchip ~5%, Marvell ~6%, others small.
- Napkin exaFLOPs: Converting that capacity to training compute suggests new installs rising from ~6.2 EF (2023) to ~122.6 EF (2026e). Cumulatively, that’s roughly a 6x global capacity increase from 2024 to 2026—and nearly 50x since ChatGPT launched by end of 2026.
  - Caveat: TPU ramp is aggressive and the mix is uncertain; these are estimates.

Why you aren’t seeing it yet
- Deployment lag: Chips finished at TSMC typically take at least a month (often more) before they’re online; then training cycles add ~6 months end-to-end. Today’s model quality mostly reflects last year’s infrastructure.
- Physical bottlenecks: Nvidia’s GB200/Blackwell-class parts need liquid cooling; reports of thermal/cooling issues have slowed rollouts. Power is the bigger governor—gigawatts of new capacity are required, constraining how fast 2026e gets real.
- Inference eats capacity: An increasing share goes to serving users. Off-peak windows get repurposed for things like agentic RL, but training remains the big cost center (echoed by OpenAI’s comment that it would be profitable absent training).

Early capability signals
- Opus 4.5 and Gemini 3 stand out: Opus 4.5 + Claude Code can sustain 30+ minutes of software engineering with minimal babysitting; Gemini 3 shows unusually strong graphic/UI design abilities.
- Benchmarks: Opus 4.5 + Claude Code reportedly “solves” a Princeton HAL agent task; METR finds models running autonomously for longer. These feel like the first fruits of the new compute wave rather than its peak.

Takeaway
- The narrative that scaling has stalled is judging models trained on last-gen hardware. A 6x compute wave is queued up; power/cooling/logistics mean the impact lands with delay. Expect the bigger step-ups to materialize through 2025–2026—exciting, and a little scary.

Discussion revolves around the practical implications of the projected compute ramp, ranging from data bottlenecks to actual use cases for the hardware.

*   **Data vs. Compute:** Users debate whether a 6x increase in compute matters if training data is already saturated; skeptics argue companies have exhausted natural data, while others counter that existing datasets haven't been fully leveraged yet.
*   **Utility over Superintelligence:** Several commenters argue that the return on investment won't necessarily be "superintelligence," but rather drastic improvements in UX, accessibility, and reliable AI assistants (referencing MCP). The focus is on using LLMs to make software less brittle and commerce smoother.
*   **Resource Allocation:** There is speculation on where the staggering resources will actually go. While some are excited about "cheap tokens" solving problems through volume, others extrapolate historical software trends to predict the compute will be consumed by high-demand generative tasks, such as higher-resolution and longer-duration video.
*   **Meta-commentary:** One user suspects the submitted article itself may be AI-generated, citing repetitive phrasing.

### Microsoft is walking back Windows 11's AI overload

#### [Submission URL](https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/windows-11/microsoft-is-reevaluating-its-ai-efforts-on-windows-11-plans-to-reduce-copilot-integrations-and-evolve-recall) | 203 points | by [jsheard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jsheard) | [276 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46854951)

Report: Microsoft is pulling back Windows 11’s “AI everywhere” push after user backlash

According to Windows Central’s Zac Bowden, Microsoft is reevaluating how AI shows up in Windows 11. After a year of negative feedback—sparked by the Recall privacy debacle and a flood of Copilot buttons in core apps—the company is said to be:
- Pausing new Copilot button rollouts in in-box apps and reviewing existing integrations (like Notepad and Paint). Some may be removed or quietly de-branded.
- Reworking Windows Recall. Internally, the current approach is viewed as a failure; Microsoft is exploring a redesign and may even drop the name.
- Continuing under-the-hood AI efforts: Semantic Search, Agentic Workspace, Windows ML, and Windows AI APIs are still moving forward.

Why it matters: This looks like a shift from “AI everywhere” to “AI where it makes sense,” an attempt to rebuild trust and reduce UI clutter while keeping the platform AI-capable for developers.

Caveats: The report relies on unnamed sources. The pause may be temporary, and a branding cleanup could mask similar functionality. Microsoft’s broader “agentic OS” ambitions don’t appear dead—just slowed and refocused.

What to watch: Insider builds that remove or rename Copilot hooks, a redesigned Recall with stronger privacy defaults, and continued API/ML announcements aimed at devs.

Based on the comments, the discussion attributes Microsoft’s "AI everywhere" stumble to misaligned corporate incentives rather than simple incompetence. Users argue that Product Managers and executives are acting as "career sprinters," forcing AI features into the OS to secure promotions and satisfy top-down hype mandates, even if it degrades the user experience.

Key themes in the discussion include:

*   **Incentive Structures:** Commenters suggest the aggressive roadmap was driven by employees needing to "ship" shiny features to demonstrate impact, prioritizing short-term stock value over the long-term health of the Windows brand.
*   **Marketing Over Engineering:** There is widespread frustration with "Marketing Driven Development." Users mock Microsoft's tendency to slap the current buzzword (currently "Copilot," formerly "Azure" or ".NET") onto unrelated products, diluting established brands like Office.
*   **Organizational Focus:** Some note that moving the Windows division under the Azure/AI organization shifted priorities away from making a stable OS toward creating an AI delivery vehicle, fueling "enshittification" and driving users toward Linux or macOS.
*   **Technical Debates:** A sidebar discussion explores Microsoft's attempt to force AI into the .NET ecosystem (Blazor, PowerShell, etc.), with users debating whether this is a genuine upgrade or a desperate attempt to catch up to Python’s dominance in the ML space.

### Police facial recognition is now highly accurate, but public awareness lags

#### [Submission URL](https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-technology-used-by-police-is-now-very-accurate-but-public-understanding-lags-behind-274652) | 25 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46859957)

UK to expand police facial recognition; researchers say accuracy is high but public understanding lags

- Policy shift: England and Wales plan a major scale-up of police facial recognition—live facial recognition (LFR) vans rising from 10 to 50, £26m for a national FR system plus £11.6m for LFR, announced before a 12-week public consultation concludes.
- Claimed impact: The Home Secretary says FR has already contributed to 1,700 arrests in London’s Met Police.
- How police use it today:
  - Retrospective FR (all forces): match faces from CCTV/stills against databases to identify suspects.
  - Live FR (13 of 43 forces): scan public spaces to locate wanted or missing people.
  - Operator-initiated FR (2 forces, South Wales and Gwent): mobile app lets officers capture a photo during a stop and check it against a watchlist.
- Accuracy claims:
  - NIST’s top algorithms show false negatives under 1% with false positives around 0.3% (lab evaluations).
  - UK National Physical Laboratory reports the system used by UK police returns the correct identity 99% of the time (on database searches).
  - Human face-matching error rates in standard tests are far higher (about a third).
- Bias trend: Earlier systems showed much higher error rates for non‑white faces (e.g., a 2018 study), but the authors say more recent systems used in the UK/US have largely closed those gaps thanks to better training data and modern deep CNNs.
- Public knowledge gap: Only ~10% of people in England and Wales feel confident they know how/when FR is used (up from 2020, when many saw it as sci‑fi). The survey cited is not yet peer reviewed.
- Beyond policing: Some UK retailers use FR to spot repeat shoplifters, adding to concerns about scope and oversight.
- Why it matters to HN: The UK is moving toward nationwide operational deployment at scale, not pilots. Real‑world error rates, threshold choices, watchlist composition, and governance will determine harm from false positives—especially as LFR expands before consultation ends.

https://theconversation.com/facial-recognition-technology-used-by-police-is-now-very-accurate-but-public-understanding-lags-behind-274652

**The Base Rate Problem:** The primary critique focused on the statistical reality of "99% accuracy." Commenters noted that if police conduct millions of scans daily, a 1% error rate still results in tens of thousands of wrongful identifications every day. Users highlighted that because the number of wanted criminals is tiny compared to the general population, false positives will "massively outweigh" true positives.

**Intimidation vs. Utility:** One user shared anecdotal experiences walking past these scanners, suggesting they serve to intimidate the public rather than actually catch criminals. They noted seeing young people intentionally obscuring their faces (masks) without being stopped, while the system effectively polices ordinary time.

**Rights and Real-World Failures:** The discussion touched on the human cost of errors. Participants cited examples involving US immigration enforcement (ICE) where facial recognition reportedly failed repeatedly against a citizen despite physical proof of citizenship. Ideally, users argued, a system that systematically violates rights—even just "1% of the time"—should be viewed as unacceptable rather than accurate.
