### DeepRAG: Thinking to retrieval step by step for large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01142) | 181 points | by [fofoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fofoz) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932948)

In an exciting development for the realm of Artificial Intelligence, a new paper titled "DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models" has been published on arXiv. Penned by Xinyan Guan and eight other authors, this research explores a novel framework called DeepRAG that could potentially elevate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Despite their prowess in reasoning, LLMs still grapple with "factual hallucinations" stemming from issues like outdated or inaccurate knowledge. Current approaches combining reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often struggle due to inefficient task division and superfluous retrieval processes that introduce noise and compromise response quality.

DeepRAG is introduced as a solution to these challenges, modeling retrieval-driven reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This approach allows for strategic and adaptive knowledge retrieval, crucially enabling dynamic query decomposition. Essentially, DeepRAG can decide step-by-step whether to source external data or rely on internal reasoning, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Impressively, experiments demonstrate that DeepRAG enhances retrieval efficiency and boosts answer accuracy by nearly 22%. This noteworthy improvement underscores its efficacy in refining retrieval-augmented reasoning processes and marks a significant stride in AI development. For those interested in the nitty-gritty, the full paper is accessible on arXiv under the identifier arXiv:2502.01142 [cs.AI].

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the DeepRAG paper highlights practical challenges, critiques, and alternative approaches to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Key themes include:

1. **Challenges with Existing RAG Tools:**
   - Users express frustration with simplistic RAG implementations (e.g., LangChain) for complex tasks, citing inefficiencies like redundant retrieval passes, latency, and noise from poorly chunked documents.
   - Specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical) struggle with general-purpose tools due to jargon and the need for precise context, often requiring thousands of annotated examples or expert input.

2. **Chunking Strategies & Custom Workflows:**
   - Effective document chunking (e.g., semantic or hierarchical splitting) is critical. Custom strategies (e.g., grouping tables, paragraphs, or technical specs) are emphasized over generic approaches.
   - Tools like `semantifly` (for agent workflows), `chunkify`, and `tl;dw` (a chunking library) are recommended. Some users advocate for AI models that parse PDFs with layout awareness (e.g., MathPix).

3. **Alternatives to Standard RAG:**
   - **graphRAG** (cited by Gartner) and methods leveraging folder structures/metadata for context are proposed as advanced alternatives.
   - Local models (via Ollama, Cursor) and minimalist frameworks are preferred by some, avoiding bloated tools like LangChain.

4. **Skepticism Toward DeepRAG's Claims:**
   - While DeepRAG’s 22% accuracy boost is noted, users question the reproducibility of results and critique the paper's phrasing ("Markov Decision Process") as jargon-heavy. Some stress that real-world RAG success hinges on implementation specifics beyond theoretical frameworks.

5. **Unique Success Cases:**
   - One user highlights success using Qwen’s multimodal model and base64 encoding to parse PDFs, while others emphasize the role of domain-specific fine-tuning and explicit metadata tagging.

Overall, the discussion underscores that while frameworks like DeepRAG aim to advance RAG, practical deployment requires careful chunking, domain adaptation, and often eschewing popular tools in favor of bespoke solutions.

### Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing

#### [Submission URL](https://radfoam.github.io) | 195 points | by [w-m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=w-m) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42931109)

Radiant Foam is breaking new ground in the field of real-time differentiable ray tracing by offering a novel approach that maintains the efficiency and quality of Gaussian Splatting but circumvents its drawbacks. Developed by a team from Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Google Deepmind, this model leverages an overlooked volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm from yesteryears, hailed for its simplicity and effectiveness in traversing complex scenes with ease.

At the heart of Radiant Foam lies the clever use of Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. By structuring data points into a Voronoi diagram, the model simplifies the traditionally cumbersome process of ray tracing. It efficiently computes ray-cell intersections and navigates seamlessly through three-dimensional space, much like jumping from cell to cell in a beautifully orchestrated dance. This approach sidesteps the usual pitfalls of rasterization, such as difficulty in simulating light phenomena like reflection and refraction.

What sets Radiant Foam apart is its ability to perform without reliance on specialized hardware or APIs, needing only a standard programmable GPU. This makes it accessible and versatile, promising real-time ray tracing outcomes that don't sacrifice speed for visual fidelity. The method also gracefully bypasses the optimization challenges of discrete meshes, thanks to the continuous nature of Voronoi cell boundaries.

In a nutshell, Radiant Foam achieves what seemed elusive: bringing together the speed of rasterization with the precision of ray tracing in one comprehensive, real-time differentiable model. By doing so, it paves the way for more dynamic and flexible computer vision applications that offer high-quality renderings without breaking the computational bank.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Radiant Foam Research:**

1. **Camera Model Debates:**  
   Users analyzed how Radiant Foam handles non-pinhole cameras (e.g., fisheye lenses), with some pointing out challenges in projecting curved lines compared to traditional pinhole models. While Gaussian Splatting can approximate distortions, critics raised concerns about its limitations under extreme distortion or when relying on approximations that might "break" the method.

2. **Algorithm Efficiency & Bottlenecks:**  
   Questions arose about computational efficiency, particularly whether the method avoids slow hierarchical acceleration structures (e.g., BVH). Skeptics noted that ray tracing algorithms often struggle with divergence in parallel architectures (e.g., SIMD), but supporters highlighted the novelty of Radiant Foam’s approach.

3. **Corporate Involvement & Applications:**  
   Google’s role drew mixed reactions. Some praised the team's "radiant foam" techniques, while others questioned affiliations (e.g., part-time researchers or overcrediting). Notably, users observed similarities to existing Google Maps features (e.g., Gaussian Splatting in 3D fly-throughs). Speculation also arose about future AR integration, though skepticism lingered about hardware constraints (e.g., Pixel phones lacking lidar).

4. **Research Validity & Critique:**  
   The paper faced criticism for allegedly glossing over flaws and comparing poorly to general-purpose techniques. Defenders countered that research often operates within practical constraints. A recurring theme was the tension between academic novelty and real-world applicability, with one user calling the results "hyper-real" but others urging deeper scrutiny.

### How I use LLMs as a staff engineer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) | 234 points | by [gfysfm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gfysfm) | [180 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409)

The debate around the utility of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering is hotter than ever. Some engineers hail these AI tools as revolutionary, while others dismiss them as hyped-up distractions. But according to a staff engineer's insights, the real key might be using these models correctly. He shares his experiences on how LLMs, particularly GitHub Copilot, have transformed his workflow.

For writing production code, Copilot serves as a powerful autocomplete tool, filling in boilerplate code and occasionally assisting in unfamiliar areas, like Golang or C. Though it's risky to rely heavily on AI in less-familiar domains without expert review, it boosts efficiency significantly for tactical changes.

When it comes to throwaway code, the engineer liberally uses LLMs. For non-production research tasks, AI speeds up processes like data classification and pattern recognition, halving the time needed.

LLMs also shine as on-demand tutors for learning new areas. By engaging in interactive dialogue, the engineer has leveraged them to grasp new domains, like Unity, quickly and effectively.

For bug fixes, while LLMs aren't perfect, sometimes they spot overlooked issues, offering a potential solution with minimal effort. However, they aren't surpassing human bug-hunting skills just yet.

In terms of drafting written documents such as ADRs and technical summaries, LLMs are used for proofreading rather than writing. They effectively catch typos and suggest insightful edits, although their style advice is often set aside.

In summary, he uses LLMs for:
- Smart autocomplete and initial drafts for less-familiar languages
- Rapid development of disposable research scripts
- Learning new technologies through Q&A
- Occasional debugging checks
- Proofreading for typos in technical writing

But he refrains from letting AI handle:
- Complete pull requests in domains he's confident in
- Writing formal documents or conducting extensive codebase research

With proper use, LLMs can still be a valuable tool in a software engineer's kit, offering enhanced productivity and new learning opportunities.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reveals polarized views on LLMs' role in software engineering:
- **Supportive Views:**  
  Some developers (e.g., smnw) argue LLMs boost productivity in drafting code, learning new skills, and debugging when used responsibly. Corporate push for AI adoption is seen as aligning with efficiency goals.  

- **Critiques and Concerns:**  
  Others (e.g., tprrls) warn that over-reliance on LLMs risks degraded code quality, non-deterministic outputs, and eroded craftsmanship. Skeptics highlight executives’ misguided focus on AI as a cost-saving trend rather than understanding its limitations.  

- **Job Market and Skill Impact:**  
  Debates emerge about LLMs commoditizing coding skills, potentially saturating the job market (nyarlathotep_) or leading to demands for 10x productivity (Jevons Paradox, per kk). Codr7 and dasil003 stress that deep system design and business logic remain human-exclusive challenges.  

- **Corporate Dynamics:**  
  Criticisms target executives’ short-term AI investments (Yoric) and pressure on developers to adopt tools without clear ROI (gbx). Fear of job displacement persists, though rebuttals note LLMs complement, not replace, skilled engineers.  

- **Technical Limitations:**  
  While LLMs aid boilerplate, their inability to grasp context (th0ma5) or ensure reliability (tkyy) underscores the need for human oversight.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The thread reflects tension between LLMs as productivity enhancers and existential threats, emphasizing responsible integration over blind adoption.
