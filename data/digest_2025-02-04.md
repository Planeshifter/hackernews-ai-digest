### DeepRAG: Thinking to retrieval step by step for large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01142) | 181 points | by [fofoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fofoz) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932948)

In an exciting development for the realm of Artificial Intelligence, a new paper titled "DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models" has been published on arXiv. Penned by Xinyan Guan and eight other authors, this research explores a novel framework called DeepRAG that could potentially elevate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Despite their prowess in reasoning, LLMs still grapple with "factual hallucinations" stemming from issues like outdated or inaccurate knowledge. Current approaches combining reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often struggle due to inefficient task division and superfluous retrieval processes that introduce noise and compromise response quality.

DeepRAG is introduced as a solution to these challenges, modeling retrieval-driven reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This approach allows for strategic and adaptive knowledge retrieval, crucially enabling dynamic query decomposition. Essentially, DeepRAG can decide step-by-step whether to source external data or rely on internal reasoning, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Impressively, experiments demonstrate that DeepRAG enhances retrieval efficiency and boosts answer accuracy by nearly 22%. This noteworthy improvement underscores its efficacy in refining retrieval-augmented reasoning processes and marks a significant stride in AI development. For those interested in the nitty-gritty, the full paper is accessible on arXiv under the identifier arXiv:2502.01142 [cs.AI].

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the DeepRAG paper highlights practical challenges, critiques, and alternative approaches to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Key themes include:

1. **Challenges with Existing RAG Tools:**
   - Users express frustration with simplistic RAG implementations (e.g., LangChain) for complex tasks, citing inefficiencies like redundant retrieval passes, latency, and noise from poorly chunked documents.
   - Specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical) struggle with general-purpose tools due to jargon and the need for precise context, often requiring thousands of annotated examples or expert input.

2. **Chunking Strategies & Custom Workflows:**
   - Effective document chunking (e.g., semantic or hierarchical splitting) is critical. Custom strategies (e.g., grouping tables, paragraphs, or technical specs) are emphasized over generic approaches.
   - Tools like `semantifly` (for agent workflows), `chunkify`, and `tl;dw` (a chunking library) are recommended. Some users advocate for AI models that parse PDFs with layout awareness (e.g., MathPix).

3. **Alternatives to Standard RAG:**
   - **graphRAG** (cited by Gartner) and methods leveraging folder structures/metadata for context are proposed as advanced alternatives.
   - Local models (via Ollama, Cursor) and minimalist frameworks are preferred by some, avoiding bloated tools like LangChain.

4. **Skepticism Toward DeepRAG's Claims:**
   - While DeepRAG’s 22% accuracy boost is noted, users question the reproducibility of results and critique the paper's phrasing ("Markov Decision Process") as jargon-heavy. Some stress that real-world RAG success hinges on implementation specifics beyond theoretical frameworks.

5. **Unique Success Cases:**
   - One user highlights success using Qwen’s multimodal model and base64 encoding to parse PDFs, while others emphasize the role of domain-specific fine-tuning and explicit metadata tagging.

Overall, the discussion underscores that while frameworks like DeepRAG aim to advance RAG, practical deployment requires careful chunking, domain adaptation, and often eschewing popular tools in favor of bespoke solutions.

Radiant Foam is breaking new ground in the field of real-time differentiable ray tracing by offering a novel approach that maintains the efficiency and quality of Gaussian Splatting but circumvents its drawbacks. Developed by a team from Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Google Deepmind, this model leverages an overlooked volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm from yesteryears, hailed for its simplicity and effectiveness in traversing complex scenes with ease.

At the heart of Radiant Foam lies the clever use of Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. By structuring data points into a Voronoi diagram, the model simplifies the traditionally cumbersome process of ray tracing. It efficiently computes ray-cell intersections and navigates seamlessly through three-dimensional space, much like jumping from cell to cell in a beautifully orchestrated dance. This approach sidesteps the usual pitfalls of rasterization, such as difficulty in simulating light phenomena like reflection and refraction.

What sets Radiant Foam apart is its ability to perform without reliance on specialized hardware or APIs, needing only a standard programmable GPU. This makes it accessible and versatile, promising real-time ray tracing outcomes that don't sacrifice speed for visual fidelity. The method also gracefully bypasses the optimization challenges of discrete meshes, thanks to the continuous nature of Voronoi cell boundaries.

In a nutshell, Radiant Foam achieves what seemed elusive: bringing together the speed of rasterization with the precision of ray tracing in one comprehensive, real-time differentiable model. By doing so, it paves the way for more dynamic and flexible computer vision applications that offer high-quality renderings without breaking the computational bank.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Radiant Foam Research:**

### How I use LLMs as a staff engineer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) | 234 points | by [gfysfm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gfysfm) | [180 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409)

The debate around the utility of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering is hotter than ever. Some engineers hail these AI tools as revolutionary, while others dismiss them as hyped-up distractions. But according to a staff engineer's insights, the real key might be using these models correctly. He shares his experiences on how LLMs, particularly GitHub Copilot, have transformed his workflow.

For writing production code, Copilot serves as a powerful autocomplete tool, filling in boilerplate code and occasionally assisting in unfamiliar areas, like Golang or C. Though it's risky to rely heavily on AI in less-familiar domains without expert review, it boosts efficiency significantly for tactical changes.

When it comes to throwaway code, the engineer liberally uses LLMs. For non-production research tasks, AI speeds up processes like data classification and pattern recognition, halving the time needed.

LLMs also shine as on-demand tutors for learning new areas. By engaging in interactive dialogue, the engineer has leveraged them to grasp new domains, like Unity, quickly and effectively.

For bug fixes, while LLMs aren't perfect, sometimes they spot overlooked issues, offering a potential solution with minimal effort. However, they aren't surpassing human bug-hunting skills just yet.

In terms of drafting written documents such as ADRs and technical summaries, LLMs are used for proofreading rather than writing. They effectively catch typos and suggest insightful edits, although their style advice is often set aside.

In summary, he uses LLMs for:
- Smart autocomplete and initial drafts for less-familiar languages
- Rapid development of disposable research scripts
- Learning new technologies through Q&A
- Occasional debugging checks
- Proofreading for typos in technical writing

But he refrains from letting AI handle:
- Complete pull requests in domains he's confident in
- Writing formal documents or conducting extensive codebase research

With proper use, LLMs can still be a valuable tool in a software engineer's kit, offering enhanced productivity and new learning opportunities.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reveals polarized views on LLMs' role in software engineering:
- **Supportive Views:**  
  Some developers (e.g., smnw) argue LLMs boost productivity in drafting code, learning new skills, and debugging when used responsibly. Corporate push for AI adoption is seen as aligning with efficiency goals.  

- **Critiques and Concerns:**  
  Others (e.g., tprrls) warn that over-reliance on LLMs risks degraded code quality, non-deterministic outputs, and eroded craftsmanship. Skeptics highlight executives’ misguided focus on AI as a cost-saving trend rather than understanding its limitations.  

- **Job Market and Skill Impact:**  
  Debates emerge about LLMs commoditizing coding skills, potentially saturating the job market (nyarlathotep_) or leading to demands for 10x productivity (Jevons Paradox, per kk). Codr7 and dasil003 stress that deep system design and business logic remain human-exclusive challenges.  

- **Corporate Dynamics:**  
  Criticisms target executives’ short-term AI investments (Yoric) and pressure on developers to adopt tools without clear ROI (gbx). Fear of job displacement persists, though rebuttals note LLMs complement, not replace, skilled engineers.  

- **Technical Limitations:**  
  While LLMs aid boilerplate, their inability to grasp context (th0ma5) or ensure reliability (tkyy) underscores the need for human oversight.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The thread reflects tension between LLMs as productivity enhancers and existential threats, emphasizing responsible integration over blind adoption.

The discussion revolves around the feasibility and challenges of worker cooperatives compared to traditional shareholder-driven corporations. Here's a summary of key points:

1. **Cooperatives vs. Traditional Corporations**:  
   Critics argue cooperatives struggle to scale or succeed broadly due to legal and financial frameworks favoring conventional corporations. Traditional corporations prioritize shareholder returns and growth, while cooperatives often emphasize worker benefits and stability, which can limit their competitiveness. Examples like Spain’s **Mondragon Corporation** (70,000 employees) and smaller cooperatives like **King Arthur Baking Company** show cooperatives *can* thrive, but they remain niche. Challenges include funding (relying on member contributions or government support instead of private investors) and slower growth due to prioritizing worker welfare over expansion.

2. **Incentives and Growth**:  
   Supporters highlight cooperatives’ focus on worker satisfaction and long-term stability over relentless growth. Skeptics counter that growth is essential for market survival, especially in competitive industries. Traditional corporations face pressure to maximize profits for investors, whereas cooperatives reinvest earnings into employee benefits, sometimes at the expense of scalability.

3. **Structural and Cultural Barriers**:  
   Participants note that cooperatives often face legal systems and financial markets designed for investor-driven models. In countries like France, cooperatives benefit from labor laws but still struggle with high non-wage costs compared to conventional firms. Some suggest hybrid models or government-backed funding mechanisms to address these gaps.

4. **Defining Business Success**:  
   A recurring debate centers on redefining success beyond growth metrics. Critics of traditional capitalism argue businesses should prioritize equitable treatment of workers, sustainable practices, and fulfilling commitments to stakeholders. Others assert that profitability and market competitiveness remain unavoidable realities, even for cooperatives.

**Examples & Counterpoints**:  
- Mondragon’s success contrasts with the rarity of large cooperatives in the U.S., attributed to cultural and systemic biases.  
- Some users question whether non-growth-focused models can survive in hyper-competitive markets (e.g., restaurants).  

The discussion underscores tensions between idealism (worker empowerment, equitable structures) and pragmatism (growth, investor demands) in organizational design.

### Google Lifts a Ban on Using Its AI for Weapons and Surveillance

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-responsible-ai-principles/) | 16 points | by [vinnyglennon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vinnyglennon) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42940685)

In a surprising twist, Google is revamping its principles on the use of artificial intelligence, stepping back from earlier commitments not to engage in technologies with potential for harm, like weapons or invasive surveillance. This change has sparked concern among employees and observers, as it replaces strict prohibitions with broader guidelines allowing for more flexibility under the guise of human oversight and alignment with human rights norms.

Back in 2018, amid backlash over a military contract, Google set guidelines to avoid developing tech for warfare or rights violations. However, the updated policy seems to retract those bans and instead emphasizes collaborative and responsible AI development based on democratic values like freedom and equality, as highlighted by executives like James Manyika and Demis Hassabis.

This shift occurs amidst a backdrop of evolving global AI standards and geopolitical tension. Critics, like Parul Koul of the Alphabet Union, express alarm over Google's course change without wider input, wary of the company's potential involvement in military-focused projects.

Adding to the controversy, Google’s AI teams once dedicated to ensuring ethical adherence in projects have faced restructures and operational challenges, leading some former members to question the genuine commitment to these guiding principles.

Despite the overhaul, Google maintains policies against harmful use on its Cloud Platform, though its application remains contested, such as in deals like Project Nimbus with the Israeli government. The move underscores an apparent shift towards prioritizing strategic and business needs over the previously advertised "Do No Harm" philosophy.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
A user ("dmg") expresses internal conflict over Google’s reported policy shift, noting that while they once admired Google’s initial intent to avoid harmful uses of AI (e.g., weapons), they now criticize the company for prioritizing strategic or financial interests (“carry big stock”) under the guise of maintaining public relations or peace (“mntn pc”). Replies focus on the “stck” (stock) reference, possibly interpreting it as a critique of Google’s profit-driven motives or powerful influence ("big stick"). The exchange reflects broader skepticism about Google balancing ethics with business priorities, aligning with concerns raised in the original submission.
