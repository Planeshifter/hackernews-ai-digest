#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02258) | 262 points | by [milliondreams](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=milliondreams) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39960717)

The latest submission on arXiv discusses a cutting-edge approach to transformer-based language models in a paper titled "Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models". The authors, including David Raposo and five others, propose a method where transformers can learn to allocate compute dynamically to specific positions in a sequence rather than spreading FLOPs uniformly. By capping the number of tokens that participate in computations at each layer and using a top-k routing mechanism, the models can optimize compute allocation along the sequence for different layers. This dynamic approach allows for efficient compute expenditure while maintaining baseline performance, making the models faster and more effective.

The discussion on the latest submission about dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models covered various aspects such as the comparison between Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Recursive NNs, the distinction between specific models, the challenges with training models, the analogy of network processing to human brain functions, the attention mechanism, the improvements in dynamic routing mechanisms, the understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), the implications of recurrent structures, the potential of Universal Transformers, and the application of modern techniques to enhance model efficiency. Furthermore, it delved into the complexity of model design, the significance of token context windows, and the evolution of transformer architectures. Participants highlighted the need for clear explanations and provided resources for further exploration of related concepts.

### Meta will label AI content to help prevent deepfakes on Facebook and Instagram

#### [Submission URL](https://www.axios.com/2024/04/05/meta-broader-ai-labeling) | 10 points | by [geekthegame](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geekthegame) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39962104)

Meta, previously known as Facebook, is set to expand its labeling of AI-generated content such as videos, audio, and images by introducing "Made with AI" tags beginning in May. This move comes in response to the platform's acknowledgment that its current labeling policies are too limited to address the growing array of AI-generated and manipulated content circulating online. The decision follows concerns raised by Meta's independent Oversight Board, prompting a necessary update to their existing guidelines. While the platform aims to maintain transparency by adding labels and context to such content, it remains committed to removing any content that breaches its established policies, including those related to voter interference, bullying, violence, and incitement. This shift towards enhanced labeling reflects Meta's efforts to adapt to the evolving landscape of online content and address the challenges posed by artificial intelligence in digital media.

The discussion primarily revolves around the difficulty in reliably distinguishing between AI-generated content and human-generated content. Some users express skepticism, suggesting that AI content tends to be sensational or quirky to attract clicks, while others mention that young people are easily influenced by trending content on platforms like Instagram and TikTok, regardless of whether it is generated by AI or not. One user argues that tech-savvy individuals can generally differentiate between AI-generated and human-generated content, especially on platforms like Instagram Threads that focus on AI content and models. The overall tone in the discussion leans towards questioning the reliability and impact of AI-generated content in the online space.
