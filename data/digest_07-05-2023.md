### Cicada: Private on-chain voting using time-lock puzzles

#### [Submission URL](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/building-cicada-private-on-chain-voting-using-time-lock-puzzles/) | 38 points | by [subsequent](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=subsequent) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36607081)

A new open-source Solidity library called Cicada has been released, aimed at providing privacy for on-chain voting on platforms such as Ethereum. Cicada utilizes time-lock puzzles and zero-knowledge proofs to ensure private voting, addressing the drawbacks of current on-chain voting protocols that lack privacy. By securing the secrecy of individual ballots, vote tallies, and voter identities, Cicada aims to prevent manipulation and encourage democratic outcomes in decentralized organizations. Developers are encouraged to explore Cicada's GitHub repository and consider its potential for different voting schemes and features. The library offers running tally privacy, which can be combined with zero-knowledge group membership proofs to achieve voter anonymity and ballot privacy.

The discussion on the submission about the new open-source Solidity library, Cicada, revolves around various aspects of its privacy features and the challenges associated with on-chain voting. One user points out that the privacy aspect of on-chain voting is an interesting concept, but they find it difficult to fully understand how it would work in practice. Another user adds that while the library offers privacy, the final tally of the votes can still be deduced, albeit reasonably small.

The discussion also touches on the notion of blockchain technology and its reputation for providing security and trust. Some users express skepticism about implementing transparent, blockchain-backed voting systems, as they believe they could still be subject to conspiracy and fraud. One user shares a relevant XKCD comic that highlights the issue of misinformation and the challenges of reinventing the entire voting system. The conversation further delves into the feasibility and trustworthiness of different voting systems, with references to specific regions and their respective experiences. Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and challenges associated with implementing secure and private voting systems, while also questioning the effectiveness and trustworthiness of existing solutions.

### The many ways that digital minds can know â€“ A better way to think about LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://moultano.wordpress.com/2023/06/28/the-many-ways-that-digital-minds-can-know/) | 112 points | by [moultano](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moultano) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36603573)

LLMs, or large language models, have been the subject of intense debate among proponents and critics. However, the author of this post argues that LLMs actually fulfill the claims of both sides simultaneously. They possess both the ability to generate AGI-like output and to learn the complex functions of multivariable calculus. The author introduces new terminology to discuss these phenomena: search index size and memorization. They draw an analogy between search engine index size and LLMs' ability to "memorize" information. A larger search index allows search engines to provide more accurate results to specific queries, even for obscure topics. Similarly, LLMs can generate relevant responses by inferring meaning from queries, even if the exact wording is not present in the training data. The post explores this analogy further, highlighting the importance of both memorization and generalization in LLMs' capabilities.

The discussion surrounding the submission is varied. One user discusses the similarities between large language models (LLMs) and the concept of Relational Frame Theory (RFT), highlighting how both involve identifying and manipulating relationships and contextual understanding. Another user disagrees, stating that LLMs do not truly understand text but instead analyze and reproduce statistical patterns. The conversation shifts to the understanding and interpretation capabilities of LLMs compared to humans, with one user highlighting their conversations with ChatGPT and suggesting that it has some level of understanding, albeit different from humans. There are also discussions about cognitive context, the limitations of LLMs, and the role of numerical computation in LLMs. Another user comments on the power and limitations of LLMs, while others question the balance of views and parameters in LLMs and the concept of digital minds.

### ChatGPT's explosive growth shows first decline in traffic since launch

#### [Submission URL](https://www.reuters.com/technology/booming-traffic-openais-chatgpt-posts-first-ever-monthly-dip-june-similarweb-2023-07-05/) | 24 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36606754)

OpenAI's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, experienced a decline in monthly traffic and unique visitors in June, marking the first time this has occurred since its launch in November 2022. According to analytics firm Similarweb, desktop and mobile traffic to the ChatGPT website dropped by 9.7%, while unique visitors decreased by 5.7%. The amount of time spent on the website also saw an 8.5% decline. Similarweb's Senior Insights Manager David Carr attributes the decreasing traffic to the novelty of the chatbot wearing off, while RBC Capital Markets analyst Rishi Jaluria suggests a greater demand for generative AI with real-time information. Despite the drop in website traffic, ChatGPT remains the fastest-growing consumer application ever and currently boasts over 1.5 billion monthly visits, placing it among the top 20 websites globally. OpenAI has not yet commented on the recent decline in traffic.
