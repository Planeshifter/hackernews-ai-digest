#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02495) | 145 points | by [tim_sw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tim_sw) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578430)

In a recent submission to arXiv, a team of researchers led by Zijun Liu delves into the cutting-edge domain of enhancing reinforcement learning (RL) through a method they call "Inference-Time Scaling for Generalist Reward Modeling." As large language models (LLMs) gain traction in various applications, optimizing their reward mechanisms becomes crucial, especially for complex, real-world queries beyond simpler, rule-based ones. The team's work explores how to scale such reward models effectively during inference, rather than the traditional training phase.

Their approach, pointwise generative reward modeling (GRM), is touted for its adaptability across diverse input types, paving the way for more nuanced computational demands at inference time. They introduce Self-Principled Critique Tuning (SPCT), a novel method that refines the reward generation process by enabling adaptability and accuracy in critique, honing the DeepSeek-GRM models they propose.

This ambitious development pushes the envelope in how these models are trained and evaluated, utilizing parallel sampling to maximize computational resources and integrating a meta reward model to refine decision processes. The preliminary findings suggest a marked improvement over existing models, promising less bias and more robust performance metrics.

While the authors acknowledge challenges remain, particularly in certain task arenas, the open-sourcing of their models invites further development and collaboration within the community. As this work undergoes peer review, it sets the stage for a potentially transformative advance in the field of machine learning and AI.

### AI bots strain Wikimedia as bandwidth surges 50%

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/04/ai-bots-strain-wikimedia-as-bandwidth-surges-50/) | 44 points | by [pabs3](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pabs3) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43578476)

On Tuesday, the Wikimedia Foundation highlighted a significant challenge it's facing—the relentless scraping of data by AI bots is straining Wikipedia's servers. As AI companies seek vast amounts of data for their models, they've increased automated scraping of sites like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, significantly boosting bandwidth use for multimedia downloads by 50% since early 2024.

This surge in bot traffic, which largely involves crawling lesser-known pages unvisited by human users, is placing an immense burden on Wikimedia's infrastructure. An illustrative moment occurred when Jimmy Carter's Wikipedia page and a related video saw a massive spike in traffic following his death, revealing how bot activity had already stretched Wikimedia's network capacity.

Many of these AI bots flout traditional web standards, like robots.txt, and employ tactics to mimic human users, complicating efforts by Wikimedia's Site Reliability team to manage this issue. This is a broader phenomenon affecting the free and open-source software (FOSS) community, as seen with other platforms facing similar challenges.

In response, Wikimedia is focusing on systemic solutions to advocate for responsible infrastructure use, aiming for collaboration with AI developers to find sustainable ways to support the open knowledge ecosystem without sacrificing infrastructure stability. Without such efforts, the very platforms that have fueled AI advancements may struggle to sustain themselves. Wikimedia's message is poignant: open content access must be balanced with the resources required to sustain it.

The Hacker News discussion about Wikimedia's struggle with AI bot scraping revolves around several key themes:  

### 1. **Criticism of AI Companies**  
   - Users criticize AI developers for scraping aggressively, ignoring standards like `robots.txt`, and straining Wikimedia’s servers. Some argue that large AI providers (e.g., "the big 5") prioritize speed over efficiency, leading to wasteful resource use and technical incompetence.  
   - **Example**: One user notes that AI companies often scrape obscure, rarely visited pages instead of using Wikipedia’s freely available databases or torrents, which would reduce server load.  

### 2. **Debate Over LLM Utility vs. Cost**  
   - While some defend LLMs for practical tasks (e.g., summarizing text, answering questions, generating charts from CSV data), others question the ethics and efficiency of using LLMs for trivial or resource-heavy purposes (e.g., passive-aggressive landlord emails).  
   - A recurring point: LLMs often fetch content inefficiently, leading to redundant server requests that human users would never generate.  

### 3. **Infrastructure Strain and Solutions**  
   - Users suggest systemic fixes, such as better caching of frequently accessed URLs or direct database downloads instead of web scraping. Some propose that AI providers should collaborate with Wikimedia to optimize data access.  
   - Skepticism arises about whether AI companies will adopt these solutions, given their focus on rapid data acquisition.  

### 4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about a "dark age" of information if platforms like Wikipedia collapse under AI-driven traffic.  
   - A meta-discussion critiques the irony of AI models relying on open-source knowledge while undermining the infrastructure that sustains it.  

### 5. **Tone and Sentiment**  
   - Frustration dominates, with users accusing AI firms of hypocrisy (profiting from free content while harming its sustainability). Others inject dark humor, like welcoming a "dark age" if Wikipedia fails.  

In summary, the thread reflects tension between AI innovation and ethical/responsible infrastructure use, with calls for collaboration to preserve open knowledge ecosystems.
