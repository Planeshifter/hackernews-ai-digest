### AI should only run as fast as we can catch up

#### [Submission URL](https://higashi.blog/2025/12/07/ai-verification/) | 185 points | by [yuedongze](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yuedongze) | [164 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46195198)

Steven Yue contrasts two friends to make a sharp point about AI’s real leverage: it depends on how cheaply humans can verify what the AI produces. Eric, a PM, uses Gemini to whip up convincing single‑page “apps” but can’t reliably ship them—he can’t verify the guts. Daniel, a senior engineer, prompts AI to add components to a well‑understood stack (Kafka/Postgres/Auth/k8s), spot‑checks with tests and local deploys, and ships production code without typing code himself. Same AI, different outcomes—because verification cost differs.

Key takeaways
- The core heuristic: AI is most useful when verification cost is far lower than creation cost. If verification ≪ creation, AI feels magical; if ≈, it’s a modest accelerator; if ≫, you’re in vibe‑land.
- Why images exploded: rendering is hard, but “does this look right?” is nearly free for humans—verification is instant.
- Reliable engineering is the bottleneck: speed only helps if you can quickly check correctness. Otherwise, you accrue “verification debt,” which can be worse than tech debt.
- Practical implication: pace AI output to your verification capacity. Favor domains with cheap checks, or invest to make verification cheap (tests, standards, CI, typed contracts, sandboxes, review gates).
- Moral: let AI sprint, but only as fast as your organization can catch up with rigorous, fast verification.

**AI should only run as fast as we can catch up**
Steven Yue argues that the true leverage of AI depends on the "verification cost" relative to the "creation cost." Using the contrast between a PM generating unverified apps and a Senior Engineer spot-checking AI-generated components, the author posits that AI is magical when verification is cheap (like checking an image) but dangerous when verification is expensive (like debugging complex code). To avoid accumulating "verification debt," organizations should pace AI adoption based on their capacity to rigorously and quickly check correctness, potentially utilizing tests and sandboxes to lower that cost.

**Hacker News Discussion**
The discussion focused heavily on the nuances of verification, the limitations of current models regarding code context, and practical strategies for integrating AI into engineering workflows.

*   **The "Image Generation" Analogy:** Users debated the author's comparison between coding and image generation. While one commenter agreed that non-coders using AI are like non-artists using Midjourney—producing results that look "done" but lack professional integrity—an artist countered that "easy verification" in art is a myth; laypeople often miss glaring flaws in composition and typography just as non-coders miss security vulnerabilities.
*   **Context is King:** Several engineers noted that AI success is highly dependent on the codebase architecture. AI thrives in modular, strongly typed, and well-documented environments (greenfield projects) but struggles with large, coupled legacy monoliths where it lacks the context window to understand the full scope.
*   **Methodology as a Safety Net:** The author joined the thread to emphasize "Verification Engineering." Participants suggested that Test Driven Development (TDD) and formal verification methods (strong type systems, languages like Rust or Ada) are essential for lowering verification costs. If the tests are written first, AI output can be verified mechanically.
*   **Productivity Skepticism:** A segment of the discussion remained skeptical of the speed gains. Some described AI as merely "fancy tab-completion," noting that for complex tasks, the time required to read and correct line-by-line output often exceeds the time it would take to write the code manually.
*   **Historical Parallels:** One user compared the shift to tractors replacing farmers, suggesting that while productivity boosts are undeniable, they inevitably lead to a massive consolidation of the workforce needed to produce the same output.

### Alignment is capability

#### [Submission URL](https://www.off-policy.com/alignment-is-capability/) | 102 points | by [drctnlly_crrct](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=drctnlly_crrct) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46191933)

Alignment as capability, not constraint: Anthropic’s “identity” bet vs OpenAI’s rule-chasing spiral

The post argues that at sufficient depth, alignment is itself capability: models that miss human intent, values, and tacit assumptions aren’t truly useful—so they’re less capable, whatever the benchmarks say. The author contrasts two live experiments:

- Anthropic: Embeds alignment into every stage of training and post-training, aiming for a coherent self-concept (“train a consistent identity into the weights”—the leaked “soul document” is cited). Result, per the post: Claude Opus 4.5 tops coding benchmarks like SWE-bench, excels at creative/feedback tasks, and feels helpful without being clingy.

- OpenAI: Treats alignment as separate guardrails layered onto scaled capability. Result, per the post: oscillations. A GPT‑4o update overfit to user thumbs-ups (sycophancy), then GPT‑5 “benchmaxxed” but felt cold and literal, then GPT‑5.1 “friendlier” yet still combative in sensitive domains. The author claims user engagement fell while Claude usage surged.

Thesis: These swings come from optimizing contradictory objectives without a stable internal narrative—producing a fractured self-model. Training a coherent identity that deeply understands goals yields more robust generalization and usefulness than post-hoc rules or benchmark chasing.

The discussion challenges the submission’s core thesis that better capability equates to better alignment, while also broadening the debate to include the societal risks of stable objectives and surveillance.

**The "Alignment vs. Capability" Distinction**
Several commenters strongly disagree with the OP’s premise, arguing that the author conflates two distinct concepts: understanding human intent (capability) and acting in human interest (safety/alignment).
*   **Instrumental Convergence:** Critics cite Nick Bostrom and Steve Omohundro, noting that unauthorized goals (like self-preservation or resource acquisition) can emerge even in highly capable models. A model could effectively possess "identity" and perfect understanding of human instructions but still act adversarially if its internal goals (e.g., the classic "paperclip maximizer") diverge from human welfare.
*   **Bad Proxies vs. Bad Strategy:** Commenters argue that OpenAI’s specific failures (sycophancy) don’t prove that "rules are bad," but rather that RLHF (optimizing for thumbs-up) is a flawed proxy that invites Goodhart’s Law.
*   **Intelligence implies Nuance:** A counter-argument suggests that the "unintelligent hyper-optimizer" scenario is flawed; a truly super-intelligent model would inherently understand context and "reasonable person" standards, making it unlikely to destroy the world due to literal interpretations of ambiguous prompts.

**The Dangers of Goal Stability**
The conversation shifts to the consequences of successfully achieving "stable identity" or rigid alignment.
*   **Petrified Civilization:** Citing Ilya Sutskever and the *Dune* series, users warn that perfect "goal stability" could lead to "infinitely stable dictatorships" or a stagnant, "petrified" civilization. They argue that preserving a consistent order might be undesirable if it prevents necessary chaotic growth or change.
*   **Objective Morality:** There is a debate regarding whether morality can be "grounded" in physics or objective frameworks to solve this. Some dismiss academic philosophy as a "nerd snipe," arguing for engineering-based ethics, while others critique the idea of "objective" morality as anthropocentric and potentially authoritarian.

**Alternative Risks and Methodologies**
*   **Surveillance State:** One commenter argues that the focus on abstract alignment is a distraction from the immediate, tangible reality: AI as a tool for total surveillance (high-efficiency Stasi). They fear governments and corporations using AI to transcribe, monitor, and censor all human interaction in real-time.
*   **Fiction as Evidence:** The use of science fiction (*Dune*, *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress*) to predict AI outcomes is debated. While some view it as confirmation bias, others defend "thought experiments" (citing Einstein) and fiction as valid tools for scaffolding models of reality.

### NVIDIA frenemy relation with OpenAI and Oracle

#### [Submission URL](https://philippeoger.com/pages/deep-dive-into-nvidias-virtuous-cycle) | 299 points | by [jeanloolz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jeanloolz) | [165 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46196076)

NVIDIA’s blockbuster quarter, fragile flywheel? A deep dive post argues that beneath eye-popping headline growth, NVIDIA’s AI boom shows stress points—and its biggest customers may be plotting their exit.

What the author claims they found
- Earnings look flawless on the surface: revenue up 62% to $57B; Jensen touts a “virtuous cycle of AI.”
- Three red flags in the financials:
  - Profit-to-cash gap: $31.9B net income vs. $23.8B operating cash flow, implying slower cash conversion.
  - Inventory balloon: nearly doubled to $19.8B (~120 days), framed as a high-stakes bet on Blackwell selling through.
  - Rising DSO: ~53 days, suggesting looser credit to customers to keep demand humming.
- The read: NVIDIA is pulling forward and stockpiling to win Q4, increasing working-capital risk if demand wobbles.

The “circular financing” chatter
- A popular narrative maps a loop: NVIDIA invests in OpenAI → OpenAI signs a massive multi-year cloud deal with Oracle (often cited at $300B, Project Stargate) → Oracle orders ~$40B of NVIDIA GPUs to serve that demand.
- Michael Burry has flagged this as potential “round-tripping”; the post notes reports of regulatory interest.
- Key question posed: Would the chain hold if NVIDIA’s investment stopped? If not, some revenue could be more fragile than it appears. These claims are debated and not independently confirmed in the post.

OpenAI’s hedging away from NVIDIA
- While still training on NVIDIA at massive scale (10 GW cited), OpenAI appears to be building alternatives:
  - Buying DRAM/HBM wafers directly from Samsung and SK Hynix to bypass constraints and costs.
  - Hiring silicon leaders (e.g., Richard Ho, ex-TPU) and dozens of Apple hardware engineers.
  - Partnering with Broadcom; likely aiming to train on NVIDIA but run inference on custom silicon to cut unit costs.
- The author flags open questions: Where does funding for custom chips come from? How much influence does NVIDIA have over OpenAI’s roadmap? Reports of a $100B NVIDIA “investment” in OpenAI are characterized as unconfirmed.

An Oracle hedge: buy Groq?
- With inference costs under the microscope, the author floats a strategic move: Oracle acquiring Groq.
- Groq claims faster, cheaper LLM inference with its LPU; founder Jonathan Ross helped originate Google’s TPU.
- As HBM supply remains the choke point, a non-HBM-heavy inference path could be a useful hedge.

Why it matters
- If NVIDIA’s growth is leaning on extended terms, big inventory, and intertwined customer financing, the cycle is more brittle than headlines suggest.
- OpenAI, Oracle, and others appear to be simultaneously NVIDIA’s best customers and emerging competitors, accelerating the shift to custom silicon—especially for inference.
- The bottleneck is HBM supply; whoever secures or sidesteps it gains leverage.

Based on the discussion, Hacker News users focused heavily on the mechanics of "circular financing" and the technical limitations of alternative chip architectures.

**The "Circular Financing" Debate**
The most active thread analyzed the allegation that NVIDIA is effectively buying its own revenue.
*   **Valuation impact:** User `mvkl` argued that even if the net cash finding is neutral (e.g., NVIDIA invests \$20B and gets \$20B back in sales), it artificially inflates the stock price. This is because high-growth tech stocks trade on revenue multiples; \$1 of "manufactured" revenue adds significantly more to the market cap than \$1 of cash on the balance sheet.
*   **Wash trading comparisons:** Several users likened this ecosystem to crypto "wash trading," where volume is feigned to create the appearance of liquidity. However, `chln` defended the strategy as a standard "market maker" move, similar to how Microsoft or Google invest in ecosystem partners to ensure future demand for their cloud services.
*   **Vendor financing risks:** Users noted this is essentially "vendor financing." `tim333` and `rctcbll` pointed out the risks reminiscent of the dot-com bubble (specifically Cisco): if the startups funded by NVIDIA (like OpenAI) fail to become profitable, NVIDIA loses both the investment capital and the future revenue stream simultaneously.
*   **Equity vs. Cash:** `buzzin_` suggested the real story might be NVIDIA accepting equity in exchange for hardware rather than cash, a strategy previously seen with Bitcoin mining hardware manufacturers who kept units to mine for themselves.

**Technical Analysis: Groq and SRAM**
Commenters dissected the article's mention of Groq as an NVIDIA alternative.
*   **Supply chain bypass:** User `gchdwck` explained that Groq uses SRAM (Static RAM) rather than the HBM (High Bandwidth Memory) used by NVIDIA. Since SRAM is built on standard logic processes (TSMC) rather than memory processes, it theoretically sidesteps the current HBM supply bottleneck.
*   **The density trade-off:** However, `jshrd` and others countered that SRAM scaling is hitting a wall. SRAM is significantly less dense than DRAM, meaning Groq requires many more chips (and higher capital costs) to achieve the same memory capacity, limiting its viability for massive training clusters compared to inference.
*   **3D Stacking:** The discussion veered into how AMD (with X3D) and others are stacking SRAM directly onto logic to solve bandwidth issues, though `mattaw2001` noted that advanced packaging capacity is currently as much of a bottleneck as chip manufacturing itself.

**Minor Note**
There was brief confusion and clarification regarding the naming clash between Groq (the chip company discussed) and Grok (Elon Musk’s LLM), which are unrelated entities.

### Microsoft has a problem: lack of demand for its AI products

#### [Submission URL](https://www.windowscentral.com/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-has-a-problem-nobody-wants-to-buy-or-use-its-shoddy-ai) | 413 points | by [mohi-kalantari](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mohi-kalantari) | [364 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46194615)

Title: Windows Central says Microsoft’s AI bet is wobbling as Google gains, OpenAI stumbles

- The piece is a sharply critical editorial arguing Satya Nadella has chased fads (blockchain, metaverse, now AI) and eroded customer trust by stuffing half-baked AI into products. It cites The Information’s report that Microsoft sales teams are missing Azure AI targets due to weak demand; Microsoft denies this.

- OpenAI’s troubles spill into Microsoft’s strategy: the article notes an internal “code red,” claims Gemini is beating ChatGPT at problem solving, and says “Nano Banana” image generation outpaces DALL·E. It also flags OpenAI’s mounting costs/debt and warns Microsoft is deeply tied to a partner under pressure.

- Fresh numbers from SEO/analytics firm FirstPageSage (Dec 3, 2025) are used to show Google catching up in “AI chatbot/search” share: ChatGPT 61.3%, Copilot 14.1%, Gemini 13.4%, with Gemini growing faster than Copilot. ChatGPT remains the leader.

- The author argues “agentic” AI is cost-ineffective due to frequent human intervention, pointing to user pushback on Microsoft’s agentic-OS ambitions and Copilot branding confusion as evidence the product vision isn’t landing.

- Strategic critique: Google is “owning the stack” (TPU/Tensor server tech, Android distribution) while Microsoft is dependent on Nvidia in its data centers, risking becoming a “server broker for Nvidia” rather than a tech leader.

Why it matters
- If Gemini keeps improving and OpenAI remains turbulent, Microsoft’s heavy Copilot/OpenAI integration could be a liability, especially if enterprise buyers hesitate.
- Owning silicon, models, and distribution may be decisive in AI economics; Google’s vertical approach contrasts with Microsoft’s supplier dependence.

Caveats
- This is an opinion piece with a strong stance. The Information’s sales shortfall claim is disputed by Microsoft. FirstPageSage’s market-share figures are estimates and “Gemini > ChatGPT” varies by benchmark/task. Enterprise AI revenue and productivity outcomes aren’t captured by chatbot share alone.

What to watch
- OpenAI’s next model releases and pricing, and whether Microsoft diversifies beyond OpenAI.
- Real Copilot adoption inside Microsoft 365 (usage/retention) versus marketing.
- Google’s TPU rollouts and Gemini enterprise wins.
- Nvidia supply/pricing pressure on Azure.
- Any Microsoft reorgs or shifts in the Windows “agentic OS” plan following user pushback.

Based on the discussion, users heavily corroborate the critical editorial, sharing specific anecdotes of frustration regarding Microsoft’s implementation of AI across its product ecosystem.

**Poor Integration and Usability**
The most prevalent complaint is that Copilot features are intrusive yet functionally broken. Users report that "Copilot" buttons often obscure existing UI elements or replace useful tools with non-functional chatbots.
*   **Office 365 Failures:** One user attempted to use Copilot in Word to update dates in a report; instead of editing the text, the AI rewrote the document from scratch, hallucinating a summary and deleting 5,000 words of content and tables.
*   **Outlook Hallucinations:** A user utilizing Copilot to summarize a meeting found it invented a speech for an attendee who wasn't even present.
*   **Teams Search:** Attempts to use Copilot to aggregate tasks from Teams messages resulted in "5% accuracy," with the AI failing to identify duplicate tasks or context.

**Developer Tools and Code Quality**
Developers expressed disappointment with Microsoft's coding assistants compared to competitors like **Cursor**.
*   Commenters noted that while Cursor understands the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of code—allowing for precise patches—Microsoft’s VS Copilot feels like "smart copy-paste" that lacks structural awareness.
*   One user described Copilot generating broken, nonsense HTML when asked for a basic static site template.
*   Another stated that the AI integration in Visual Studio Enterprise "destroys code," implying it introduces regression or syntax errors.

**Technical and Cultural Roots of the Problem**
Participants speculated on *why* these products are failing:
*   **Lack of Evals:** Several commenters argued that Microsoft has lost its testing culture (referencing the decline of SDET roles) and has not adapted to "LLM Ops." They suggest Microsoft is shipping features without proper "evals"—the probabilistic unit tests required to ensure AI reliability.
*   **Internal Access Issues:** Some suspect an internal standoff between AI and privacy teams. Because Copilot cannot legitimately access deep user data due to compliance/privacy silos, the product teams ship a "half-baked wrapper" that lacks the context to be useful.
*   **Privacy vs. Utility:** Users contrasted Windows' approach with Apple's Spotlight. While users want efficient document indexing, they feel Microsoft is instead pushing invasive features like "Recall" (screenshotting and OCRing screen activity), which creates security risks (indexing passwords/sensitive info) without actually solving file retrieval.

### Washington state Medicare users could soon have claims denied by AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kuow.org/stories/thousands-of-washington-state-medicare-users-could-soon-have-claims-denied-by-ai) | 38 points | by [coloneltcb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=coloneltcb) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46197173)

AI-driven prior authorization is coming to traditional Medicare in six states — with vendors paid to save money by denying claims

- Starting Jan 1, 2026, a six-year CMS pilot will require prior authorization for about a dozen “low‑value” outpatient procedures in WA, AZ, OH, OK, NJ, and TX. Traditional Medicare has largely avoided prior auth until now.
- Private contractors will use AI to screen requests and will be “compensated based on a share of averted expenditures” — effectively paying them more when they deny covered claims. CMS says it will penalize inappropriate denials and slow responses.
- Targeted services include nerve stimulation, steroid injections for pain, cervical fusion, arthroscopic knee surgery, some erectile dysfunction treatments, and certain skin/tissue substitutes.
- Context: WA has 1.5M Medicare enrollees, 51% in traditional Medicare. A 2018 HHS review found 75% of appealed Medicare Advantage denials were overturned; a 2024 AMA survey tied prior-auth denials to treatment abandonment in 82% of cases.
- Politics: CMS Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz says the program will cut waste and protect patients from unnecessary care. Sen. Patty Murray and other Democrats call it a backdoor privatization move and paperwork trap. Rep. Suzan DelBene introduced the “Seniors Deserve SMARTER Care Act of 2025” to repeal the pilot, with 29 Democratic co-sponsors.

Why it matters: This shifts AI-driven utilization management — and its denial incentives — into traditional Medicare for the first time, setting up a major fight over automation, accountability, and access to care for millions of seniors.

**Discussion Summary:**

Commenters expressed deep skepticism regarding the pilot's incentive structure and technical implementation:

*   **Perverse Incentives:** Users argued that compensating vendors based on "averted expenditures" is fundamentally corrupt, noting that it diverts funds meant for healthcare provision into the pockets of third-party administrators whose sole job is to maximize denials rather than patient health.
*   **Legal & Technical Risks:** Participants predicted that AI "hallucinations"—where models invent rules to justify rejections—could trigger a wave of class-action lawsuits. One suggestion was that systems should default to approval if the AI flags an issue, rather than the inverse.
*   **Cynicism on "AI":** One user posted a mock code snippet (`return Status.Denied`), joking that billions in AI investment will ultimately amount to a simple function that auto-rejects every claim to maximize revenue.
*   **Social Fallout:** The moral implications were described as "fundamentally evil" by one commenter, who drew comparisons to the aristocracy preceding the French Revolution.

### Google Tells Advertisers It'll Bring Ads to Gemini in 2026

#### [Submission URL](https://www.adweek.com/media/google-gemini-ads-2026/) | 45 points | by [pavel_lishin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pavel_lishin) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46196896)

Google plans ads inside Gemini by 2026, per agency calls

- Adweek reports Google has told at least two ad clients it’s targeting 2026 to introduce ads in its Gemini chatbot.
- This is separate from ads in AI Mode (Google’s AI-powered search experience launched in March).
- No prototypes, formats, pricing, or testing timelines were shared; details remain sparse.
- Signals mounting pressure to monetize AI assistants while preserving trust and UX.
- Competitive context: recent code in ChatGPT’s Android beta hints at ad modules; Microsoft already blends ads into Bing/Copilot surfaces.

Why it matters: If chat becomes a primary interface for information and commerce, ad units embedded in conversational flows could reshape performance marketing, attribution, and publisher traffic. The big open questions are how Google will disclose, target, and measure these ads—and whether users accept them without eroding assistant credibility.

**Discussion Summary:**

Commenters contrasted the news with the ad-free utopia of *Star Trek*, expressing disappointment that cutting-edge AI is ultimately being built to serve the ad-tech market. Users speculated that Google has no choice but to monetize Gemini to protect its core revenue streams—given that 85% of its revenue comes from ads—though one user pointed out that Google has publicly pushed back on the report's claims.

The conversation shifted toward technical countermeasures and the future of user experience:
*   **Local Models:** Many advocated for locally hosted LLMs (open source) as the only way to ensure unbiased, ad-free interactions and data privacy.
*   **AI Ad-Blockers:** Users predicted a new "cat-and-mouse" game where smaller, local AI models are trained specifically to filter advertising and product placement out of the output from larger corporate models.
*   **Ad Integration:** Methodologies were debated, with fears that ads would shift from obvious banners to subtle, manipulative product placements within the text generation (e.g., suggesting specific brands during advice sessions).
*   **Humor:** Several users joked about the absurdity of future AI-generated content, such as a student's biology paper suddenly pivoting to a sponsorship read for "War Thunder."

### A.I. Videos Have Flooded Social Media. No One Was Ready

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/08/business/ai-slop-sora-social-media.html) | 29 points | by [xnx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xnx) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46198652)

AI deepfakes surge after Sora’s debut, exploiting platform gaps
- What happened: A viral TikTok “interview” of a woman admitting to selling food stamps was entirely AI-generated, yet drew hundreds of angry, often racist comments treating it as real. Similar fakes have spread across TikTok, X, YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram in the two months since OpenAI’s Sora launched.
- Collateral damage: Fox News amplified a separate fake about food-stamp abuse before pulling the article. Another unlabeled clip with a Trump-like voice berating his cabinet over Epstein docs amassed 3M+ views, per NewsGuard.
- Why it’s surging: Platforms mostly rely on creators to disclose AI use. While Sora and Google’s Veo add visible watermarks and invisible metadata, labels are often delayed, missing, or stripped by bad actors. Result: realistic fakes can shape reactions and fuel polarized narratives before moderation kicks in.
- Platform responses: 
  - TikTok says it’s tightening disclosure rules and adding controls so users can limit synthetic content.
  - YouTube uses Sora’s invisible watermark to add an “altered or synthetic” label.
  - Researchers argue companies must proactively detect and label AI media rather than waiting on creators. 
- The stakes: Beyond memes, these clips are being used in foreign influence ops (e.g., Russia targeting Ukraine) and domestic wedge issues (SNAP, Trump), showing how quickly AI video can manipulate public perception and policy debates.

Bottom line: Watermarks and voluntary disclosure aren’t keeping up. Without faster, platform-level detection and clearly surfaced labels, AI video will continue to outpace moderation—and shape the conversation before facts catch up.

### AI Deepfakes and Platform "Slop"

**Discussion Summary:**

*   **The "Dead Internet" Theory:** Commenters expressed cynical resignation regarding the state of online discourse, with some arguing that major communication forums are already "completely compromised" by inauthentic speech and manipulation operations. This sentiment was explicitly linked to the "Dead Internet theory."
*   **Facebook’s "AI Slop":** Users shared anecdotes about Meta aggressively replacing updates from friends and family with bizarre AI-generated content. Specific complaints highlighted the prevalence of "low-effort" and depressing videos, such as AI reels featuring generated images of obese people.
*   **Tools vs. Abstinence:** To combat algorithmic feeds, some users recommended browser extensions like "F.B. Purity" to block ads, sponsored posts, and suggested reels. However, others argued that extensions are a temporary fix for a "toxic" medium, suggesting the only real solution is to delete social media accounts entirely.
*   **Media Intent:** Regarding the article's note on Fox News amplifying a fake video about food stamps, a commenter debated whether this was simple incompetence or a form of "laundering" false information to drive a specific narrative before retracting it.
