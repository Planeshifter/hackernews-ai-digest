Restate introduces a simple yet powerful way to build resilient applications seamlessly within your current infrastructure, be it on FaaS, K8s, servers, or containers. Whether self-hosted or fully managed, Restate adapts to your setup. The latest version, Restate 1.0, along with Restate Cloud and a successful seed funding round, brings a feature-rich platform offering workflows as code, async tasks, timers, schedulers, microservice orchestration, and more.

Workflows as code in Restate empower developers to handle failures gracefully and ensure reliable execution to completion, even in the face of errors. By memoizing results and actions in a journal, redundant steps are avoided during retries. The platform allows for building workflows using regular code and control flow, eliminating the need for custom DSLs. With features like durable sleeps, the code can suspend for extended periods, making complex tasks more manageable.

API calls and webhooks are seamlessly integrated within Restate, enabling smooth coordination between synchronous code and asynchronous events. Webhooks and events persist in Restate's log, ensuring reliable and timely delivery to services. By leveraging features like Persistent Promises/Futures, Restate guarantees the completion of tasks, regardless of the duration, without re-executing completed steps.

Asynchronous tasks in Restate are executed durably and asynchronously, whether deployed serverless or as containers or processes. Functions can be called synchronously, asynchronously, or with delayed invocation, offering flexibility in designing complex patterns like fan-out, fan-in, task chains, and sub-tasks. Persistent timers and virtual queues aid in scheduling tasks effectively and enforcing strict task order and concurrency.

Stateful event processing in Restate simplifies event handling, providing durable functions as event handlers without the hassle of manual offset management, scaling, or balancing. Events from sources like Kafka can be processed seamlessly by deploying serverless functions on FaaS, ensuring exactly-once state and allowing for delayed event processing.

Restate 1.0, with its innovative features and user-friendly design, promises to revolutionize application development and streamline workflows for developers.

### Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say CA Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://themarkup.org/2024/06/12/these-wrongly-arrested-black-men-say-a-california-bill-would-let-police-misuse-face-recognition) | 10 points | by [cdme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cdme) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662980)

The article discusses the concerns of three Black men who were wrongly arrested due to police misuse of face recognition technology. These cases highlight the potential for civil rights violations and unjust consequences for individuals and their families. The men are now speaking out against a California bill that would restrict police from using face recognition as the sole basis for search or arrest, calling for more corroborating evidence.

Despite the bill's passage in the Senate Public Safety Committee, critics argue that a face recognition "match" is not conclusive evidence and can lead to wrongful arrests. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, defends the legislation as a necessary step to prevent such injustices and improve civil rights protections in California.

The use of face recognition technology by law enforcement has raised concerns about accuracy and bias, especially in identifying individuals with dark skin or other underrepresented groups. The reliance on eyewitness testimony, coupled with face recognition results, can further complicate criminal investigations and contribute to wrongful convictions.

The experiences of these men underscore the importance of addressing the pitfalls of face recognition technology and ensuring that individuals are not unjustly targeted or arrested based on flawed or biased algorithms.

The discussion revolves around the argument that human judgment is critical in policing to ensure accuracy and benefit society by addressing errors and maintaining accountability. There is a comparison between human error in decision-making and the flaws of face recognition technology, highlighting the potential consequences of blindly trusting computer algorithms. 

The conversation delves into the issue of automation bias, where individuals have a tendency to rely on automated systems even when they present errors or questionable outcomes. An example from the 80s involving a Navy ship mistaking a commercial CD player for missile signals is used to illustrate the limitations of solely trusting computer systems.

There is a debate about the importance of human judgment versus computer analysis, with one side emphasizing the necessity of human questioning and accountability in decision-making, while the other side acknowledges the benefits of computer technology in certain fields like aviation. Additionally, the discussion touches on the challenges faced by law enforcement in utilizing face recognition technology and the need for a balanced approach that considers both human expertise and technological tools.
