### The GJK Algorithm: A weird and beautiful way to do a simple thing

#### [Submission URL](https://computerwebsite.net/writing/gjk) | 568 points | by [arithmoquine](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arithmoquine) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40660761)

Have you ever wondered how to determine if two shapes overlap in a simple yet intriguing way? Enter the Gilbertâ€“Johnsonâ€“Keerthi (GJK) algorithm - a unique method that simplifies this task. Imagine having shape A and shape B, both consisting of infinitely many points. The key idea is to check if there's a point present in both sets. By subtracting every point in one shape from every point in the other, and observing if the resulting set contains the origin, we can detect an intersection.

By taking the Minkowski difference of the two shapes, denoted as A âŠ– B, we aim to find a convex set containing the origin. This involves identifying a simplex (the simplest polytope enclosing a region) within A âŠ– B that encloses the origin. Using support functions to pinpoint the farthest points on each shape in a given direction, the algorithm strategically selects only essential points to construct the bounding simplex.

With the GJK algorithm, the goal is to efficiently find a simplex on A âŠ– B that encloses the origin or determine that none exists. By initiating with a point p in a random direction and evaluating the dot product of d and p, the algorithm progresses towards forming the simplex. If the dot product turns negative, signifying opposite directions, the algorithm detects a gap between the shapes, ultimately leading to a fascinating collision detection mechanism for any convex shape with defined support points.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the Gilbertâ€“Johnsonâ€“Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, a collision detection method for determining if two shapes overlap. Some users share their experiences with implementing GJK in the 1990s, pointing out challenges and improvements. Additionally, there are references to the algorithm's application in 3D animation software and the complexities of termination conditions in GJK. Further comments touch on mesh simplification, the intersection of convex sets, constructive solid geometry, and the practicality of GJK for real-world applications. The conversation also includes a link to a presentation on the GJK algorithm and an interactive demonstration of the Minkowski difference.

### Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say CA Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://themarkup.org/2024/06/12/these-wrongly-arrested-black-men-say-a-california-bill-would-let-police-misuse-face-recognition) | 10 points | by [cdme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cdme) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662980)

The article discusses the concerns of three Black men who were wrongly arrested due to police misuse of face recognition technology. These cases highlight the potential for civil rights violations and unjust consequences for individuals and their families. The men are now speaking out against a California bill that would restrict police from using face recognition as the sole basis for search or arrest, calling for more corroborating evidence.

Despite the bill's passage in the Senate Public Safety Committee, critics argue that a face recognition "match" is not conclusive evidence and can lead to wrongful arrests. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, defends the legislation as a necessary step to prevent such injustices and improve civil rights protections in California.

The use of face recognition technology by law enforcement has raised concerns about accuracy and bias, especially in identifying individuals with dark skin or other underrepresented groups. The reliance on eyewitness testimony, coupled with face recognition results, can further complicate criminal investigations and contribute to wrongful convictions.

The experiences of these men underscore the importance of addressing the pitfalls of face recognition technology and ensuring that individuals are not unjustly targeted or arrested based on flawed or biased algorithms.

The discussion revolves around the argument that human judgment is critical in policing to ensure accuracy and benefit society by addressing errors and maintaining accountability. There is a comparison between human error in decision-making and the flaws of face recognition technology, highlighting the potential consequences of blindly trusting computer algorithms. 

The conversation delves into the issue of automation bias, where individuals have a tendency to rely on automated systems even when they present errors or questionable outcomes. An example from the 80s involving a Navy ship mistaking a commercial CD player for missile signals is used to illustrate the limitations of solely trusting computer systems.

There is a debate about the importance of human judgment versus computer analysis, with one side emphasizing the necessity of human questioning and accountability in decision-making, while the other side acknowledges the benefits of computer technology in certain fields like aviation. Additionally, the discussion touches on the challenges faced by law enforcement in utilizing face recognition technology and the need for a balanced approach that considers both human expertise and technological tools.
