#### [Submission URL](https://cdm.link/benn-jordan-ai-poison-pill/) | 119 points | by [glitcher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=glitcher) | [186 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695401)

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and music, Benn Jordan has put forward an intriguing concept aimed at protecting artists from having their work exploited by generative AI music services. He introduces the notion of using "adversarial noise" as a strategic defense, a technique that is essentially a digital "poison pill" for AI data sets, preventing them from assimilating unauthorized music content. Although still in its early stages, the concept has captured attention for its potential to reshape how we interact with AI in creative spaces.

These techniques hinge on the fascinating world of adversarial noise poisoning—an area of AI research dedicated to manipulating and disrupting machine learning models. The strength of Jordan's approach lies in its adaptability: operating in the realm of sound, this method can affect any audio environment, potentially offering musicians a new layer of protection and control over their creations. What sets this apart is the ability to mask the audio in a way that's imperceptible to human listeners, but effectively "jams" AI attempts to study it.

The challenge remains significant, though, as executing these adversarial techniques demands substantial computational power, high-end hardware, and copious amounts of energy. However, as a proof of concept, it provides a launchpad for further innovation and refinement. The parallel here to early 2000s concerns over digital piracy is striking, except now the adversary is not human fans but machine algorithms.

Moreover, this has implications beyond mere protection from generative AI. Adversarial noise has applications in wider fields, including potential defense against AI surveillance—offering a glimpse into how humans might strategically interact with growing machine capabilities. The broader sphere of adversarial methods, encompassing everything from algorithm training to attack simulations, reveals the dual nature of these strategies: they serve both as a critique of AI's current limitations and a potential foundation for future development.

As we navigate the complex intersection of music, technology, and AI, Benn Jordan's innovative idea and ongoing research signify a critical step towards greater creative autonomy in the digital age, encouraging transparency and inviting a reflective approach to how AI reshapes our world.

The discussion around Benn Jordan's adversarial noise concept for protecting music from AI reveals a mix of technical skepticism, ethical debates, and cautious optimism. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Technical Challenges:
1. **Effectiveness Concerns**: Users cited Nicholas Carlini's [research](https://nicholascarlini.com/writing/2024/why--attack.html), arguing that adversarial defenses like noise poisoning are "fundamentally broken" because AI models can be retrained or data can be cleaned (denoised) to bypass such protections. For example, AI companies might filter out adversarial noise during preprocessing, rendering the defense obsolete.
2. **Evolving AI Models**: Advanced music generators (e.g., Riffusion) process audio as spectrograms, which could allow them to circumvent noise attacks. Techniques like phase randomization or filtering might neutralize adversarial perturbations, making the arms race between defenses and AI advancements unsustainable.
3. **Resource Intensity**: Implementing adversarial noise requires significant computational power, and maintaining such defenses as AI models evolve could become prohibitively expensive.

### Ethical and Practical Debates:
- **Copyright vs. Innovation**: Some argued that AI training on copyrighted material parallels human learning of abstract styles, raising questions about whether mimicking artistic styles infringes copyright. Others countered that AI companies profit from unlicensed data, calling for compensation models akin to music sampling rights.
- **Comparison to DRM**: Skeptics likened adversarial noise to early-2000s DRM—a well-intentioned but flawed solution. Optimists viewed it as a starting point for empowering artists, even if imperfect.

### Mixed Sentiment:
- **Praise for Concept**: Benn Jordan’s music-production background was noted as a strength, offering a practical, artist-centric approach. Some saw value in the idea as a symbolic stand for creative control.
- **Skepticism About Impact**: Critics doubted long-term viability, noting that AI’s rapid evolution could outpace defenses. The discussion highlighted an "arms race" dynamic, where adversarial techniques might only offer temporary protection.

### Broader Implications:
- The debate reflects wider tensions in AI ethics, touching on data ownership, labor (e.g., CAPTCHA-solving for AI training), and the need for legislative frameworks to address gaps in copyright law for generative AI.

In summary, while adversarial noise is seen as a creative countermeasure, its technical limitations and the adaptability of AI models cast doubt on its efficacy. The conversation underscores the need for both technological innovation and policy reform to balance artist rights with AI development.

In a new push to embrace Europe's rich tapestry of languages, researchers have introduced Teuken-7B-Base and Teuken-7B-Instruct, two multilingual large language models (LLMs) that support all 24 official languages of the European Union. The team, led by Mehdi Ali and comprised of 38 collaborators, has worked to overcome the English-centric bias of existing LLMs by creating models trained predominantly on non-English data. Utilizing a tailor-made multilingual tokenizer, these models aim to improve performance across several language benchmarks, such as ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA, specifically adapted for European contexts.

The models are detailed in an arXiv paper that delves into their development principles, including data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The work represents a significant step towards creating more inclusive language tools that reflect Europe's linguistic diversity. For those interested in learning more, the full paper is available on arXiv, and it promises to offer insights into the technical intricacies behind these cutting-edge language models.

The discussion revolves around multilingual LLM behaviors, challenges, and implications, with key points structured as follows:

### **Language Switching & Translation**
- Users observe models like ChatGPT and Claude often *switch languages mid-reasoning* (e.g., Chinese for calculations, English for final answers), suggesting non-English prompts may be internally translated to English for processing. This mirrors practices like translating Turkish queries to English and back for better results with models like Llama 70B.
- Some theorize LLMs use an *internal "lingua franca"* (likely English) for intermediate reasoning, especially for low-resource languages, due to training data biases.

### **Technical Factors**
- **Temperature settings**: Lower temperatures (e.g., 0) aim to reduce randomness but may not fully eliminate variability due to token sampling mechanics. Inference engines might use static seeds for reproducibility.
- **Programming language preferences**: LLMs perform better with languages like Python/JS due to abundant training data. Strict-syntax languages (e.g., Pascal, C89) pose challenges, as LLMs struggle with rigid structures and variable declarations.

### **Cultural & Linguistic Biases**
- Models often default to English or Western-centric outputs, reflecting training data dominance. For instance, French users note ChatGPT’s informal French lacks local slang, leaning toward “neutral” or formal styles.
- Debate arises around the *Sapir-Whorf hypothesis*: Could language choice reshape model reasoning? Anthropic’s research suggests Claude uses language-agnostic internal representations, hinting at abstract reasoning beyond specific languages.

### **Resource & Training Challenges**
- Low-resource languages struggle due to limited data, leading to reliance on translation pipelines or code-switching. Users note models may use explicit translation steps in training (e.g., translating non-English text to English and back), limiting fluency.
- Tokenization issues: Multilingual tokenizers may struggle with underrepresented languages, fragmenting words and reducing coherence.

### **Theoretical Insights**
- Anthropic’s work highlights cross-lingual reasoning capabilities, implying larger models may develop language-neutral internal representations. This aligns with observations of models like Teuken-7B, which emphasize linguistic inclusivity beyond English-centric paradigms.

### **Ironies & Anecdotes**
- Jokes about ChatGPT sprinkling random Chinese characters or ancient Greek in outputs underscore the unpredictability of multilingual generation.
- French users humorously critique ChatGPT’s “generic” French, likening it to a textbook rather than native speech.

### **Implications for Teuken-7B**
- The discussion underscores the importance of Teuken’s focus on **EU language equity** through tailored tokenizers and non-English data. Challenges raised (e.g., translation reliance, tokenization) highlight areas where Teuken could advance multilingual support beyond current models.
