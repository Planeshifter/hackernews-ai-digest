### Simplicity – Google SRE Handbook (2017)

#### [Submission URL](https://sre.google/sre-book/simplicity/) | 127 points | by [nateb2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nateb2022) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40478470)

Today's highlight from Hacker News is a discussion around the chapter titled "Simplicity" from a book that delves into the inner workings of Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The chapter emphasizes the importance of simplicity in software systems, quoting C.A.R. Hoare: "The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity." It articulates how software systems, being inherently dynamic and unstable, require a delicate balance between stability and agility. The text mentions the concept of "exploratory coding," where temporary code is written with an expiration date to allow for more liberal testing and experimentation. It also stresses the need for both stability and agility in production software systems, with SREs working to enhance reliability without hindering developer agility.

Furthermore, the chapter touches upon the virtue of "boring" in software, highlighting the importance of predictability and the avoidance of surprises in production. It distinguishes between essential complexity that is inherent in a problem and accidental complexity that can be eliminated through engineering efforts. Lastly, the chapter addresses the emotional attachment engineers may have to their code and the challenge of simplifying systems by eliminating unnecessary complexity. It underlines the importance of avoiding unnecessary code bloat and the risks associated with keeping redundant or unneeded code in the codebase.

In conclusion, the chapter on "Simplicity" provides valuable insights into the principles of managing software systems with a focus on reliability, stability, and the pursuit of simplicity in a dynamic and ever-changing environment.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the highlighted submission revolves around various viewpoints shared by the community members. Here are the key points summarised:

1. **zbntly** and **cmmntrs** critique Google's principles of hypocrisy in following reliability practices and suggest that organizations are not humans, implying different priorities.

9. **ChrisArchitect** shares a link to a recent discussion on a related topic, encouraging further engagement on the subject.

The community provides diverse perspectives on the need for simplicity, reliability, emotional considerations, and the practical challenges faced in software engineering and organizational decision-making.

### Google scrambles to manually remove weird AI answers in search

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/24/24164119/google-ai-overview-mistakes-search-race-openai) | 253 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [339 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40475578)

Google is in a frenzy as they scramble to manually remove bizarre AI responses from their search results, with examples ranging from advising users to put glue on pizza to suggesting they eat rocks. The company's new AI Overview feature, which initially rolled out in beta in May 2023, seems to be generating unusual and meme-worthy responses, causing swift actions to disable these responses for specific searches. Although Google has boasted about the cost efficiency of delivering AI answers, the recent issues highlight a gap between optimizing costs and ensuring quality output. Some experts believe that achieving the last 20 percent accuracy with AI, which involves reasoning and fact-checking akin to human intelligence, is the real challenge.

Amidst competition from other AI-focused companies like Bing, OpenAI, and emerging AI startups, Google faces pressure to enhance its search capabilities, especially with younger users favoring experiences like TikTok. Despite grand plans for expanding AI Overview features, Google's current focus is on rectifying the basics to maintain its reputation in the evolving AI landscape.

- Users on Hacker News are discussing the challenges Google is facing with bizarre AI responses in search results and the need for manual interventions to remove them.
- Some users shared similar instances from the past where search algorithms produced unintended and humorous results.
- There is a debate on the balance between maximizing cost efficiency and ensuring the quality of AI outputs, particularly in achieving the last 20% accuracy akin to human intelligence.
- Google's competition in the AI space, including Bing, OpenAI, and emerging startups, is mentioned, highlighting the pressure on Google to enhance its search capabilities, especially among younger users.
- The conversation touches on Google Answers, Quora, and the complexities of AI in achieving accurate and human-like responses.
- Discussions also delve into the deterministic nature of large language models (LLMs) and the challenges in training AI systems to produce accurate and reliable outputs, highlighting the nuances between predictability and randomness in AI processes.
