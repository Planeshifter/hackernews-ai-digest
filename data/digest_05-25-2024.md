#### [Submission URL](https://sre.google/sre-book/simplicity/) | 127 points | by [nateb2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nateb2022) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40478470)

Today's highlight from Hacker News is a discussion around the chapter titled "Simplicity" from a book that delves into the inner workings of Google's Site Reliability Engineering (SRE). The chapter emphasizes the importance of simplicity in software systems, quoting C.A.R. Hoare: "The price of reliability is the pursuit of the utmost simplicity." It articulates how software systems, being inherently dynamic and unstable, require a delicate balance between stability and agility.

The text mentions the concept of "exploratory coding," where temporary code is written with an expiration date to allow for more liberal testing and experimentation. It also stresses the need for both stability and agility in production software systems, with SREs working to enhance reliability without hindering developer agility.

Furthermore, the chapter touches upon the virtue of "boring" in software, highlighting the importance of predictability and the avoidance of surprises in production. It distinguishes between essential complexity that is inherent in a problem and accidental complexity that can be eliminated through engineering efforts.

Lastly, the chapter addresses the emotional attachment engineers may have to their code and the challenge of simplifying systems by eliminating unnecessary complexity. It underlines the importance of avoiding unnecessary code bloat and the risks associated with keeping redundant or unneeded code in the codebase.

In conclusion, the chapter on "Simplicity" provides valuable insights into the principles of managing software systems with a focus on reliability, stability, and the pursuit of simplicity in a dynamic and ever-changing environment.
