#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/parallel-processing-unit) | 123 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41612665)

A new startup, Flow Computing, is shaking up the CPU landscape with the promise of a 100x performance boost. Co-founder Timo Valtonen envisions a shift from traditional CPUs to an innovative architecture that combines standard CPU cores with 64 specialized 'parallel processing units' (PPUs). This hybrid approach aims to enhance efficiency by optimizing the handling of both sequential and parallel tasks, which are essential for modern computing needs, particularly as the demand for high-performance AI applications grows.

Valtonen and his team recently shared their vision at the Hot Chips conference, advocating for a system that can efficiently manage workloads of varying sizes while addressing key challenges in memory latency and synchronization. By separating the roles of CPUs and PPUs, Flow Computing aims to unlock significant processing power without the need for costly GPUs, heralding a new era of computing where CPUs regain their central position in technology.

The discussion around Flow Computing's new architecture highlighted several key points and concerns. Participants discussed the challenges posed by traditional CPU designs when addressing tasks that require both high parallelism and efficient sequential processing. Some commenters noted the historical context of parallel processing and mentioned similar attempts in the past, like the Cell processor, which also aimed to optimize performance but faced challenges in software adaptation.

Several users speculated on the implications of Flow Computing's PPUs (Parallel Processing Units) versus existing GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) architectures. There was a debate on whether Flow Computing’s approach would effectively fill a niche that GPUs and NPUs (Neural Processing Units) currently occupy. 

Others drew parallels to previous architectures, noting the experience with similar specialized processing units and how they have not always met expectations, citing issues with memory latency and programming models. The discussion also touched on potential limitations of the new approach and the extent of its market viability compared to established competitors like Intel and AMD.

Overall, while there was interest in the concept of combining CPUs with specialized PPUs to boost performance significantly, skepticism remained regarding practical implementation and acceptance within existing technological frameworks. The conversation included various technical details and reflections on past hardware attempts, framing a broader understanding of the landscape Flow Computing is entering.

Microsoft’s recent Phi-3 models, for instance, deliver impressive performance that sometimes rivals that of larger models, but are easier to run on consumer hardware. Not only do these tools benefit researchers in remote locations, but they allow for customization tailored to specific scientific needs, such as proofreading manuscripts or summarizing research papers.

Overall, the landscape of AI in research is evolving, making sophisticated computational tools more accessible and versatile, with the potential to revolutionize how scientists interact with data right at their fingertips. As technology continues to advance, we can expect more researchers to join Thorpe in this practical approach to AI, unlocking a new realm of possibilities in scientific exploration.

In a recent Hacker News discussion surrounding a submission about local artificial intelligence (AI) usage in scientific research, commenters shared insights and experiences with various local models, such as those from Mozilla and LlamaCpp. Some noted challenges like hardware constraints and the performance of local models compared to online services like ChatGPT. Users expressed frustration with telemetry in tools like Visual Studio Code, highlighting the importance of privacy—a theme echoed in conversations about using local AI to mitigate dependency on the internet.

Participants discussed the capabilities of local models, including customization for specific tasks like document proofreading and data summarization. There were mixed experiences regarding setup and performance, with some praising the flexibility of local models while others reported slower performance on limited hardware. The community also noted that as AI technology evolves, more users would likely embrace local options for enhanced control and privacy. Overall, the discourse underscored a growing interest in the practical applications of local AI models in research and development settings.

### Dissociating language and thought in large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.06627) | 40 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41613492)

A recently updated paper titled "Dissociating language and thought in large language models" explores the cognitive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through the lens of formal and functional linguistic competence. Authors Kyle Mahowald and colleagues emphasize a critical distinction: while LLMs excel in understanding linguistic rules (formal competence), their ability to use language effectively in real-world contexts (functional competence) remains inconsistent. This difference mirrors findings from human neuroscience, suggesting that LLMs may require distinct mechanisms to integrate both forms of competence. The research highlights the current limitations of LLMs, indicating that truly human-like language use may necessitate advancements in their cognitive architectures. Published in *Trends in Cognitive Sciences*, this work offers critical insights for future AI development and our understanding of language processing.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the paper "Dissociating language and thought in large language models" highlights various perspectives on the cognitive limitations of LLMs. Users elaborate on the complexity of language processing, suggesting that human brains utilize multiple networks to interpret and produce language effectively. They draw parallels between LLMs and human linguistic capabilities, emphasizing that while LLMs exhibit formal linguistic competence, their functional competence—applying language in real-world contexts—requires significant improvement.

One commenter references Anthropic's work on interpretability in LLMs, suggesting that advancements in understanding how these models work could enhance their application. Another participant points out the constraints stemming from LLMs' limited context windows and proposes that integrating memory systems could lead to more cohesive and contextually relevant outputs. Overall, the discussion reflects a shared interest in addressing LLMs' shortcomings and exploring potential avenues for enhancing their cognitive architectures to achieve better language processing outcomes.
