In a recent video, popular YouTuber @Mrwhosetheboss criticized the Google Pixel 8 Pro for off-loading all generative AI tasks to the cloud. Despite Google advertising the device as "AI-first," it appears that the Tensor G3 processor in the Pixel 8 Pro is not able to handle these tasks on-board and requires a constant internet connection for processing. @Mrwhosetheboss noted that this leads to a sluggish user experience and suggests that the Tensor G3 chip is not quite flagship-level. This raises questions about Google's claims regarding the AI processing capabilities of the Tensor G3 and its overall performance metrics. It seems that Arm CPUs and GPUs, which are used in the Tensor G3, play a crucial role in processing AI tasks on the device. Additionally, Google faced controversy when it blocked reviewers from easily installing benchmark apps during the review embargo period, hinting at potential performance concerns. Overall, the Pixel 8 Pro's handling of generative AI tasks and its processor's capabilities have come under scrutiny.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the criticism of the Google Pixel 8 Pro and its handling of generative AI tasks. Some users express surprise at the device relying on cloud processing for AI tasks instead of being able to handle them on-board. Others mention that the Tensor G3 chip in the Pixel 8 Pro is likely capable of handling AI tasks locally, but Google's strategy is to offload computation to the cloud. There is also discussion about Google blocking reviewers from easily installing benchmark apps during the review embargo period, hinting at potential performance concerns. One user points out the advantage of Google's approach of offloading computation to the cloud, while others mention the disadvantages. There is also debate about the comparison of the Tensor G3 chip to other processors, such as the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8. Some users discuss the internet requirement for the Pixel 8 Pro and speculate on the reasons behind it. Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the Pixel 8 Pro's handling of AI tasks and its processor's capabilities.

### AI Reduces the World to Stereotypes

#### [Submission URL](https://restofworld.org/2023/ai-image-stereotypes/) | 177 points | by [gigama](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gigama) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37963909)

BuzzFeed faced controversy when it posted a list of images of Barbie dolls representing different countries, generated using artificial intelligence (AI) image generator Midjourney. The dolls contained numerous flaws and biases, such as light-skinned Asian Barbies and blonde-haired dolls representing countries like Thailand and the Philippines. This example highlights the biases and stereotypes prevalent in generative AI text-to-image systems. Bloomberg's analysis of over 5,000 AI-generated images also revealed biases, with higher-paying job titles associated with lighter skin tones and male-dominated results for most professional roles. A new analysis by Rest of World focused on national identities and found that Midjourney held biases, stereotypes, and reductionism for different countries, such as using an old man with a beard to represent an Indian person, and representing Mexican people as men wearing sombreros. Such stereotypical portrayals can flatten cultural diversity and lead to harm. Generative AI has various applications, including advertising, creative industries, and forensic sketches, meaning that how communities are represented can be heavily influenced by AI tools. Further progress is needed to address the biases and ensure the accurate representation of diverse cultures and communities.

The discussion surrounding the submission primarily focuses on the biases and limitations of generative AI image models like Midjourney. Commenters highlight the stereotypes and reductionism present in the AI-generated images, such as the portrayal of Mexican people wearing sombreros and Indian people represented as old men with beards. Some argue that the models have an incomplete understanding of cultural diversity and rely on clichés and generalizations. Others point out that the models may not have been properly trained or prompted to provide accurate representations. The conversation also touches on the challenges of labeling training data and the need for improved diversity and inclusion in AI models. Some commenters suggest that the current models may not have a deep understanding of different cultures and call for further progress in addressing biases and ensuring accurate representation. Additionally, there is a brief discussion about the role of ethnicity in AI-generated images and the importance of avoiding oversimplification and generalization.
