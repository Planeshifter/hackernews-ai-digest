#### [Submission URL](https://www.moment.dev/blog/lies-i-was-told-pt-1) | 233 points | by [antics](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=antics) | [79 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42343953)

In a revealing exploration of collaborative editing systems, Alex Clemmer shares his findings in the latest Moment devlog. Initially optimistic about algorithmic solutions for both online and offline collaborative editing, Clemmer soon discovered the stark reality: popular algorithms like CRDTs and OT often fail to provide an intuitive offline editing experience, leading users to perceive their actions as data corruption.

Clemmer outlines how these systems struggle with conflicts that arise during offline edits. He highlights a specific example involving two users, Alice and Bob, making conflicting changes to a document. As they come online, it becomes a challenge for the system to reconcile their edits without prior context, ultimately illustrating the limitations of current approaches.

Despite these obstacles, there's a flicker of hope. Recent shifts in the research community are starting to treat collaborative editing not just as an algorithmic challenge, but as a design problem with user experience at its core. Clemmer encourages this evolving perspective, suggesting that the future of collaborative tools may lie in understanding the needs of users better, rather than solely relying on algorithmic solutions.

Whether you're a developer or simply interested in collaborative technologies, Clemmer's insights provide a thought-provoking look at both the limitations and potential of collaborative editing systems today. Stay tuned for further installments where he will delve deeper into these issues and share more innovative solutions!

In a recent discussion on Hacker News, users engaged deeply with Alex Clemmer's exploration of the challenges faced by collaborative editing systems. Key points include:

1. **Limitations of Current Algorithms**: Users remarked on the shortcomings of algorithms like CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types) and Operational Transformation (OT) in managing offline edits and conflict resolution. Several commenters shared examples, indicating that existing solutions often lead to a frustrating user experience, where actions can feel like data corruption.

2. **Holistic Design Approach**: Some participants highlighted the importance of prioritizing user experience alongside algorithmic solutions. They agreed with Clemmer that understanding user needs and treating collaborative editing as a design problem could yield better outcomes.

3. **Proposals for Improvement**: Ideas for addressing these issues included leveraging more sophisticated machine learning models and maintaining a more structured historical context of edits, akin to how version control systems like Git operate.

4. **Skepticism and Optimism**: While some commenters expressed skepticism about purely algorithmic solutions improving user experience, others remained optimistic about the potential of new methodologies and designs for enhancing collaborative editing tools.

Overall, the dialogue emphasized a collective exploration of both the inherent complexities in collaborative editing and the path forward that balances technical innovation with user-centric design.

### Show HN: Prompt Engine – Auto pick LLMs based on your prompts

#### [Submission URL](https://jigsawstack.com/blog/jigsawstack-mixture-of-agents-moa-outperform-any-single-llm-and-reduce-cost-with-prompt-engine) | 86 points | by [yoeven](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yoeven) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42339302)

In a bid to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs), JigsawStack has launched the Mixture-Of-Agents (MoA) framework, powered by their innovative Prompt Engine. Recognizing that not all LLMs excel in every domain—like GPT-4o's prowess in customer support versus Claude 3.5's strength in coding tasks—the MoA approach combines the capabilities of multiple models to deliver superior performance.

The Prompt Engine simplifies the often cumbersome process of managing multiple LLMs by automating prompt creation and execution. Developers need only define a solid prompt and desired output structure; the engine explores the best-fitting LLMs from a pool of over 50 options, intelligently grouping the top contenders for the task at hand. This not only enhances response accuracy but also helps reduce costs through efficient token usage and prompt caching.

When it’s time to run the engine, a ranking model assesses the outputs from the selected LLMs and delivers the best results in a consolidated format. With continuous learning capabilities, the framework adapts to improve quality over time, minimizing issues like hallucinations while trimming down redundant models for faster outputs. 

Moreover, JigsawStack ensures that developers can seamlessly upgrade to newer models without disrupting existing code through backward compatibility. The community is encouraged to join JigsawStack’s Discord and Twitter for collaboration and support. This innovative solution not only streamlines LLM deployment but also marks a significant leap in the quest for optimal language model orchestration.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding JigsawStack's Mixture-Of-Agents (MoA) framework primarily revolves around the framework's capability to enhance language model performance through prompt optimization and model selection. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Model Selection and Performance**: Users debated the effectiveness of switching between different models based on specific tasks. It's acknowledged that different models, like GPT-4o and Claude, have varying strengths. Some comments highlight the challenge of dynamically switching models within practical applications.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: There were discussions about the role of the Prompt Engine in improving the accuracy of the responses by refining how prompts are structured. Users expressed interest in how the engine could prevent tokens from being wasted and improve overall performance.

3. **Quality Discrepancies**: Participants noted the subjective differences in output quality between smaller models and larger ones, suggesting that even slight changes in the model can lead to drastic variations in results.

4. **Practical Applications**: A few users shared their practical experiences regarding using LLMs for specific coding tasks, mentioning challenges like generating HTML pages or handling media processing with different APIs.

5. **Concerns Over Limitations**: Some comments included skepticism about the framework's capability, with particularly noteworthy consumer experiences about the models’ output not meeting expectations in certain cases.

Overall, while there is excitement around the potential of the MoA framework in optimizing prompts and selecting the right models, there are also concerns and discussions about model effectiveness, quality inconsistency, and practical application challenges.
