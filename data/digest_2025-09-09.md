#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/create-files) | 621 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [323 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45182381)

Anthropic’s Claude can now create real files (spreadsheets, docs, slides, PDFs) from chat

What’s new
- In Claude.ai and the desktop app, Claude can generate and edit Excel, Word/Docs, PowerPoint/Slides, and PDFs—not just text replies.

What you can do
- Turn raw data into cleaned datasets, charts, statistical analyses, and written insights.
- Build spreadsheets with working formulas, multi-sheet models, project trackers, dashboards, budgets with variance calculations.
- Convert across formats (e.g., PDF report → slide deck; meeting notes → formatted doc; invoice uploads → organized spreadsheets).

How it works
- “Claude’s computer”: a private compute environment where Claude writes code and runs programs to produce files, shifting it from advisor to hands-on collaborator.

Access
- Preview now for Max, Team, and Enterprise; Pro to follow in the coming weeks.

Getting started
- Enable “Upgraded file creation and analysis” under Settings > Features > Experimental.
- Upload files or describe the output you want, iterate in chat, then download or save to Google Drive.
- Start simple (data cleaning, basic reports) before moving to complex models.

Caveat
- This feature uses internet access to create/analyze files; Anthropic warns it may put data at risk. Monitor chats and be mindful of sensitive information.

Why it matters
- Pushes LLMs beyond advice into deliverables, shrinking the gap between idea and execution.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Anthropic’s Claude File-Creation Feature:**

1. **Technical Insights & Naming Confusion**  
   - Users debated whether the feature should be called **"Claude’s Computer"** (server-side container) or "Code Interpreter," noting differences from ChatGPT's implementation. The backend reportedly runs in a **sandboxed Ubuntu/Python/Node.js environment** with restricted network access and whitelisted domains (e.g., PyPI, GitHub).  
   - Some reverse-engineered the setup, revealing limitations like **disabled internet access for analysis tools** and reliance on proxies. Security concerns arose over potential data risks in this environment.  

2. **Reliability & Consistency Issues**  
   - Multiple users reported **frustration with inconsistent results**:  
     - Generated files (e.g., spreadsheets, charts) sometimes fail to update or include hallucinations (e.g., fake data columns, broken formulas).  
     - Simple tasks (formatting, basic queries) were surprisingly error-prone, while complex tasks occasionally succeeded.  
   - Comparisons to **ChatGPT’s Code Interpreter** highlighted reliability gaps, though some praised Claude’s unique capabilities like multi-sheet Excel models.  

3. **Transparency & Documentation Gaps**  
   - Criticisms centered on **poor documentation** and unclear boundaries for allowed tools/features (e.g., JavaScript execution, file permissions). Users argued over whether "RTFM" (read the docs) was feasible given the sparse official guidance.  
   - Confusion persisted about the distinction between **"artifacts" (previously existing) and the new sandboxed file-generation system**.  

4. **Cost Concerns & Performance Woes**  
   - **Pro users ($20/month)** and **Enterprise users** expressed frustration over degraded performance (slower responses, frequent errors) despite high costs. One user joked about the $200/month "Pro Plus" tier feeling unpolished.  
   - Speculation arose about Anthropic’s scaling challenges, with some attributing issues to rushed implementation.  

5. **Comparisons & Integrations**  
   - Users requested **Git integration** and better collaboration tools. Others pondered ties to AWS or GitHub for version control.  
   - Mixed opinions surfaced: Some saw potential for transformative workflows (e.g., turning PDFs into slides), while others dismissed it as a gimmick without reliability.  

**Key Sentiments**  
- **Mixed Reactions**: Excitement about the **potential** for AI-driven file creation clashed with frustration over **inconsistent execution** and lack of transparency.  
- **Developer Frustration**: Power users highlighted bugs and missing features but acknowledged incremental progress.  
- **Irony Noted**: The feature’s name ("Upgraded File Creation") drew mockery, as some felt it was a downgrade in practice.  

**Conclusion**: While Claude’s file-generation feature marks a step toward LLMs as practical tools, the discussion underscores growing pains—technical limitations, unclear documentation, and reliability hurdles—that Anthropic must address to bridge the gap between hype and utility.

**Conclusion**: The thread reflects cautious optimism about EU tech sovereignty efforts but underscores skepticism about regulatory, political, and cultural obstacles. ASML’s investment in Mistral is viewed as both a strategic lifeline and a test of Europe’s ability to reconcile national interests with collective innovation goals.

### Anthropic judge rejects $1.5B AI copyright settlement

#### [Submission URL](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/anthropic-judge-blasts-copyright-pact-as-nowhere-close-to-done) | 283 points | by [nobody9999](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nobody9999) | [292 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45179304)

Judge balks at Anthropic’s $1.5B author copyright deal, demands specifics

- US District Judge William Alsup denied preliminary approval (without prejudice) of Anthropic’s proposed $1.5B class settlement with authors, saying he felt “misled” and the agreement is “nowhere close to complete.” A minute order postponed approval pending more detail.
- Key gaps: a definitive list of covered works (currently ~465,000), clear notice to potential class members, and a concrete claims process. Alsup wants a per-work, opt-in system for all copyright holders; if any co-owner opts out, that title is excluded. Ownership disputes should go to state court.
- The judge warned against “hangers on” and an “army” of add-on attorneys, saying they won’t be paid from the fund; attorney fees must track actual payouts to authors.
- Authors’ counsel said they expect high claim rates; publishing groups involved to untangle complex rights splits. The Association of American Publishers criticized the court’s approach as unworkable.
- Why it matters: The proposed $3,000-per-book framework could set a benchmark for resolving similar AI training suits against OpenAI, Meta, and others—but Alsup’s conditions signal courts will insist on robust notice, clean releases, and clear ownership before blessing billion‑dollar AI copyright deals.
- Deadline: Parties must submit a final list of works by Sept. 15. Case: Bartz v. Anthropic PBC, N.D. Cal., 24-cv-5417.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around corporate accountability, legal liability, and the contrast between penalties for individuals vs. corporations, prompted by the rejection of Anthropic’s $1.5B copyright settlement. Key themes include:

1. **Corporate vs. Individual Liability**  
   - Users debate whether executives and corporations face adequate consequences for misconduct. Examples like **Enron**, **Boeing’s 737 Max crashes**, **FTX (Sam Bankman-Fried)**, and **Theranos** highlight cases where executives avoided prison or received lenient sentences despite massive harm.  
   - Criticism of limited corporate liability structures shielding individuals, with calls for personal accountability (e.g., imprisoning executives or shareholders directly responsible for harm).

2. **Copyright Infringement Comparisons**  
   - Some contrast **Aaron Swartz’s prosecution** (criminal charges for academic article sharing) with corporate AI copyright cases (treated as civil matters with fines). This sparks debate over fairness and systemic inequities in legal enforcement.

3. **Fines vs. Criminal Charges**  
   - Fines are dismissed as ineffective "cost of doing business" measures. Users argue they fail to deter misconduct, advocating instead for criminal charges and prison terms to align incentives with public safety.  
   - Others counter that over-punishing accidents could stifle innovation, emphasizing incentives for safety improvements over punitive measures.

4. **Structural Legal Issues**  
   - Critiques of legal systems favoring corporations, with proposals to revoke corporate charters or impose stricter criminal liability for executives.  
   - Examples like **BP’s Deepwater Horizon spill** and **Bhopal disaster** underscore frustration with unpunished corporate negligence causing environmental harm or deaths.

5. **Broader Societal Implications**  
   - Calls for rethinking corporate personhood and liability structures to prevent harm. Some suggest societal complicity in prioritizing profit over accountability.  

**Conclusion**: The thread reflects a broader frustration with perceived legal double standards and systemic failures in holding corporations (and their leaders) accountable for large-scale harm, contrasting sharply with stricter enforcement against individuals. The discussion ties into ongoing debates about justice, corporate power, and the need for legal reforms.

### Source code for the X recommendation algorithm

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/twitter/the-algorithm) | 244 points | by [mxstbr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mxstbr) | [137 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45183039)

X (Twitter) has open-sourced major pieces of its recommendation system (AGPL-3.0) used across For You, Search, Explore, and Notifications. The repo maps out how X builds, ranks, and filters feeds at scale, with code for both legacy and newer services.

What’s inside
- Shared data and signals: tweetypie (post storage), unified-user-actions (real-time user events), user-signal-service (explicit + implicit signals).
- Embeddings and models: SimClusters (community-based sparse embeddings), TwHIN (dense graph embeddings), trust-and-safety models (NSFW/abuse), real-graph (user–user interaction likelihood), tweepcred (PageRank-style reputation).
- Graph + features: UTEG on GraphJet for user–post traversal, graph-feature-service, topic-social-proof, representation-scorer, recos-injector.
- Serving frameworks: navi (Rust ML serving), product-mixer (feed assembly), timelines-aggregation-framework, representation-manager, twml (TF v1, legacy).

How “For You” is built
- Candidate generation:
  - In-network via search-index (~50% of feed).
  - Out-of-network via tweet-mixer, notably UTEG/GraphJet traversals and other graph-based sources.
- Ranking:
  - Light-ranker in Earlybird (search) for early scoring.
  - Heavy-ranker (neural network) for final ordering.
- Mixing and filtering:
  - home-mixer (built on product-mixer) assembles the feed.
  - visibility-filters enforce policy/compliance, quality, and revenue protection.
  - timelineranker is noted as a legacy relevance scorer.

Recommended Notifications
- pushservice is the main engine, with light and heavy rankers to winnow a large candidate pool into high-signal alerts.

Why it’s interesting
- Clear separation of candidate sourcing vs. ranking vs. policy filtering.
- Heavy reliance on embeddings (SimClusters, TwHIN) plus real-time graph traversals.
- Mix of modern infra (Rust-based navi) and legacy components (TF v1, timelineranker).
- Transparent look at how signals (likes, replies, profile visits, clicks) flow through the system.

Repo snapshot: ~65k stars, ~12k forks.

The Hacker News discussion about X (Twitter) open-sourcing its recommendation algorithm highlights several key themes:

1. **Skepticism About Practical Usefulness**  
   - Users question the value of releasing code without model weights or real-time data, arguing it offers limited insight into actual feed behavior. Competitors might analyze the architecture, but replicating Twitter’s system is seen as impossible without access to private signals (e.g., engagement metrics, user interactions) and proprietary training data.

2. **Transparency vs. Redaction Concerns**  
   - Many note heavy redactions in the code (e.g., environment variables, SQL queries), raising doubts about Musk’s claims of transparency. Comparisons are made to Tesla’s “open-sourced” Roadster code, which lacked practical utility. Concerns about hidden secrets or incomplete disclosures persist.

3. **Content Moderation & Political Bias**  
   - Users debate changes under Musk, such as the rebranded Community Notes (formerly Birdwatch) and allegations of political bias. Some claim non-verified users are suppressed, while others argue the platform now leans “neutral” compared to pre-Musk “liberal bias.” Grok’s politically charged outputs and Musk’s influence on moderation policies are criticized.

4. **Technical Critiques**  
   - Rust-based components (e.g., Navi) are praised, but legacy systems (TF v1) and incomplete code snapshots are flagged as limitations. Security risks from potential secret leaks in the code are highlighted.

5. **Decentralized Alternatives**  
   - Bluesky and Mastodon are mentioned as alternatives, though users acknowledge their recommendation systems are less sophisticated. Twitter’s centralized control is contrasted with decentralized platforms’ censorship resistance.

6. **Community Notes & Verification**  
   - While some praise Community Notes for crowdsourced fact-checking, others criticize its cluttered UI and question its effectiveness compared to traditional moderation. The $8 verification system is seen as amplifying influencers over journalists.

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism about the strategic value of the open-source release, concerns over Musk’s transparency narrative, and debates about Twitter’s evolving content policies under his leadership.

### Hallucination Risk Calculator

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/leochlon/hallbayes) | 113 points | by [jadelcastillo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jadelcastillo) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45180315)

HallBayes: post‑hoc hallucination risk bounds and answer/refuse gating for OpenAI models

- What it is: A MIT‑licensed toolkit that turns any OpenAI Chat Completions prompt into a per‑query hallucination risk bound and an automatic ANSWER or REFUSE decision under a target SLA—no retraining required. Repo: leochlon/hallbayes (≈800⭐).

- How it works:
  - Builds “rolling priors” by weakening the prompt into skeletons (either erase provided evidence or mask entities/numbers for closed‑book).
  - Measures information lift between the full prompt and skeletons via clipped log‑prob differences, yielding an information budget in nats.
  - Uses the Expectation‑level Decompression Law (EDFL) to bound achievable reliability via a Bernoulli KL term; outputs a conservative risk-of-hallucination bound.
  - Decision rule: compares the information budget to Bits‑to‑Trust for a target hallucination rate h*. Uses worst‑case prior for strict gating, average prior for the risk bound.

- Why it’s interesting:
  - Provides transparent math and per‑query guarantees instead of heuristics.
  - Works with standard OpenAI models (e.g., gpt‑4o, gpt‑4o‑mini) and the Chat Completions API.
  - Aimed at teams shipping LLM features who need measurable SLAs for correctness/refusal.

- Observed behavior and tips:
  - Simple arithmetic can trigger refusals (low information lift); named‑entity factoids often pass.
  - Mitigations: score Correct/Incorrect instead of Answer/Refuse, add a mask‑aware refusal head, relax h* or margins, increase sampling, or provide compact evidence to boost lift.

- Practical notes:
  - pip install openai; set OPENAI_API_KEY; works via m weakened prompts and n samples (cost/latency trade‑off).
  - OpenAI‑only; bounds depend on skeleton design and are intentionally conservative.

Key concepts: EDFL, information lift (nats), Bits‑to‑Trust, Information Sufficiency Ratio, dual‑prior gating (average for bounds, worst‑case for SLA).

The discussion around HallBayes and LLM hallucination risks reveals several key themes:

1. **Skepticism of LLM Reliability**  
   Multiple users compare LLMs to "1-900 psychic hotlines" or "scams," criticizing token usage costs and unreliable outputs. Some argue LLMs inherently lack reasoning ability, likening their responses to probabilistic token generation rather than structured reasoning.

2. **Practical Use-Case Challenges**  
   Users share mixed experiences with tasks like CSV transformations, noting instances where LLMs introduced subtle errors or required manual correction. Others highlight the difficulty of trusting outputs for critical workflows, with one anecdote about Claude correcting grammar but still requiring human oversight.

3. **Methodological Critiques**  
   Commenters question HallBayes' theoretical foundations, pointing out inconsistencies in the linked paper and suggesting it leans more on "philosophical pseudomath" than empirical validation. A NeurIPS 2024 paper on compression failures is referenced as a more rigorous alternative.

4. **Hallucination Mitigation Strategies**  
   A proposed system prompt framework aims to reduce hallucinations by scoring responses on factual accuracy, meta-cognitive recognition, and penalty avoidance. However, others note the challenge of defining clear metrics for hallucination risk.

5. **AI-Generated Content Concerns**  
   Subthreads discuss the blurry line between human and AI-generated content, particularly on platforms like LinkedIn, and the need for better detection tools. Some joke about "stealth hallucinations" slipping into professional writing.

6. **Community Sentiment**  
   While some praise the technical ambition of tools like HallBayes, skepticism dominates—calls for refunds for "wasted tokens" and comparisons to outdated models (*txt-davinci-002*) underscore frustrations with current LLM limitations. Humorous replies (e.g., "Ding dong ding winner!") reflect a mix of resignation and dark comedy about these issues.

### The Last Programmers?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.xipu.li/posts/the-last-programmers) | 45 points | by [kiyanwang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kiyanwang) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45180353)

The Last Programmers: A former Amazon engineer says hand-coding is ending

Summary:
- Author left Amazon’s Q Developer team for startup Icon, frustrated by slow, KPI-driven decisions and risk-averse process. Example: forcing Builder ID auth instead of GitHub, adding friction while rivals like Cursor and Anthropic shipped weekly.
- At Icon, a teammate ships features by writing plain-English design docs and orchestrating multiple Claude Code terminals (via Whispr Flow voice control). He edits the doc, not the code; only rarely debugs by hand.
- Role shift: coding is ~20% of the job and mostly specification; the valuable work is user discovery, product judgment, and system design. Implementation is increasingly automated.
- Prediction: within 2–5 years, instant voice-to-code with near “bug‑free” quality; code becomes “the wiring behind your drywall”—trusted and mostly invisible.
- Cultural split: “experimenters” aggressively offload work to AI (seeing abstraction and “productive laziness” as progress) vs “guardians” who prize fundamentals, performance, and deep systems understanding, wary of shaky AI-built foundations.
- Core claim: we’re witnessing the last generation that translates ideas into code by hand; as models speed up and improve, who builds software—and how—will change.

Why it matters:
- Points to a developer role that’s more product and systems oversight, less manual implementation.
- Highlights how org choices (auth, process) can make or break adoption versus faster-moving competitors.
- Surfaces the looming tension teams must navigate: speed via AI automation vs rigor and reliability grounded in fundamentals.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion reflects a polarized debate on the future of programming and AI's role, sparked by the submission's claim that hand-coding is ending. Key points include:

### **Optimism for AI-Driven Shifts**
- **Efficiency & Role Evolution**: Some agree coding will become a smaller part of developers' roles, shifting focus to product design, system architecture, and high-level oversight. AI tools like Claude Code terminals and voice-controlled workflows are seen as accelerants for prototyping and mundane tasks.
- **Cultural Divide**: A split emerges between "experimenters" (who embrace AI for speed and abstraction) and "guardians" (who prioritize deep technical understanding and reliability). The latter worry AI may erode foundational skills.

### **Skepticism & Criticisms**
- **Limitations of AI**: Critics argue AI-generated code (e.g., GPT-4o’s SQL queries) often appears plausible but lacks logical correctness, especially in complex systems. Debugging, performance optimization, and nuanced problem-solving still require human expertise.
- **Corporate Shortcomings**: Amazon’s KPI-driven culture is criticized for stifling innovation, likened to the fable of *The Woodcutter and the Trees*—prioritizing short-term metrics over long-term quality. Similar concerns apply to AI hype in startups.
- **Quality vs. Scalability**: Analogies to Hershey’s chocolate (mass-produced but criticized for quality) highlight fears that AI could prioritize speed over craftsmanship, leading to "junk" code or systems.

### **Practical Concerns**
- **Tool Reliability**: Users note current AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) often produce errors or require heavy editing, especially in complex contexts. Voice-to-code and AI automation are seen as immature for critical tasks.
- **Human Oversight**: Many stress the need for human intervention to correct AI mistakes, validate outputs, and maintain system integrity. The "last 5%" of edge cases and performance tuning remain challenging for AI.

### **Cultural & Industry Reflections**
- **Nostalgia vs. Progress**: Some lament the potential loss of hands-on coding joy and logical rigor, while others welcome AI as a productivity booster. The debate mirrors broader tensions in tech (e.g., "move fast and break things" vs. artisanal craftsmanship).
- **Hype vs. Reality**: Skeptics dismiss AI startups as overhyped, advocating for traditional coding practices. Others acknowledge AI’s potential but stress it’s not yet a replacement for skilled developers.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores a transitional phase where AI’s role in coding is both promising and contentious. While automation may reduce manual implementation work, deep technical expertise and critical thinking remain vital. The divide hinges on whether AI will augment developers or undermine the discipline’s rigor—a question unresolved but intensely debated.

### Apple barely talked about AI at its big iPhone 17 event

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/apple-event/774963/apple-september-launch-event-ai-apple-intelligence) | 92 points | by [andrew_lastmile](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrew_lastmile) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45187841)

Apple’s iPhone 17 event downplays flashy AI, leans into “under-the-hood” gains

- Apple’s 75-minute keynote was light on Apple Intelligence hype, largely rehashing features first shown at WWDC (visual intelligence, live translation) that rivals like Google and Samsung shipped earlier.
- The pitch shifted to background AI powered by new silicon: an updated Neural Engine, local LLMs for smoother gaming, and neural accelerators built into each GPU core to deliver “MacBook Pro–level” on-device compute.
- AirPods updates emphasized live translation and health metrics; Apple says an on-device model for activity/calorie tracking was trained on 50M hours from 250k participants.
- Apple Watch leans further into health AI: ML analyzes blood pressure responses over 30 days; Apple hopes to flag 1M cases of undiagnosed hypertension in year one, pending FDA clearance, based on studies with 100k+ participants.
- Context: As OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta pour tens of billions into AI, Apple faces scrutiny for lagging and a recent string of AI research departures to competitors.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion reflects mixed reactions to Apple’s emphasis on "under-the-hood" AI improvements for the iPhone 17, with skepticism and praise for different aspects:

1. **Hardware vs. Software Debate**:  
   - Critics question Apple’s investment in specialized AI hardware acceleration, arguing that third-party APIs (e.g., ChatGPT) already handle many tasks. Others counter that on-device processing improves privacy and reliability.  
   - Concerns about battery drain and storage demands (e.g., 1TB iPhones) are raised, with comparisons to Android’s expandable storage options.  

2. **Privacy and Security**:  
   - Users express unease about AI accessing sensitive data (e.g., health metrics, location tracking), with some calling Apple’s AI a “snitch” or “spyware.”  
   - Security risks like prompt injection attacks are mentioned, though evidence of exploitation remains limited.  

3. **Marketing vs. Substance**:  
   - Many note Apple’s deliberate avoidance of AI buzzwords, opting for terms like “Apple Intelligence” and focusing on practical ML-driven features (e.g., health analytics, live translation). Critics dismiss this as rebranding existing ML tech, while supporters praise the understated approach.  
   - Siri’s stagnation is criticized as emblematic of Apple’s lag in visible AI innovation.  

4. **Comparisons and Alternatives**:  
   - Android’s affordability and flexibility (e.g., microSD support) are contrasted with Apple’s premium pricing.  
   - Some users prefer background AI enhancements (e.g., smarter photo organization) over flashy features, though others find Apple’s tools lacking compared to competitors like Google Photos.  

5. **Terminology and Research**:  
   - Debates arise over the distinction between “AI” and “machine learning,” with frustration toward marketing-driven hype cycles. Apple’s research into on-device models is acknowledged, but recent departures of AI researchers fuel doubts about long-term innovation.  

**Overall Sentiment**:  
While some applaud Apple’s focus on privacy and incremental hardware-driven improvements, others view it as playing catch-up or masking a lack of groundbreaking AI advancements. The discussion highlights tension between practical, behind-the-scenes ML applications and consumer expectations for transformative AI features.

### I don't want AI agents controlling my laptop

#### [Submission URL](https://sophiebits.com/2025/09/09/ai-agents-security) | 73 points | by [Bogdanp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bogdanp) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45188982)

Sophie Alpert argues that giving AI agents blanket control of a local machine is fundamentally unsafe because desktop OSes aren’t built for fine‑grained, trustworthy isolation. Even if you usually approve one command at a time, flipping to “always allow” turns your whole user account—and its secrets—into an attack surface.

Key points:
- Modern OSes lack practical ways to grant broad access while excluding sensitive items (password managers, banking, ~/.aws/credentials, env vars). Separate user accounts exist but few people use them for isolation.
- The “lethal trifecta” risk means even rare failures can be catastrophic; recent missteps (e.g., Perplexity) and the lack of a solid solution from major AI vendors underline the danger.
- Safer near-term path: run agents in cloud/VM sandboxes with constrained credentials. Bonus: reproducibility, parallel sessions, easier team collaboration. Codex already leans this way; Claude Code is moving there.
- Browsers are the other promising boundary: per-site isolation is mature, and a browser-integrated agent could let users selectively grant access to specific sites with enforced origin sandboxes.
- This likely requires control of the browser itself. Alpert sees Atlassian’s partnership with The Browser Company as a smart bet for enterprise SaaS, where distribution via a purpose-built “work browser” makes sense.

Bottom line: Treat local agents as untrusted. Expect a shift toward cloud sandboxes and browser-native permission models, not blanket control of your laptop.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around Sophie Alpert’s stance on AI agents controlling laptops centers on **security risks**, **trust in corporations**, and **technical mitigation strategies**, with recurring skepticism about current OS safeguards and corporate accountability.

### Key Themes:
1. **Security Foundations & OS Limitations**  
   - Modern OSes (Windows, Linux, BSDs) are criticized for lacking granular access controls, forcing users to rely on cumbersome workarounds like separate accounts, VMs (e.g., QubesOS), or sandboxing tools (e.g., `bwrap`). These solutions are seen as too complex for average users.  
   - Users propose running AI agents in restricted environments:  
     *Locked Kubernetes namespaces, disposable VMs, or browser-based sandboxes* to limit access to sensitive data (e.g., `~/.aws/credentials`, env vars).  

2. **Corporate Control & Autonomy**  
   - Microsoft and GitHub Copilot are singled out for enabling opaque AI integrations that bypass user consent, likened to “spyware” behavior. Examples include Copilot auto-enabling features or accessing repositories without explicit permissions.  
   - Skepticism toward AI vendors prioritizing hype over security, with parallels drawn to crypto’s “sell shovels to miners” profit model.  

3. **Workflow Trade-offs**  
   - Concerns about AI agents disrupting productivity or introducing vulnerabilities for minor gains. Some dismiss the risks as overblown (“creating absolute dumpster fires”), while others advocate strict isolation.  

4. **Generational Shifts in Privacy**  
   - Predictions that younger generations (GenZ/Gen5) will normalize AI control over personal devices, despite privacy erosion. Older users mock resigned acceptance (“embracing the filter”) but highlight risks of corporate-controlled AI dictating workflows.  

5. **Technical Mitigations**  
   - **Sandboxes**: Kubernetes, Docker, and VM-based isolation praised for reproducibility and access restrictions.  
   - **Hardware Solutions**: Dedicated devices/KVM switches to compartmentalize AI agent activity.  
   - **Browser Integration**: Leveraging per-site isolation (e.g., Chrome’s origin sandboxes) for safer agent permissions.  

### Notable Quotes:  
- *“Microsoft isn’t interested in sharing control… [they’ll] tell people what permissions are allowed”* — Criticism of centralized corporate control.  
- *“It’s called embracing the filter… no different than giving up autonomy to any software”* — Sarcastic take on AI’s inevitability.  
- *“Run agents in an empty home directory with `bwrap`… a VM is even better”* — Practical isolation advice.  

### Consensus:  
While some dismiss AI agent risks as inflated, most agree with Alpert’s warnings: **local AI agents should be treated as untrusted**, with cloud-based sandboxes, strict permissions, and browser-native security models as safer paths. Trust in corporations to prioritize user security remains low, driving calls for open-source, user-configurable solutions.

**Key Takeaway**: The debate centers on whether gold’s rise signals a pragmatic hedge against systemic risks or reflects speculative fearmongering. While some dismiss it as irrational in a virtual economy, others see it as a timeless store of value amid AI-driven disruption and institutional erosion.
