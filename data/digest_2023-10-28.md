#### [Submission URL](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/10/how-to-think-computationally-about-ai-the-universe-and-everything/) | 109 points | by [jam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jam) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38049774)

In a recent talk at TED AI, Stephen Wolfram discussed the concept of computation and its implications for understanding the universe. Wolfram argued that computation is not just a possible formalization of the world, but the ultimate formalization for our universe. He explained that space and matter are made up of discrete elements, and the structure of the universe is defined by the network of relations between these elements. Using computational rules, the entire universe can be built from these discrete elements. Wolfram also discussed the emergence of gravity and quantum mechanics from these computational rules, and how different observers perceive the branching paths of the universe. He introduced the concept of the "ruliad," which is the unique object that encompasses all possible computational processes. Wolfram explained that observers, like us, can only sample specific slices of the ruliad, and that our perceived laws of physics are a result of our computational limitations and our belief in persistence in time. Overall, Wolfram presented a new paradigm for understanding the universe through computation, with implications for various fields including physics, mathematics, biology, and economics.

The discussion around Stephen Wolfram's talk at TED AI seems to be divided. Some people, like "nologic01," argue that Wolfram's computational theory fails to explain the complexities of the universe and that his models do not align with modern physics. They believe that his approach lacks evidence and does not stand up to experiments. Others, like "vnb," find Wolfram's ideas intriguing and see potential connections between computation and understanding the universe, though they are unsure about the validity of his claims. There is also discussion about the limitations of computational models and the need for empirical testing. Additionally, there are comments expressing skepticism about the usefulness of Wolfram's theories in practical applications, such as addressing climate change or building a stable society. Overall, the discussion explores the extent to which computation can explain the mysteries of the universe and the challenges of modeling complex systems.
