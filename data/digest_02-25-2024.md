### Mamba Explained: The State Space Model Taking On Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/2024/02/11/mamba.html) | 252 points | by [koayon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=koayon) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39501982)

Today on Hacker News, the spotlight is on a new player in the world of AI models - Mamba. While Transformers have been dominating the AI scene, a fresh alternative called State Space Models (SSMs) has entered the ring with promises of similar performance and faster processing speeds. Mamba tackles the issue of long sequences by eliminating the quadratic bottleneck in the Attention Mechanism, allowing it to handle million-token sequences efficiently. The Mamba authors claim that their model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches those twice its size in both pretraining and downstream evaluation tasks. This breakthrough opens up a realm of possibilities across various modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

Diving deeper, Mamba's approach differs from the traditional Transformer architecture by using a Control Theory-inspired SSM for communication between tokens while retaining MLPs for computation within tokens. This innovative structure aims to address the limitations of Transformers, particularly the quadratic bottleneck that hampers performance with increasing context size. By providing an intuitive analogy involving Temple Run, the article elucidates how Mamba leverages the concept of state dynamics to predict optimal outcomes based on current observations.

In the age of Transformers where attention is key, Mamba's emergence offers a fresh perspective on how AI models can handle massive amounts of data efficiently. Could Mamba be the next big thing in AI? Stay tuned for more updates on this intriguing development!
