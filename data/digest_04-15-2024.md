### State tax officials are using AI to go after wealthy payers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/15/state-tax-officials-use-ai-to-go-after-wealthy-payers.html) | 13 points | by [perihelions](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=perihelions) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40046152)

New York State's tax department is getting serious about auditing high earners, reporting a 56% increase in audits in 2022, even with fewer auditors. The secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence.

Using sophisticated AI algorithms, the state is targeting individuals who have potentially avoided paying taxes, especially those who have relocated during the pandemic to low-tax states like Florida or Texas. By analyzing factors like cellphone records to determine residency and work patterns, the state is challenging the legitimacy of these moves and holding individuals accountable for taxes owed.

Additionally, New York is scrutinizing remote workers, arguing that even if someone lives outside the state, if they work for a New York-based company, they are still liable for New York taxes. The state's "convenience rules" are leading to audits based on the idea that if someone retained belongings in New York, they didn't truly move, despite having established homes in other states.

These aggressive tactics are part of a broader trend where state tax authorities are leveraging AI to target high-income individuals and ensure tax compliance. It's a reminder that even in the digital age, tax authorities are keeping a close eye on financial activities.
