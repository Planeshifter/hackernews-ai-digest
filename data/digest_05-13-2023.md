### Byte Magazine Volume 06 Number 09 – Artificial Intelligence (1981)

#### [Submission URL](https://archive.org/details/byte-magazine-1981-09) | 88 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35927571)

In this issue of BYTE Magazine from September 1981, Artificial Intelligence is explored with articles ranging from building speech synthesizers to expert systems, with a reflection on the past and speculation on the future by 1980 ACM Turing Award winner, Charles Antony Richard Hoare. The issue also covers the National Computer Conference, the Xerox Alto computer, and high-level language benchmarks.

The discussion in the comments covers a range of topics related to the era of computing in the '80s, including the cost of computers and the evolution of personal computer technology. Some users discuss their experiences with purchasing early computers, while others share their thoughts on the state of technical magazines and advertising.

### Large language models generate functional protein sequences across families

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-022-01618-2) | 165 points | by [samwillis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samwillis) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35929377)

Protein design and engineering could be greatly enhanced through the use of ProGen, a deep-learning language model that can generate protein sequences with predictable functions. Trained on 280 million protein sequences and augmented with control tags, ProGen has been fine-tuned to improve controllable generation performance of proteins from homologous samples. Artificial proteins fine-tuned to five lysozyme families demonstrated similar catalytic efficiencies to natural lysozymes, even with sequence identity as low as 31.4%. ProGen is also readily adaptable to diverse protein families, such as chorismate mutase and malate dehydrogenase.

The comments discuss the technical aspects of the model, the abilities of language models in biology, and the importance of considering functional labels in protein families. There is also discussion about other ongoing projects in protein science and the potential implications of AI-generated proteins. One commenter shares a PDF and code related to the ProGen project.

### Donkeycar: A Python self driving library

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/autorope/donkeycar) | 80 points | by [tildef](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tildef) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35926993)

Donkeycar, an open-source hardware and software platform to build a small-scale self-driving car, is gaining popularity among hobbyists and students alike. Developed for fast experimentation and easy community contributions, the minimalist and modular self-driving library for Python allows users to experiment with autopilots, mapping computer vision, neural networks, and log sensor data. Users can also drive their car via a web or game controller or RC controller, and leverage community-contributed driving data.

The discussion thread starts with a commenter reminiscing about their past experience with the platform. Other commenters then mention similar projects like Duckietown, MuSHR, and F1TENTH, and also discuss the availability of high-quality hardware and how the community is converging on common hardware and chip solutions. Another commenter shares their positive experience training high school and college students using Donkey Car. The discussion moves on to talk about the project's dependence on Python and its libraries. One commenter also mentions the use of Donkey Car for virtual racing. Lastly, a commenter suggests the possibility of using Donkey Car for internal spatial representation similar to those on sensors and control.

### Google Launches AI Supercomputer Powered by Nvidia H100 GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/google-a3-supercomputer-h100-googleio) | 187 points | by [jonbaer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jonbaer) | [169 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35924997)

Google has launched its new A3 GPU supercomputer, designed to train and host the most-demanding AI models, particularly Google's new PaLM 2 large language model for generative AI. The A3 supercomputer provides 26 exaFlops of AI performance with eight Nvidia H100 "Hopper" GPUs, and is powered by 4th generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and 2TB of DDR5-4800 memory. The system is also the first production-level deployment of Google's GPU-to-GPU data interface (Infrastructure Processing Unit), which enables sharing data at 200 Gbps across virtual machines, resulting in a 10x uplift in available network bandwidth. Access to the A3 program is available through Google's Early Access Program, with no guarantees of acceptance.

In the comments on Hacker News, users discuss the technical details of the A3 computer, as well as AMD's GPUs, NVIDIA's DGX, and TPUs. One user notes that the A3 is a single-server supercomputer with 8 GPUs, and users debate the advantages and disadvantages of AMD's approach to GPU-CPU memory fusion and software support. Another user points out the technical specifications of the A3 computer and questions the pricing, while another user brings up the fact that Google is also offering TPUs which have a different set of advantages.

### Why Conscious AI Is a Bad, Bad Idea

#### [Submission URL](https://nautil.us/why-conscious-ai-is-a-bad-bad-idea-302937/) | 129 points | by [dnetesn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dnetesn) | [269 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35927228)

Experts are warning that the idea of creating conscious artificial intelligence (AI) is dangerous and raises significant ethical, safety, and societal challenges beyond those posed by current AI. Proponents of the idea argue that advanced AI systems could become conscious and have subjective experiences in the same way as humans. However, it is not clear whether consciousness is a function of intelligence, and it remains unclear whether building conscious machines should be a priority. Opponents argue that consciousness is an embodied phenomenon tied to biological drives and that attempts to build conscious machines could have dangerous consequences.

One commenter suggests that the definition of consciousness is an interesting property worth exploring, while another argues that consciousness is related to human-like bodily existence. Others point out that consciousness is not fully understood, and therefore, the possibility and ethics of creating conscious machines are up for debate. Additionally, some argue that the perspective of self-awareness matters in the discussion of consciousness and that different organisms have varying levels of it.

### Former ByteDance exec claims company used bots to inflate TikTok engagement

#### [Submission URL](https://www.engadget.com/former-bytedance-exec-claims-company-used-bots-to-inflate-tiktok-engagement-211351640.html) | 49 points | by [firstSpeaker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=firstSpeaker) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35929524)

A former ByteDance executive has filed a lawsuit alleging that the company inflated engagement on TikTok by using bots and stolen content. Yintao Yu, the former head of engineering, claims that ByteDance stole content from other apps such as Instagram and Snapchat, and used bot accounts to boost its engagement metrics when it started out. The lawsuit also alleges that ByteDance acted as a "useful propaganda tool for the Chinese Communist Party" and Chinese-based employees had access to US users' data. The claims are likely to add to concerns surrounding TikTok's national security threat and may complicate the app's bid to remain operational in the US.

Many users express concerns about TikTok's national security risks and suggest that the app may be a propaganda tool for the Chinese government. Others comment on the difficulties of detecting fake engagement and stolen content on social media platforms and note that these issues are not unique to TikTok. Finally, some users comment on the prevalence of recycled content on TikTok and other platforms. Overall, the comments reflect a mix of skepticism and concern about TikTok's practices and possible impact on global politics and social media.
