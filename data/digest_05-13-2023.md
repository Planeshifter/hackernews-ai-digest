Rsync Time Machine is a Python script that offers Time Machine-style backups using rsync. It creates incremental backups of files and directories to the destination of your choice. The backups are structured in a way that makes it easy to recover any file at any point in time on Linux, macOS, and Windows (via WSL or Cygwin). The main advantage over Time Machine is flexibility, as it can backup from/to any filesystem and works on any platform. It is fully tested, has no external dependencies (only Python ≥3.7), offers pretty terminal output, and is fully typed.

A user shared "rsync-time-machine," which is a python script that provides incremental backups of files. The backups are structured to make it easy to recover any file at any point in time on Linux, macOS, and Windows platforms. The tool has no external dependencies (only Python ≥3.7), pretty terminal output, and is fully tested and typed. Some users mentioned other backup tools such as rsnapshot and said they would check out rsync-time-machine, while other users shared their experiences with implementing systems for backups. One user found the python implementation a bit difficult to implement and suggested checking ssh-pythn.

### OpenBSD 7.3 on the es40 Dec Alpha emulator

#### [Submission URL](https://virtuallyfun.com/2023/05/10/openbsd-7-3-on-the-es40-dec-alpha-emulator/) | 48 points | by [jandeboevrie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jandeboevrie) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35928362)

OpenBSD 7.3 Alpha has been released for those who want to play with virtual DEC Alpha stuff, but it is incredibly slow and requires a serial console, since using the VGA console will result in a crash on an assert. The installation takes over an hour and the root password is "password." One user built it from gdwnldsKSC after amputating the pcap based networking code to smooth the compile. There are no compilers or X11 since the networking has been amputated.

The discussion on this submission mainly revolves around the root password, which is "password." Some users are commenting on the insecurity of having such a simple password, while others are poking fun at it. One user suggested trying different variations of the password, while another pointed out that the password is only relevant for those who are playing with the virtual DEC Alpha and not using it for serious purposes.

Another user mentioned that they were able to successfully compile the OpenBSD 7.3 Alpha but had to remove the networking code to do so. They noted that there are no compilers or X11 available in this release.

Towards the end of the discussion, a user commented that they had built a working IBM 1401 emulator and System360 emulator running on QEMU, which caught the attention of some other users.

### Why Conscious AI Is a Bad, Bad Idea

#### [Submission URL](https://nautil.us/why-conscious-ai-is-a-bad-bad-idea-302937/) | 129 points | by [dnetesn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dnetesn) | [269 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35927228)

Experts are warning that the idea of creating conscious artificial intelligence (AI) is dangerous and raises significant ethical, safety, and societal challenges beyond those posed by current AI. Proponents of the idea argue that advanced AI systems could become conscious and have subjective experiences in the same way as humans. However, it is not clear whether consciousness is a function of intelligence, and it remains unclear whether building conscious machines should be a priority. Opponents argue that consciousness is an embodied phenomenon tied to biological drives and that attempts to build conscious machines could have dangerous consequences.

Experts are warning against creating conscious AI, citing significant ethical, safety, and societal challenges beyond those posed by current AI. While proponents argue that advanced AI systems could have subjective experiences and become conscious like humans, opponents argue that consciousness is an embodied phenomenon tied to biological drives, and that attempts to build conscious machines could have dangerous consequences. One commenter suggests that the definition of consciousness is an interesting property worth exploring, while another argues that consciousness is related to human-like bodily existence. Others point out that consciousness is not fully understood, and therefore, the possibility and ethics of creating conscious machines are up for debate. Additionally, some argue that the perspective of self-awareness matters in the discussion of consciousness and that different organisms have varying levels of it.
