In an innovative exploration of neural network capabilities on low-end microcontrollers, a tech enthusiast has managed to successfully implement an MNIST digit classification model on the extremely resource-constrained Padauk PMS150C microcontroller. This device features just 1KB of one-time-programmable memory and a mere 64 bytes of RAM, making it one of the smallest available microcontrollers.

The journey began with the realization of significant potential in quantization aware training, which paved the way for downscaling MNIST images from their original 28x28 resolution to a minimalist 8x8 format. Despite the drastic reduction in image fidelity, the author discovered that it was still feasible to train a machine learning model to recognize digits with impressive accuracy.

The study involved extensive experimentation with various neural network configurations, revealing a fascinating relationship between model size and accuracy. With appropriate adjustments, including using 2-bit weights and minimizing latent parameters to accommodate the RAM limits, a successful model achieved a remarkable 90.07% accuracy while fitting within just 0.414 kilobytes of memory.

Following initial trials on a more robust Padauk model, the challenge of fitting the trained model onto the PMS150C required clever programming optimizations. By flattening the code structure and leveraging assembly programming for efficiency, the author was able to push the boundaries of what’s achievable with such limited resources.

This accomplishment not only showcases the potential for machine learning on low-power edge devices but also opens avenues for developing practical applications that can run on minimal hardware.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and technical intricacies of implementing a neural network on the Padauk PMS150C microcontroller, focusing particularly on memory management and performance optimization. Participants discuss the inherent limitations of the microcontroller's architecture, which includes its extremely low RAM and one-time-programmable memory, noting that function calls and return-stack mechanisms consume RAM, making it crucial to optimize these aspects.

Several commenters express interest in quantization methods, such as utilizing 2-bit weights, to minimize memory usage while maintaining performance. Discussion also touches on the feasibility of running this implementation alongside other simple tasks, with some contributors reminiscing about their past experiences with similarly constrained devices.

There’s curiosity about potential assembly code optimizations and whether specific architecture constraints, like those from RISC-V, could improve efficiency. Enthusiasts highlight the creative workarounds, such as flattening code structures and managing memory read/write cycles effectively, which are essential for successful execution on such limited hardware.

Overall, the conversation emphasizes the excitement of pushing the boundaries of machine learning capabilities on low-power edge devices and the necessity for clever programming to overcome the inherent limitations of the Padauk PMS150C microcontroller.
