### I deleted my second brain

#### [Submission URL](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain) | 529 points | by [MrVandemar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MrVandemar) | [324 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44402470)

In a bold move against the tide of digital hoarding, Joan Westenberg recently erased her entire "second brain"—a meticulously curated collection of over 10,000 digital notes compiled over seven years. This vast trove of insights, quotes, and ideas, stored in systems like Obsidian and Apple Notes, was meant to enhance her productivity and creativity by capturing every fleeting thought. However, it became clear that instead of empowering her, it had turned into an oppressive weight stifling her curiosity and genuine thought processes.

The concept of a "second brain," popular among productivity enthusiasts, promises clarity and enhanced memory by externalizing and organizing one's thinking into a digital network. Yet, Westenberg found this system morphed into a mausoleum of past ideas and identities, diminishing her mental agility and curiosity. In her reflective journey, largely influenced by her sobriety milestones, she realized that true progress came not from archived notes but from lived experiences and personal evolution.

Citing cultural and psychological insights, Westenberg critiques the misconception that human memory functions like static data storage. Human cognition, she argues, thrives on the chaos and fluidity of life, not on rigidly categorized files. The promise of total capture through Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems often results in stored but unreflected upon ideas, creating an illusion of mastery without true understanding.

Furthermore, she addresses the guilt associated with unread reading lists, recognizing that her vast database of unread material served more as a monument to her ambitions than as a roadmap to wisdom. By letting go of this digital excess, Westenberg embraces a more organic and improvisational approach to learning and growth, one that favors true engagement over mere accumulation.

This act of digital decluttering, she suggests, is a liberating release from the tyranny of productivity tools that can ensnare their users. By returning to a simpler state of mental inquiry and presence, Westenberg champions the value of forgetting as a natural and necessary aspect of genuine knowledge and self-discovery.

In a world obsessed with capturing and categorizing, Westenberg’s story is a refreshing reminder of the power of letting go and trusting one's instincts to guide learning and creativity.

   A tangential thread debated long-term data storage, with users comparing HDDs, SSDs, and magnetic tape (LTO). Tape was noted for its cost-effectiveness and durability for archival purposes, though some questioned its practicality versus cloud storage or periodic data migration.

4. **Psychological Reflections**:  
   Participants explored the emotional weight of digital hoarding, comparing it to physical clutter. Some argued that retaining vast amounts of data creates a "psychological burden," while others admitted struggling with the fear of losing potentially valuable information. The act of decluttering was framed as a way to reclaim mental space and focus on the present.

5. **Nostalgia vs. Progress**:  
   A few users defended revisiting old notes or journals, citing the joy of rediscovering past perspectives. One mentioned how revisiting a 20-year-old HTML project sparked creativity. However, others countered that overly fixating on the past hinders growth, with one quipping, "Sometimes it’s nice to remind yourself you’ve [already] lived."

6. **Humor and Skepticism**:  
   Lighthearted critiques emerged about AI-generated comments (noting their "poetic but hollow" style) and the irony of productivity systems becoming distractions. One user joked that obsessive note-taking often feels like "insight hoarding" rather than genuine learning.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a tension between the desire to capture knowledge and the freedom of letting go. While some advocate for structured systems, many resonate with Westenberg’s conclusion: true growth often lies in lived experience, not archived data. As one user succinctly put it: "Human brains thrive on chaos, not categorization."
