**The Great Note Purge: Why One Writer Deleted Their 'Second Brain'**

In a bold move against the tide of digital hoarding, Joan Westenberg recently erased her entire "second brain"—a meticulously curated collection of over 10,000 digital notes compiled over seven years. This vast trove of insights, quotes, and ideas, stored in systems like Obsidian and Apple Notes, was meant to enhance her productivity and creativity by capturing every fleeting thought. However, it became clear that instead of empowering her, it had turned into an oppressive weight stifling her curiosity and genuine thought processes.

The concept of a "second brain," popular among productivity enthusiasts, promises clarity and enhanced memory by externalizing and organizing one's thinking into a digital network. Yet, Westenberg found this system morphed into a mausoleum of past ideas and identities, diminishing her mental agility and curiosity. In her reflective journey, largely influenced by her sobriety milestones, she realized that true progress came not from archived notes but from lived experiences and personal evolution.

Citing cultural and psychological insights, Westenberg critiques the misconception that human memory functions like static data storage. Human cognition, she argues, thrives on the chaos and fluidity of life, not on rigidly categorized files. The promise of total capture through Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems often results in stored but unreflected upon ideas, creating an illusion of mastery without true understanding.

Furthermore, she addresses the guilt associated with unread reading lists, recognizing that her vast database of unread material served more as a monument to her ambitions than as a roadmap to wisdom. By letting go of this digital excess, Westenberg embraces a more organic and improvisational approach to learning and growth, one that favors true engagement over mere accumulation.

This act of digital decluttering, she suggests, is a liberating release from the tyranny of productivity tools that can ensnare their users. By returning to a simpler state of mental inquiry and presence, Westenberg champions the value of forgetting as a natural and necessary aspect of genuine knowledge and self-discovery.

In a world obsessed with capturing and categorizing, Westenberg’s story is a refreshing reminder of the power of letting go and trusting one's instincts to guide learning and creativity.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Joan Westenberg's decision to delete her "second brain" reflects a mix of agreement, personal anecdotes, and technical debates on knowledge management and digital hoarding:

   - Valuing journals or analog notebooks as less overwhelming alternatives to digital PKM tools.  

3. **Technical Debates on Storage**:  
   A tangential thread debated long-term data storage, with users comparing HDDs, SSDs, and magnetic tape (LTO). Tape was noted for its cost-effectiveness and durability for archival purposes, though some questioned its practicality versus cloud storage or periodic data migration.

4. **Psychological Reflections**:  
   Participants explored the emotional weight of digital hoarding, comparing it to physical clutter. Some argued that retaining vast amounts of data creates a "psychological burden," while others admitted struggling with the fear of losing potentially valuable information. The act of decluttering was framed as a way to reclaim mental space and focus on the present.

5. **Nostalgia vs. Progress**:  
   A few users defended revisiting old notes or journals, citing the joy of rediscovering past perspectives. One mentioned how revisiting a 20-year-old HTML project sparked creativity. However, others countered that overly fixating on the past hinders growth, with one quipping, "Sometimes it’s nice to remind yourself you’ve [already] lived."

6. **Humor and Skepticism**:  
   Lighthearted critiques emerged about AI-generated comments (noting their "poetic but hollow" style) and the irony of productivity systems becoming distractions. One user joked that obsessive note-taking often feels like "insight hoarding" rather than genuine learning.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a tension between the desire to capture knowledge and the freedom of letting go. While some advocate for structured systems, many resonate with Westenberg’s conclusion: true growth often lies in lived experience, not archived data. As one user succinctly put it: "Human brains thrive on chaos, not categorization."

### In the Age of AI, Is Code Literacy Your Superpower?

#### [Submission URL](https://pmbanugo.me/blog/ai-code-literacy) | 10 points | by [eddieos](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eddieos) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44408573)

In a world increasingly dominated by AI-generated code, the ability to read and understand code might just be your superpower. While AI tools like ChatGPT can efficiently churn out code, the real challenge—and skill—is in comprehending what’s under the hood. As my thoughts wandered back to the lively discussions at JSCraftCamp, I stumbled upon an intriguing notion: reading code quickly and understanding it is a critical skill that many programmers may take for granted. 

Daniel Lamire, reflecting on this idea, noted that even with the power of AI at your fingertips, understanding code remains elusive for those who lack this literacy. As a coder, I find myself carefully poring over AI-generated code from GitHub Copilot, ensuring no sneaky bugs slip through. This practice not only forces me to engage deeply with what AI creates, but it also reinforces the idea that you, the coder, are ultimately responsible for the shipped code, AI-crafted or not.

The so-called "vibe coding" trend—focusing solely on problem-solving and overlooking the quality of code—doesn’t sit right with me. Good code matters because it’s your safety net against future bugs and performance issues. Think of it as a delicate balancing act: solve the right problems, but do so with robust code. 

Empirical research backs this up, showing that developers spend a significant portion of their time—between 58% and 70%—just reading and understanding code. This underscores the importance of code literacy, an unchanged constant from past programming paradigms to today's AI-assisted developments.

The bottom line? AI may write the code, but it’s the real engineers who read, refine, and sometimes scrap it. As we navigate this AI-driven age, it’s this fundamental skill that separates a casual coder from a true software craftsman. So, keep your reading glasses handy—your future self will thank you.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the challenges and frustrations of working with AI-generated code, emphasizing the necessity of human oversight. Participants liken current AI code generation to a "bad coworker" who produces verbose, low-quality, or error-prone code, necessitating frequent corrections during code reviews.  

Key points raised:  
- **Current AI Shortcomings:** AI-generated code often leads to cumbersome PR processes, requiring reviewers to repeatedly request changes due to verbosity, lack of adherence to best practices, or subtle errors.  
- **Comparison to Human Code:** Maintaining poorly written AI code is seen as equally problematic as maintaining bad human-written code, though some argue AI lacks the adaptability ("unable to learn") and intuition of human developers.  
- **Future Hopes:** Participants express optimism that future AI iterations will improve, reducing these pain points.  

Ultimately, the consensus mirrors the submission’s thesis: **AI can generate code, but human engineers remain essential for ensuring quality, maintainability, and correctness.** The dialogue underscores that code literacy and meticulous review are irreplaceable skills in an AI-augmented workflow.
