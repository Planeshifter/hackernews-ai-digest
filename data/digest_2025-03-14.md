### Show HN: LLM-docs, software documentation intended for consumption by LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Dicklesworthstone/llm-docs) | 21 points | by [eigenvalue](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eigenvalue) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43364640)

In a fascinating new project shared on Hacker News, a user named Dicklesworthstone has developed "LLM-Docs", a repository that provides streamlined and optimized documentation specifically tailored for efficient consumption by Large Language Models (LLMs). This ingenious initiative seeks to improve the way LLMs process documentation by eliminating redundant details, promotional content, and complex formatting that typically bogs down traditional human-centric documentation.

The idea originated from a tweet suggesting the necessity of condensing documentation for popular programming libraries in a way optimized for LLMs’ understanding and consumption. The goal is to take comprehensive, full-length documentation from well-known libraries and use advanced models like Claude 3.7 to distill it into a compact, plain-text format that is both easily interpretable by LLMs and efficient in terms of token usage.

LLM-Docs provides a pilot example with the Marqo Python library, showcasing the transformation of its documentation. Through a meticulous process involving collection, distillation, and organization, the project removes unnecessary redundancy while preserving critical technical details, API references, usage examples, and common errors that are vital for programming tasks.

Notably, the distillation process is carefully crafted to favor LLM efficiency over human readability, embracing minimal markdown or plaintext formatting. This allows LLMs to parse the information effortlessly, without getting distracted by extraneous layout issues typically encountered in traditional documentation formats.

Since the distilled documentation is not suited for human developers but optimized for LLM processing, it opens new avenues in making programming documentation more accessible for AI models. Although monetization strategies remain unclear, the potential for widespread utility among developers leveraging LLMs is considerable, providing an efficient resource for enhancing LLM-assisted programming tasks. 

Such adaptive and efficient documentation could revolutionize the way models interact with open-source libraries by offering on-demand access to high-quality, distilled information across various programming languages and ecosystems.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the LLM-Docs project highlights both enthusiasm and practical challenges in optimizing documentation for LLMs. Key points include:  

- **Frustration with Existing Docs**: Users like **rkrts** shared experiences of struggling with overcomplicated, unstructured documentation (e.g., for libraries like Playwright, Django, Godot). This spurred efforts to create streamlined, LLM-friendly guides (e.g., an "Idiot’s Guide") in plain text/markdown, prioritizing brevity and machine readability.  

- **Optimization Challenges**: While **drktfln** praised the project’s potential, they noted implementation hurdles: efficiently distilling docs (e.g., using models like Claude), retrieving relevant sections during LLM tasks, and balancing simplicity with completeness. Tools like Sundown for HTML conversion were mentioned, but surfacing contextually relevant info remains nontrivial.  

- **Effectiveness vs. Tradition**: **gnvl** argued that LLMs might not necessarily *need* specialized documentation, as they can process traditional formats. They proposed empirical testing to compare performance with distilled docs versus raw materials. Others, like **Noumenon72**, highlighted Dagster’s success with LLM-readable docs using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), suggesting hybrid approaches.  

- **Community Interest**: Participants saw value in automating distillation (e.g., using Claude to generate code docs) and improving search strategies for faster context retrieval. However, concerns lingered about scalability and the complexity of cross-referencing in large codebases.  

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism: while LLM-tailored docs could reduce friction in AI-assisted coding, real-world viability hinges on solving distillation quality, retrieval efficiency, and integration with existing tools like RAG.

### AI scientists are sceptical that modern models will lead to AGI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2471759-ai-scientists-are-sceptical-that-modern-models-will-lead-to-agi/) | 37 points | by [Bluestein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bluestein) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43364754)

Amid the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence, a recent report indicates a shift in belief about the future of AI, specifically regarding the path to artificial general intelligence (AGI). A survey by the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence reveals that 76% of 475 AI researchers doubt that simply scaling up current AI models will lead to AGI, a system that rivals or surpasses human abilities. This marks a significant departure from the previous "scaling is all you need" mindset that dominated since the rise of generative AI models in 2022.

While tech companies plan to shell out a staggering $1 trillion on data centers and chips to fuel their AI ambitions, many experts argue that the benefits of scaling in traditional ways have plateaued. According to Stuart Russell from UC Berkeley, the lack of understanding alongside vast investments in scaling was always a misdirection. Increasing computational power and prolonged processing times for AI queries, considered as inference-time scaling, is not seen as a promising solution either.

Adding to this skepticism, 80% of surveyed researchers feel that current perceptions of AI capabilities are unrealistic. Though AI's achievements in specific tasks like coding are notable, they often stumble on basic errors and are far from ready to replace human workers, notes Thomas Dietterich of Oregon State University.

As the ultimate target of reaching AGI remains nebulous—with definitions ranging from outperforming humans on cognitive tests to generating massive profits—the journey towards truly humanlike AI continues to be riddled with uncertainty and debate.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion reflects skepticism about achieving AGI through scaling current AI models, echoing the submission's themes. Key points include:

1. **Complexity of the Human Brain vs. AI Models**:  
   Commenters highlight that comparing AI parameters (e.g., GPT-4’s 18 trillion) to the human brain’s complexity is misleading. The brain’s biological processes—such as DNA expression, mitochondrial functions, and neural feedback loops—involve intricate, dynamic systems beyond mere computational scaling. One user notes that DNA’s role in neural development and addressing schemes adds layers of complexity absent in AI architectures.

2. **Limitations of Current AI (LLMs)**:  
   Participants argue that Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at processing data but lack true understanding or self-awareness. A distinction is drawn between “Artificial Knowledge” (static datasets) and “Artificial General Intelligence” (dynamic, human-like reasoning). Some liken advanced AI to “Frankenstein’s monster,” warning of unintended consequences if systems evolve without deeper comprehension.

3. **Skepticism About Scaling**:  
   Despite tech giants investing billions, many agree with the submission’s claim that scaling alone is insufficient for AGI. Feedback loops, subsystems, and biological-inspired mechanisms are suggested as alternative pathways. One commenter stresses that current AI approaches are “unlikely” to replicate human-level intelligence through brute-force computation.

4. **Investment vs. Reality**:  
   While companies pour resources into scaling, the discussion acknowledges that much of this funding aims to explore new techniques beyond traditional model expansion. However, doubts persist about whether financial investments alone can bridge the gap to AGI.

In summary, the thread underscores a consensus that AGI requires breakthroughs beyond computational power—integrating biological insights, dynamic systems, and novel paradigms—rather than merely scaling existing models.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.propublica.org/article/using-ai-responsibly-for-reporting) | 66 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43363474)

ProPublica is making headlines by delving into the intersection of AI and investigative journalism. The nonprofit newsroom, known for exposing abuses of power, is using AI responsibly to sift through vast amounts of data and uncover accountability stories—like the recent one involving Senator Ted Cruz's claims of "woke" NSF grants.

When Cruz released a database alleging that over 3,400 grants promoted "woke" ideologies like Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) or neo-Marxist views, ProPublica's data editor Ken Schwencke saw an opportunity. He ran the list through a large language model, similar to the technology behind ChatGPT, to identify which grants were flagged and why. It turned out that Cruz’s sweeping categorization included projects simply acknowledging social inequalities or completely unrelated scientific endeavors, such as a study on mint plant evolution and a device to treat bleeding trauma.

ProPublica’s use of AI demonstrates how technology can empower journalists to efficiently analyze data, track patterns, and provide crucial oversight, especially amid politically charged claims. This case underscores the balance AI can strike in media literacy and accountability, highlighting its potential in contemporary reporting. 

As news continues to evolve under Donald Trump’s second presidency, ProPublica remains vigilant, focusing on justice, immigration, media scrutinies, and environmental regulations. Their work and the public’s vigilance are more critical than ever. By blending AI with investigative rigor, they are paving the way for innovative journalism and greater public understanding.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around ProPublica’s use of AI in investigative journalism, highlighting skepticism, technical challenges, and debates over media bias:

1. **AI Reliability Concerns**:

Users like **nsgnt** and **jk** express doubts about AI’s limitations in verifying claims, while **jgalt212** notes the “half-successful” nature of current prompting methods.

2. **Defense of ProPublica’s Rigor**:  
   Supporters, including **smnw** and **mkys**, emphasize ProPublica’s thorough fact-checking and data-backed reporting. They cite examples like exposés on healthcare, tax evasion, and policy impacts under both Trump and Biden, countering claims of ideological bias.

3. **Bias Debates**:  
   Users clash over perceived media bias. **adgjlsfhk1** raises concerns about racial disparities in AI tools like COMPAS, while **mkys** defends ProPublica’s neutrality, pointing to their critical coverage of both administrations (e.g., Biden’s border policies, Trump’s FAA decisions). **frfx** humorously references liberal bias via a Steven Colbert analogy.

4. **Technical and Ethical Challenges**:  
   Discussions touch on the difficulty of balancing AI efficiency with accountability. **prfchm** argues AI is a tool, not a replacement for journalistic judgment, while **tdb7893** and **ZeroGravitas** critique cherry-picked data and industry lobbying (e.g., chemical industry greenwashing).

5. **Examples of Investigative Work**:  
   Links to ProPublica’s investigations (healthcare, tax loopholes, 5G policy) underscore their focus on systemic issues. **mkys** highlights their non-partisan track record, covering topics from cybersecurity to civil rights.

In summary, the thread reflects a nuanced debate: skepticism about AI’s role in journalism, admiration for ProPublica’s rigor, and ideological tensions over media objectivity, all while acknowledging the complexity of integrating technology into accountability reporting.

In today's fascinating exploration of the intersection between AI and classic gaming nostalgia, Rich Pelley investigates whether anyone can create a Pac-Man clone using generative AI tools, particularly Elon Musk's Grok chatbot. The results, it seems, are a curious mix of potential and pitfalls.

The journey begins with John Hester, a retired software developer from California, who managed to produce a somewhat recognizable Pac-Man in just a couple of hours, albeit with some shapeshifting quirks. His takeaway? While impressive, AI still requires human guidance to refine and direct the output effectively. 

Next, we meet Justin Martin, aka SuperTrucker, a former truck driver who ambitiously aimed to craft a simple game for his young son. His version, despite being functional, had its share of glitches, prompting a quick pivot to Tetris—a puzzle AI apparently excels at! Justin's experience highlights how AI can democratize game design, though not without its frustrations.

Over in New Jersey, Jimmy, known as 8 Bit, managed to whip up a Pac-Man version in 15 minutes, leveraging an image of the original game to great effect. Despite some inaccuracies, he was thrilled with the expedited process, rating his creation a solid three stars.

Finally, Estonia's Stiven, or OxLnk, offered a lightning-fast attempt with mixed results, shedding light on the potential speed of AI-assisted development, albeit sometimes at the expense of accuracy and detail.

In summary, while Grok offers a tempting glimpse into rapid game development, the process still necessitates a blend of human intervention and iterative improvements to bridge the gap between rudimentary clones and true classics. Whether AI will fully revolutionize this space remains an open question, but for now, it certainly makes for some entertaining experiments.

The discussion around using AI tools to create Pac-Man clones reveals a mix of optimism, practical challenges, and skepticism. Key takeaways include:

### 1. **AI’s Strengths and Limitations**
   - **Speed vs. Accuracy**: Users acknowledge that AI (e.g., Grok, Claude, ChatGPT) accelerates initial coding tasks, especially for repetitive or boilerplate code. However, outputs often require significant human refinement. As one user noted, “AI saves time on repetitive work but struggles with complex logic.”
   - **Context Limitations**: LLMs like Grok sometimes “forget” conversational context, leading to nonsensical or broken code unless users meticulously guide the process or revert to documentation. A developer highlighted the frustration of hours spent “re-prompting” to fix issues.

### 2. **Real-World Experiments**
   - **Java Pac-Man Clone**: A user shared their experience using ChatGPT to build a Java Swing-based Pac-Man clone for a college project. Despite initial struggles with Swing’s complexity, ChatGPT helped rewrite Python examples into Java, reducing development time to 30 hours.
   - **Minesweeper Failures**: Another user tested LLMs on Minesweeper AI, revealing poor performance (winning only 3 out of 50 games), underscoring AI’s difficulties with strategic thinking.

### 3. **Tool Comparisons and Use Cases**
   - **Claude’s Edge**: Users praised Claude for excelling at templating tasks, JSON schema parsing, and reducing boilerplate code. One developer noted it “saved hours” in production workflows.
   - **Grok’s Hype**: Skepticism emerged around Grok’s practicality compared to other tools, with some labeling its Pac-Man output as “silly” or “sponsored content,” hinting at inflated expectations.

### 4. **Human Intervention Remains Critical**
   - **Code Quality**: AI-generated code often lacks maintainability. As one commenter put it, “Non-coders expect magic, but code is messy and requires clean-up.”
   - **Hybrid Workflows**: Developers emphasized blending AI assistance with manual coding for complex projects. For example, translating AI snippets into functional game logic or collision systems still demands human expertise.

### 5. **Skepticism and Humor**
   - Users joked about the Guardian’s “sponsored” article framing Grok favorably, while others critiqued AI’s overhyped role in game development. A recurring theme: AI tools are fun for rapid prototypes but fall short of replacing nuanced, human-driven design.

### Final Note:
While AI democratizes coding and speeds up early-stage work, the consensus is clear: **AI accelerates the process but doesn’t eliminate the need for human creativity, debugging, and architectural oversight**. For now, Pac-Man clones remain a blend of AI-assisted drafting and hands-on refinement.
