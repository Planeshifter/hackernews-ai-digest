### Translation of Rust's core and alloc crates to Coq for formal verification

#### [Submission URL](https://formal.land/blog/2024/04/26/translation-core-alloc-crates) | 353 points | by [p4bl0](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=p4bl0) | [113 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40363744)

Researchers are pushing the boundaries of formal verification for Rust programs with coq-of-rust, a tool translating Rust code into the Coq proof system. By tackling the challenge of handling primitive constructs like Option::unwrap_or_default from Rust's standard library, they've made significant progress. The translation of core and alloc crates, comprising large amounts of complex Rust code, demonstrates their dedication to achieving a "best effort" translation.

Initially encountering compilation issues in the generated Coq code, the team strategized by splitting the output into individual files per input Rust file. This approach not only aids readability and maintenance but also facilitates debugging and parallel compilation. Addressing bugs related to module name collisions, they improved uniqueness by incorporating additional information, resulting in more robust translations.

Despite a small percentage of files that do not compile in Coq, indicating areas for further refinement, the team remains confident in the translated definitions. An example showcasing the translation of the unwrap_or_default method for the Option type illustrates their commitment to accuracy through proof verification.

Looking ahead, the focus shifts to streamlining the proof process for Rust program verification, aiming to simplify steps such as name resolution and type introduction. With a strong foundation in formalization of the standard library, the researchers are poised to enhance the trustworthiness of their approach.

The discussion on the submission about pushing the boundaries of formal verification for Rust programs using coq-of-rust touched upon various aspects. Some users highlighted the challenges and significance of verifying Rust code in Coq for correctness, drawing comparisons with prior work like "David Wheeler's Countering Trusting Trust" and "Ken Thompson's Trusting Trusting attack." Others delved into the process and approaches for verifying Rust code formally, with mentions of projects like CompCert and seL4 for reference.

Additionally, discussions around formalizing Rust at different levels such as Rust MIR level and THIR level were brought up, with suggestions on how to improve formalization by expressing MIR expressions in a preferred representation directly. There were also mentions of handling special primitive constructs in Rust and comparisons to projects like SPARK Ada for verifying code for small devices.

Furthermore, the discussion touched upon the implications of formal verification in real-world applications, such as in the context of cryptocurrency correctness constraints and trustworthiness in code transformations. The conversation also explored the interplay between Rust's type system, the potential for formal verification, and the level of assurance it can provide in ensuring correctness and safety. Lastly, there were considerations about translating Rust code to Coq manually or semi-manually and the implications for formal verification and trustworthiness in the original code.
