### No physics? No problem. AI weather forecasting is already making strides

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/06/as-a-potentially-historic-hurricane-season-looms-can-ai-forecast-models-help/) | 61 points | by [Brajeshwar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar) | [55 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40576804)

In a groundbreaking development, the weather forecasting community is embracing AI technology with open arms. AI models are revolutionizing weather forecasting by leveraging vast amounts of data, particularly from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts' rich ERA5 dataset. This data treasure trove dates back to 1940 and is now being used to train AI models for advanced weather predictions.

The potential of AI in weather forecasting has sparked innovation, with startups like WindBorne Systems working on solutions to gather crucial atmospheric data using advanced weather balloons. These modern balloons can stay airborne for up to 40 days, providing valuable information on temperature, dewpoints, and pressures that improve the accuracy of weather models.

With AI technology rapidly advancing in the field of meteorology, experts like Matthew Chantry from ECMWF believe that machine learning is poised to play a significant role in the future of weather forecasting. Exciting times lie ahead as AI-driven models are reshaping the way we predict and understand the weather, setting the stage for more precise forecasts and better preparedness for natural disasters like hurricanes.
