### Chain-of-thought can hurt performance on tasks where thinking makes humans worse

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333) | 333 points | by [benocodes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benocodes) | [212 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999340)

A new paper titled "Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse" explores the intricacies of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in machine learning models. Authored by Ryan Liu and colleagues, the research investigates scenarios where CoT—often beneficial in enhancing model performance—actually leads to significant performance drops. Drawing parallels from cognitive psychology, the authors highlight tasks like implicit statistical learning and visual recognition, where deliberation may hinder human performance, and surprisingly, similar effects are observed in advanced language models, experiencing up to a 36.3% decline in accuracy compared to their zero-shot counterparts. Their findings suggest that while the cognitive mechanisms of humans and models are not perfectly aligned, understanding when and how thinking negatively affects performance can refine our approach to model prompting and reasoning processes. This insightful intersection of human cognitive behavior with AI evaluation offers a fresh lens on the complexities of prompt choices in machine learning tasks.

The discussion surrounding the paper "Mind Your Step (by Step)" delves into the implications of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in machine learning, revealing it may actually hinder performance in specific tasks. Participants express a mix of skepticism and curiosity, debating the cognitive analogies between human reasoning and AI language models (LLMs).

Key points of contention revolve around whether LLMs' token prediction capabilities accurately reflect human-like reasoning processes. Some commenters argue that LLMs simply manipulate text based on statistical patterns, lacking genuine understanding, while others believe LLMs display advanced and emergent behavior akin to human cognition under certain conditions.

Several comments explore the idea that overthinking, or positional clarity in prompting, may confuse both humans and models in complex scenarios, echoing the paper's findings. Participants express curiosity about implications for designing better prompting strategies for LLMs, especially in high-stakes situations where precision is critical.

Amidst this, some voices suggest that reducing the reliance on CoT in prompt design could potentially enhance model performance, as excessive deliberation may lead to errors—not just in AI but also in human reasoning. Overall, the discussion illustrates a broader concern within the AI research community about reconciling LLM capabilities with human cognitive processes, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in model deployment and the continuing exploration of AI's relationship with human intelligence.

The document details AFRICOM's rationale for circumventing the typical contracting process, seeking immediate access to Microsoft’s Azure cloud services, which encompass OpenAI’s tools for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This strategic move highlights the increasing reliance of the Pentagon on cloud computing and AI technologies to process vast data and improve decision-making capabilities.

Despite OpenAI's mission to benefit humanity, concerns are being raised about the implications of its tools in a military context. Experts warn about the risks of utilizing AI technologies in high-stakes environments, citing issues with accuracy and reliability of outputs from such systems. The situation underscores a complex intersection of technology, military strategy, and ethical considerations, as the U.S. military looks to harness cutting-edge solutions for operational efficiency.

The discussion around AFRICOM's interest in acquiring OpenAI's technology for military applications sparked a variety of responses. Participants expressed various viewpoints regarding the implications of integrating AI systems into military operations.

1. **Concerns Over Military Use**: Many commenters highlighted ethical concerns regarding the use of AI in military contexts, debating the potential for significant consequences, including the accuracy and reliability of AI outputs in high-stakes situations. The prospect of AI in warfare prompts fears about unintended outcomes and the moral ramifications of such integrations.

2. **Support for AI in Military**: Some participants acknowledged the necessity of advanced technologies within military operations to enhance efficiency and decision-making. This perspective frames the use of AI as a critical advancement in modern warfare, potentially benefiting strategic military objectives.

3. **Skepticism Towards AI Capabilities**: Several comments illustrated skepticism about AI’s current capabilities, particularly in decision-making roles. There were warnings that relying on AI could lead to hallucinated data or misinterpretations, which could compromise critical military decisions.

4. **Link to Broader Military-Industrial Complex**: The conversation touched upon the relationship between tech companies like OpenAI and the military-industrial complex, reflecting on the implications of this link for both technology development and ethical standards.

5. **Mixed Reactions to OpenAI’s Shift**: OpenAI's change in policy to allow military applications raised mixed feelings among commenters. Some praised the technological progress while others critiqued the company's alignment with military interests, questioning if this divergence from its original mission could have detrimental effects.

Overall, the discussion encapsulated a range of opinions, from cautious support for AI advancements in military applications to serious concerns about the ethical implications and potential consequences associated with such a partnership.
