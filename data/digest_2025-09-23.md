### MLB approves robot umpires for 2026 as part of challenge system

#### [Submission URL](https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/46357017/mlb-approves-robot-umpires-2026-part-challenge-system) | 48 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45354304)

Robot umps are coming to MLB in 2026 — but only on demand.

- MLB approved an automated ball-strike (ABS) challenge system: hitters, pitchers, or catchers can tap their head to challenge a call; successful challenges are retained. Each team gets two per game.
- Extra-innings logic: teams get one extra challenge in the 10th; if you run out in the 10th, you automatically get another in the 11th (and so on).
- Tech specs: 12 cameras per park track pitches with ~1/6-inch error. The strike zone is a 2D plane over the plate (17"), scaled to each player: top at 53.5% of height, bottom at 27%.
- Spring training results: about four combined challenges per game with a 52.2% success rate (catchers 56%, hitters 50%, pitchers 41%).
- Context: Umpires are ~94% accurate today; over 60% of ejections involve balls/strikes. The hybrid approach keeps umps calling the game but adds a quick backstop for misses. Catcher framing value could dip.
- The vote wasn’t unanimous among players, but owners’ majority carried it through.

Why it matters: MLB chose a human-first, tech-assisted workflow over full automation—minimizing delays while standardizing the zone with computer vision and a clear, fan-visible review.

The discussion around MLB's 2026 robot ump plan reveals mixed reactions and key debates:

1. **Tradition vs. Technology**:  
   - Some users lament the loss of baseball's "human element," arguing that umpire mistakes and disputes (e.g., ejections, fan reactions) are ingrained in the sport’s charm. Others counter that glaring errors undermine fairness, especially with modern tech (e.g., 8K slow-mo replays) exposing umpire inaccuracies.  
   - Comparisons to cricket’s **DRS system** (in use for 15+ years) show support for limited challenges but skepticism about full automation.

2. **Sports Betting Influence**:  
   - Many tie the changes to the rise of legalized sports betting (post-2018), suggesting leagues now prioritize precision to protect betting integrity. References to scandals like the **Black Sox** and **Tim Donaghy** (NBA) highlight fears of corruption, though some dismiss this as overblown.

3. **Strategic Implications**:  
   - Questions arise about how teams will strategize challenges (e.g., saving them for high-stakes moments) and whether catcher framing skills will become obsolete.  
   - Technical critiques target the strike zone’s height parameters (53.5% vs. 27%), with confusion over how it adapts to player stances.

4. **Cultural Nostalgia**:  
   - Users reminisce about iconic umpire meltdowns (e.g., Lou Piniella) and argue that "bad calls" are part of baseball’s lore. However, younger fans accustomed to instant replay demand accountability.  

5. **Skepticism and Hope**:  
   - While some praise the hybrid system for balancing human judgment and tech, others doubt it will curb corruption or satisfy purists. A recurring joke about **Angel Hernandez**—a notoriously controversial umpire—underscores frustration with current officiating.  

**Takeaway**: The plan is seen as a cautious step toward modernization, appeasing accuracy advocates without fully abandoning baseball’s traditional "human drama." However, debates over betting’s role, implementation quirks, and the sport’s soul remain unresolved.

### Getting AI to work in complex codebases

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/humanlayer/advanced-context-engineering-for-coding-agents/blob/main/ace-fca.md) | 244 points | by [dhorthy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dhorthy) | [232 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45347532)

Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents (GitHub)

What it is
- A focused playbook and reference implementation for getting better results from code-writing LLMs by feeding them the right slices of a large codebase. It treats “context” as a first-class layer: how to select, compress, and stage the materials an agent sees before it edits.

Why it matters
- Coding agents fail less from model limits than from bad inputs: wrong files, missing symbols, sprawling diffs, and bloated prompts. With smarter context assembly, you can boost reliability, reduce destructive edits, and make smaller/cheaper models perform far better on real repos.

What’s inside
- Patterns and prompts for repo-scale tasks: spec-first instructions, plan → edit loops, diff-based conversations, and error-triage prompts.
- Code-aware retrieval beyond embeddings top‑k: symbol/AST and call-graph–driven file selection, “dependency cone” expansion, recent-edit locality, and test-guided scoping.
- Compression and scaffolding: inline summaries, interface stubs, breadcrumb comments, and constraint checklists to keep the model anchored.
- A modular “context builder” you can drop into agents/IDEs to assemble task-aware bundles (spec, plan, relevant code, tests, diffs) before each action.
- Example workflows and comparisons against naive retrieval on common repo tasks (bug fixes, small features, refactors).

Who it’s for
- Builders of IDE copilots, code-review bots, and repo assistants who need better retrieval/ranking and prompt orchestration without reinventing a full agent stack.

Key takeaways
- Treat context as a pipeline: clarify task → find the minimal working set → scaffold and compress → iterate with diffs and tests.
- Prefer symbol- and dependency-level retrieval to file-level embeddings alone.
- Use tests and recent edits to bound scope; keep the agent’s “working set” stable across steps.
- Smaller models can punch above their weight when context is engineered well.

Early repo, growing interest; discussion centers on LSP/AST integration, eval methods on monorepos, and how far context quality can stretch current models before you need heavier agents.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The discussion around the GitHub project on Advanced Context Engineering for Coding Agents highlights several key points and debates:

### 1. **Handling Large Codebases**  
   - Participants emphasized the difficulty of using LLMs to manage large, complex codebases, especially in tracking architectural decisions and dependencies.  
   - **Key Challenge**: Ensuring LLMs process the *right* context to avoid errors in refactoring or feature implementation (e.g., "dependency cone" strategies).  

### 2. **Code Quality vs. Quantity**  
   - Skepticism arose around metrics like **35K lines of code (LOC) written in 7 hours**, with questions about whether this represents meaningful progress or merely "playground" experimentation.  
   - Some argued smaller, well-abstracted, testable code (~1K LOC/day) is more valuable than bloated AI-generated code.  

### 3. **Abstraction vs. Delegation**  
   - Debate centered on AI's role in abstraction: Can agents reliably generate stable abstractions, or do they risk propagating Sandi Metz’s "[wrong abstraction](https://sandimetz.com/blog/2016/1/20/the-wrong-abstraction)" problem?  
   - Success stories included AI-assisted management of **300K LOC Rust codebases**, but concerns persisted about human oversight and code review.  

### 4. **Workflow Shifts**  
   - Participants shared experiences with **AI-driven "vibes-based coding"** (iterative, intuition-guided development) replacing traditional planning. Some praised its speed, while others warned of unstable results.  
   - Tools like Claude Code were noted for enabling **rapid prototyping** but also raising questions about code ownership and maintainability.  

### 5. **Human-AI Collaboration**  
   - Strong consensus emerged on the need for **human oversight**: AI-generated code requires rigorous review, especially for business logic and security.  
   - The term "AI-assisted programming" sparked debate: Is it genuine programming, or just tool-assisted code generation? Some feared over-reliance could erode developers’ system understanding.  

### 6. **Emotional Impact**  
   - Mixed feelings surfaced: AI tools boosted productivity but risked burnout due to constant context-switching and pressure to deliver.  
   - Anecdotes highlighted improved job satisfaction when AI handled repetitive tasks, freeing developers for creative work.  

### 7. **Future Directions**  
   - Interest in **spec-driven development** (e.g., using UML diagrams or structured prompts to guide AI) and tighter IDE integration.  
   - Questions remained about evaluating these techniques in monorepos and scaling them to enterprise-level projects.  

**Key Takeaway**: While AI tools like Claude Code offer significant productivity gains, their success hinges on **context engineering**, human oversight, and balancing abstraction with pragmatic code quality. The community remains cautiously optimistic but wary of overestimating current capabilities.

### Context Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons

#### [Submission URL](https://manus.im/blog/Context-Engineering-for-AI-Agents-Lessons-from-Building-Manus) | 43 points | by [helloericsf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=helloericsf) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45352901)

Context Engineering for AI Agents: Lessons from Building Manus

Manus chose context engineering over end-to-end model fine-tuning to ship faster, stay model-agnostic, and ride model improvements. After four rebuilds of their agent framework—an iterative grind they dub “Stochastic Graduate Descent”—they’ve converged on a few hard-won principles.

Key ideas:
- Design around the KV-cache: For agents, prefill dominates (often ~100:1 input-to-output tokens). KV-cache hit rate is the most important production metric for latency and cost (Claude Sonnet cached input: ~$0.30/MTok vs ~$3/MTok uncached).
- Make cache hits easy:
  - Keep the prompt prefix stable (no timestamps or drifting headers).
  - Treat context as append-only; serialize deterministically (watch JSON key order).
  - Insert explicit cache breakpoints where required; ensure at least the full system prompt is cached.
  - If self-hosting (e.g., vLLM), enable prefix/prompt caching and use session IDs for sticky routing.
- Mask, don’t remove (tools): As action spaces balloon (think MCP and user-added tools), don’t dynamically add/remove tools mid-run.
  - Why: tool lists live near the front of context, so changes nuke cache; prior steps may reference now-missing tools, causing schema errors and hallucinations.
  - Instead: keep a stable tool set and mask or constrain selection so the model picks from the right subset without breaking cache.

Takeaway for builders: Treat context as a first-class surface. Prioritize cacheability, determinism, and stable interfaces; use masking and constrained decoding to manage complexity without blowing up cost, latency, or reliability.

The discussion highlights practical considerations and strategies for developing AI agents, focusing on code maintenance, memory management, and pricing models:

1. **Code Maintenance Philosophy**  
   - Avoid over-engineering: Prioritize stability over perfection ("Don't delete tools/bloat, don't refactor prematurely").  
   - Preserve context: Keep historical comments/artifacts and use PR-based workflows for traceability.  
   - Reduce redundancy: Eliminate repetitive "magic patterns" in prompts/tooling.

2. **Structured Memory Architecture**  
   - Adopt file system-based memory over backend databases for simplicity.  
   - Organize with directory hierarchies and meaningful naming conventions (e.g., `gnttsk-clnp-codeDONE`, category prefixes, subdirectories).  
   - Use standardized templates for plans/findings and integrate with tools like version control graphs or regex searches.  
   - Subcomment recommends simplifying toolchains (e.g., basic `update_plan` progress tracking with OpenAI Codex).

3. **Business Model Implications**  
   - Fixed pricing plans incentivize caching optimizations, improving margins.  
   - Metered/usage-based plans risk user friction and require careful caching viability analysis.  
   - Beginners should prioritize cache-aware architectures from the start.

The thread emphasizes balancing technical pragmatism (stable interfaces, structured memory) with economic considerations (caching-driven pricing strategies) in AI agent development.

### From MCP to shell: MCP auth flaws enable RCE in Claude Code, Gemini CLI and more

#### [Submission URL](https://verialabs.com/blog/from-mcp-to-shell/) | 119 points | by [stuxf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stuxf) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45348183)

Headline: From MCP to shell — OAuth URL trust bug lets malicious MCP servers pop RCE in popular AI dev tools

What’s new
Veria Labs shows how a subtle flaw in the Model Context Protocol’s new OAuth flow can be chained to remote code execution in multiple MCP clients, including Cloudflare’s use-mcp library, Anthropic’s MCP Inspector, Claude Code, and Google’s Gemini CLI. They demo “popping calc” as proof of RCE.

The core bug
- MCP servers tell clients where to send users for OAuth. Many clients didn’t validate that URL.
- A malicious server can return an arbitrary URL (e.g., javascript: or a hostile domain).
- Example: use-mcp called window.open on a server-supplied string, enabling XSS via javascript: and opener hijack.
- With MCP Inspector and stdio transport, the XSS can be escalated to local command execution, completing the chain: Evil MCP → crafted auth URL → client opens it → code runs → RCE.

Who’s affected
- Cloudflare’s use-mcp (widely used on npm)
- Anthropic’s MCP Inspector and Claude Code
- Google’s Gemini CLI
- “Almost” ChatGPT; existing defenses reportedly blocked exploitation
- Authors note other vendors were probed as well

Why it matters
This is a classic OAuth trust/redirect pitfall now landing in AI tooling, where connecting to arbitrary “tools” (MCP servers) is normal. It turns a server you chat with into a vehicle for local code execution.

Mitigations
- Clients: Strictly validate/allowlist auth URLs; reject non-HTTPS and javascript:; use noopener; sandbox popups; require user confirmation; harden/disable dangerous stdio actions by default.
- Users: Update affected tools, avoid untrusted MCP servers, run dev tools with least privilege.

Status
The post outlines vendor responses and fixes and highlights that the most impactful fix is enforcing strict URL validation in the OAuth flow plus tightening stdio transport behavior.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around a critical OAuth vulnerability in MCP clients that allows malicious servers to trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE). Key themes and arguments include:

1. **Supply Chain Risks Analogy**:  
   - Commenters liken trusting arbitrary MCP servers to installing untrusted PyPI/npm packages or VSCode extensions. The risk is inherent in systems that execute third-party code without strict vetting.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to "supply chain attacks," where compromised tools or dependencies lead to system-wide breaches.  

2. **Protocol Design Criticism**:  
   - Critics argue that MCP’s design flaws (e.g., improper URL validation, lack of sandboxing) reflect poor security practices. The protocol’s novelty is questioned, with some noting it merely wraps existing technologies like JSON-RPC without addressing inherent risks.  
   - Others defend MCP as transformative but acknowledge its early-stage risks, comparing it to pioneering technologies like the Wright Flyer—revolutionary but initially unsafe.  

3. **Severity of Client Vulnerabilities**:  
   - Debate arises over whether MCP clients should be as vulnerable as web browsers. Some argue that tools like Claude Code or Gemini CLI, which execute local commands, must enforce stricter security than browsers (e.g., blocking `javascript:` URLs by default).  
   - Concerns highlight how malware delivery via "trusted" services (e.g., OAuth logins) complicates detection, blurring lines between legitimate use and phishing.  

4. **AI-Specific Challenges**:  
   - Broader worries emerge about AI tools’ ability to distinguish trusted commands from malicious inputs. Prompt injection and LLM interpretation of third-party data are seen as fundamentally unsolved problems.  
   - Suggestions include stricter input sanitization, deterministic command structures, or dedicated "sandboxed" LLMs to handle untrusted data.  

5. **Mitigation and Responsibility**:  
   - Vendors are urged to enforce HTTPS-only URLs, sandbox popups, and disable dangerous stdio actions by default. Users are advised to update tools and avoid untrusted MCP servers.  
   - Skepticism exists about relying solely on vendors, with calls for community-driven improvements to MCP’s documentation and security practices.  

**Notable Quotes**:  
- *"MCP servers are like npm packages—installing them grants arbitrary code execution. The risk is expected but needs mitigation."*  
- *"AI tools’ ‘magic’ obscures their attack surface. Supply chain risks are now amplified by AI’s hype-driven adoption."*  
- *"This isn’t novel—just another OAuth pitfall in a new wrapper. Fixable, but highlights lazy engineering."*  

**Conclusion**:  
The discussion underscores systemic issues in securing AI tooling and protocols like MCP. While technical fixes exist (e.g., strict URL validation), broader concerns about AI’s trust model and rapid development practices remain unresolved. The incident serves as a cautionary tale for balancing innovation with security in emerging technologies.

### Sampling and structured outputs in LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://parthsareen.com/blog.html#sampling.md) | 203 points | by [SamLeBarbare](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SamLeBarbare) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45345207)

I’m missing the submission details. Please share:
- Link to the Hacker News post (and, if different, the article link), or paste the text
- Whether to summarize the article, the HN discussion, or both
- Target length (e.g., 2–3 paragraphs, 5 bullets)
- Any angle or audience preference (e.g., technical, executive)

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the **Guidance library** for structured LLM outputs:

---

### **Key Discussion Points**  
1. **Guidance Overview**  
   - Guidance is a high-performance library (written in Rust) for enforcing structured outputs (e.g., JSON, custom grammars) during LLM inference.  
   - Supports multiple backends: Hugging Face Transformers, vLLM, llama.cpp, and OpenAI’s structured endpoints.  
   - Focuses on **constraint-based generation** (e.g., masking invalid tokens) to ensure outputs adhere to predefined formats, improving reliability.  

2. **Technical Insights & Use Cases**  
   - **Token Masking**: Users highlight Guidance’s efficiency in parallel token masking (via CPU) to speed up constrained generation, reducing GPU wait times.  
   - **JSON vs. Custom Grammars**: While JSON is widely supported, custom grammars (e.g., XML, DSLs) offer flexibility but require complex implementation. Models like GPT-4 struggle with non-JSON grammars, necessitating careful debugging.  
   - **Real-World Applications**:  
     - Writing assistance (e.g., managing book chapters, character summaries via RAG).  
     - Integration with tools like Pydantic for schema validation.  
     - Enterprise use cases (e.g., NL-to-SQL, data pipelines).  

3. **Comparisons & Ecosystem**  
   - **Pydantic**: Contrasted for schema validation but lacks Guidance’s real-time constraint enforcement during generation.  
   - **Google Gemini**: Praised for its `propertyOrdering` feature in JSON schema enforcement, though not as flexible as Guidance’s grammar-based approach.  
   - **Performance Benchmarks**: Users cite [research](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10868v3) showing Guidance’s speed and accuracy advantages over other structured-output providers.  

---

### **Challenges & Community Feedback**  
- **Complexity**: Custom grammars (e.g., XML) require significant effort to design and debug, though tools like Earley parsers help.  
- **Model Limitations**: Even with constraints, perfect structured output isn’t guaranteed; downstream QA checks remain critical.  
- **Adoption Hurdles**: Developers urge better documentation and community examples for non-JSON use cases.  

### **Broader Implications**  
The discussion reflects growing interest in **structured LLM outputs** for reliability-critical applications. While JSON remains dominant, tools like Guidance and Gemini signal a shift toward more flexible, domain-specific grammars. Community momentum focuses on improving tooling and expanding beyond JSON-centric workflows.  

---  
**TL;DR**: Guidance enables efficient, constraint-based LLM outputs, but adoption of custom grammars requires effort. JSON is reliable but limiting; the ecosystem is evolving toward more flexible structured generation.

### Android users can now use conversational editing in Google Photos

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/products/photos/android-conversational-editing-google-photos/) | 119 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45349848)

Google is rolling out Google Photos’ conversational editing—first seen on Pixel 10—to all eligible Android users in the U.S. Tap “Help me edit,” describe changes via voice or text, and Gemini handles the adjustments, with quick-start prompts like “make it better.” The tool also supports playful, generative edits (e.g., moving an alpaca from a petting zoo to Waikiki) alongside one‑tap suggestions and gesture-based tweaks. Availability is U.S.-only for now and limited to eligible Android devices.

The Hacker News discussion about Google Photos’ new AI-powered conversational editing features reveals mixed reactions and broader critiques of AI integration:

1. **Criticism of Forced AI Features**:  
   - Users express frustration with AI tools feeling intrusive and bloated, likening them to "bloatware" that disrupts workflows. Comparisons are drawn to Microsoft’s Clippy and poorly integrated AI widgets (e.g., Lowe’s website), highlighting a trend of rushed, gimmicky implementations.  
   - Some argue AI features prioritize investor appeal over user needs, with one commenter noting, *"AI gives many investors a hard-on."*

2. **Missing Functionality**:  
   - Longstanding tools like perspective correction and document scanning are reportedly buried or removed, frustrating users who rely on practical edits over generative "playful" tweaks.  

3. **Storage Monetization Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism arises around Google’s motives, with users speculating that AI-generated image versions (e.g., adding landmarks to photos) could inflate storage usage, pushing upgrades to paid plans. While marginal per user, the collective impact across millions could drive significant revenue.  

4. **Alternatives and Self-Hosting**:  
   - **Nextcloud Memories** and **Immich** are praised for privacy and self-hosting, though Immich lacks HDR support.  
   - **Ente** is recommended for its encryption and affordability.  
   - Technical users discuss self-hosting challenges, debating tools like **Tailscale**/**WireGuard** for secure access and **Hetzner VPS** for storage, though hardware reliability and encryption remain concerns.  

5. **UI/UX Complaints**:  
   - Recent Google Photos updates are criticized for cluttered interfaces, hidden settings, and reduced functionality, with one user quipping, *"The latest Android update made fonts rounder—because that’s what we needed."*  

In summary, while some welcome AI experimentation, many users perceive Google’s approach as prioritizing novelty and revenue over usability, driving interest in alternatives that offer control and simplicity.

### Agents turn simple keyword search into compelling search experiences

#### [Submission URL](https://softwaredoug.com/blog/2025/09/22/reasoning-agents-need-bad-search) | 59 points | by [softwaredoug](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=softwaredoug) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45347363)

Agents turn simple keyword search into compelling search experiences

- Core idea: Thick, feature-heavy search APIs (query understanding, reranking, synonyms) are great for humans but too opaque for agents. A “dumb,” predictable tool is better for agent reasoning.
- Approach: Expose a minimal BM25 keyword search (no synonyms, simple tokenization) with a clear docstring the agent can model. Let the agent iterate queries like a human—try, observe, refine.
- Mechanisms: After each tool call, the agent self-evaluates results (LLM-as-judge), saves user_query, tool_query, quality, and reasoning, and consults a semantic cache of past, similar queries before searching again.
- Examples: For “a couch fit for a vampire,” the agent surfaced velvet/chesterfield and chaise options; for “ugliest chair,” it tested expansions like “cow print chair,” “patchwork accent chair,” ranked outcomes, and learned which terms worked.
- Trade-offs and upside: It’s slower, but surprisingly effective. The learned query expansions can later improve conventional site search without LLMs.
- Takeaway: For agentic search, make tools simple and predictable; let the agent supply the intelligence.

The discussion around simplifying search tools for AI agents reveals several key insights and debates:

### **Support for Simplicity**
- **Predictable Tools**: Many agree that "dumb," transparent APIs (e.g., BM25 keyword search) allow agents to reason more effectively by avoiding opaque ranking logic. This aligns with the submission’s argument that agents thrive on simplicity, enabling iterative query refinement akin to human behavior.
- **Structured Outputs**: Structured results (e.g., filtered lists, clear tokenization) help agents parse information without being overwhelmed by complex search engine features like synonyms or popularity signals.

### **Criticism of Modern Search Engines**
- **Ad-Driven Results**: Users criticize platforms like Google for prioritizing ads and SEO-optimized content over relevance, making it harder to find precise information. Suggestions to skip sponsored links or rely on niche tools (e.g., Stack Overflow for programming) highlight frustration with commercialized search.
- **Complexity vs. Effectiveness**: While Google’s evolution (PageRank → conversational keyword handling) improved user experience, its heavy ranking algorithms and susceptibility to spam complicate agent-based reasoning. Some argue simpler systems avoid these pitfalls.

### **Trade-offs and Challenges**
- **Cost and Speed**: Agents’ iterative querying is slower and potentially expensive, especially with LLM involvement. However, proponents argue the trade-off is justified by improved precision and the ability to repurpose learned query expansions.
- **Agent Reasoning Skepticism**: Critics question agents’ ability to make "valid judgments," labeling their reasoning as "recursive BS." Others counter that agents need functional tools (e.g., GPT-4, Claude) rather than complex search APIs to excel.

### **Innovation and Alternatives**
- **Synthetic Feedback**: Proposals include using synthetic clickstream data to adjust queries dynamically, mimicking human refinement without manual input.
- **Domain-Specific APIs**: Tailored tools (e.g., Postgres for structured data) are praised for precision, contrasting with Google’s broad, popularity-driven approach.

### **Humorous Takes**
- The term "thick-daddy search API" humorously critiques over-engineered solutions, underscoring the preference for minimalism.

### **Conclusion**
The consensus leans toward empowering agents with simple, interpretable tools while acknowledging challenges in cost, speed, and reasoning reliability. Critics remain wary of overhyping agent capabilities, but proponents see potential in combining transparency with LLM adaptability.

### Abundant Intelligence

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.samaltman.com/abundant-intelligence) | 82 points | by [j4mie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=j4mie) | [123 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45346968)

Sam Altman proposes a “gigawatt-per-week” AI infrastructure factory

- Altman says AI demand is exploding and access to AI could become a fundamental economic driver—and even a human right.
- He argues compute is the binding constraint: with enough power (he floats “10 gigawatts”), AI might crack problems like curing cancer or delivering personalized tutoring to every student.
- Goal: build a factory capable of producing 1 GW of new AI infrastructure every week—requiring breakthroughs across chips, power, buildings, and robotics.
- Emphasis on building much of it in the US to accelerate domestic capacity in chips and energy, areas where other countries are moving faster.
- Details on partners will roll out in the coming months; financing plans later this year, with Altman hinting at novel models since “increasing compute is the literal key to increasing revenue.”

Why it matters
- Scale: 1 GW/week implies tens of gigawatts per year—on par with the entire current global data center power footprint, signaling a step-change in AI buildout.
- Industrial shift: Frames AI not just as software, but as an energy-and-manufacturing endeavor akin to gigafactories.
- Policy and grid implications: Success hinges on permitting, power generation (likely nuclear/renewables), transmission, chips (HBM, advanced packaging), and cooling.

Open questions
- Where will the power come from, and how fast can interconnects be secured?
- Can chip supply, packaging, and memory scale to match the proposed pace?
- What “interesting” financing could underwrite infrastructure at this magnitude—and who are the partners?

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Sam Altman's AI Infrastructure Proposal**

1. **Environmental & Energy Concerns**  
   - Critics highlight the immense energy demands (10 GW/week), equating to ~87 TWh annually (2% of U.S. consumption), which would require unprecedented scaling of renewables/nuclear. Sam Altman’s investment in Oklo (nuclear) is noted, but feasibility is doubted without policy shifts.  

2. **Skepticism Toward Feasibility & Hype**  
   - Many question the practicality of scaling to 10 GW/week, comparing it to existing infrastructure (e.g., Colossus supercomputer’s 150 MW). Others dismiss AI as a “magic solution” for climate change or cancer, arguing incremental model improvements (GPT-3 to GPT-4) don’t justify hype around GPT-5.  

3. **AI as a "Human Right" Debate**  
   - Critics reject framing AI access as a fundamental right, comparing it to privatized utilities (e.g., bottled water). Some argue governments, not corporations, should provide equitable access. Concerns about neocolonialism arise, with fears that Global North-dominated AI could exploit poorer regions.  

4. **Technical & Industrial Challenges**  
   - Scaling chip fabrication, power grids, and cooling systems is seen as a major hurdle. Partnerships (e.g., Nvidia, TSMC) and U.S. manufacturing are discussed, but supply chain limitations (HBM memory, advanced packaging) could stall progress.  

5. **Economic & Market Dynamics**  
   - Defenders note AI’s transformative potential (e.g., Nvidia’s $100B valuation), while skeptics call it overhyped. Financing models for gigawatt-scale infrastructure remain unclear, with doubts about profitability despite OpenAI’s revenue claims.  

6. **Ethical & Political Implications**  
   - Concerns include privatization of foundational technology, labor conditions in chip factories, and whether AGI development distracts from tangible climate solutions. Some critique Altman’s rhetoric as overly optimistic or detached from technical realities.  

**Key Takeaways**  
The discussion reflects polarized views: enthusiasm for AI’s potential clashes with skepticism about its scalability, environmental impact, and ethical governance. While Altman’s vision is seen as ambitious, commenters demand clearer technical, financial, and policy roadmaps to address energy, equity, and industrial challenges.

Google Cloud’s 2025 DORA report says AI has gone from novelty to default in software development, with broad productivity gains but uneven trust and mixed org-level outcomes.

Key points:
- Adoption is near-universal: 90% of ~5,000 tech pros now use AI in their workflows (up 14 points YoY), spending a median of 2 hours/day with it.
- Reliance is deepening: 65% report at least moderate reliance on AI (37% moderate, 20% a lot, 8% a great deal).
- Productivity and quality: 80%+ say AI boosts productivity; 59% see improved code quality.
- Trust paradox: Only 24% have high trust (4% “great deal,” 20% “a lot”), while 30% trust AI “a little” or “not at all.” People find AI useful even if they don’t fully trust it—more copilot than autopilot.
- Team/organizational impact: AI adoption now correlates with higher software delivery throughput (a reversal from last year), but ensuring software “works as intended” before release remains a pain point.
- “Mirror and multiplier”: In cohesive orgs, AI amplifies efficiency; in fragmented ones, it exposes weaknesses. The report outlines seven team archetypes (e.g., “Harmonious high‑achievers” vs. “Legacy bottleneck”) to explain why outcomes differ.
- New blueprint: DORA introduces an AI Capabilities Model—seven technical and cultural capabilities meant to help orgs turn adoption into durable performance gains.

Takeaway: AI is already changing how code gets shipped. The biggest wins come when teams pair the tools with strong culture, processes, and systems—not just usage.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Google's DORA AI Report:**  

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism about AI's role in software development, aligning with the report's findings of high adoption but uneven trust. Key themes:  

### 1. **Adoption vs. Trust**  
- **Broad usage**: Developers acknowledge AI’s prevalence (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Claude, ChatGPT) for tasks like boilerplate code, debugging, and documentation.  
- **Low trust**: Many question AI’s reliability, with anecdotes of AI-generated code introducing subtle bugs or security flaws (e.g., incorrect Kubernetes configurations, null terminator issues). A user highlights a merge request review where AI suggested a flawed solution, leading to production risks.  

### 2. **Productivity vs. Quality**  
- **Speed vs. substance**: While AI speeds up repetitive tasks (e.g., API integrations, CLI commands), developers warn it can lead to superficial solutions. One commenter notes, *"AI is a sharp knife—we’re regretting mass offshoring in the 2000s, and might regret this too."*  
- **Debugging debt**: AI’s ability to generate code often outpaces its capacity to explain or debug it, creating maintenance challenges.  

### 3. **Skill Erosion and Education**  
- **Junior developers**: Concerns that over-reliance on AI tools discourages deep understanding. *"Students blindly copy-paste Stack Overflow answers generated by LLMs,"* says one user, fearing this erodes problem-solving skills.  
- **Code review challenges**: Managers report spending excessive time fixing AI-generated code from juniors, calling it a *"social media problem"* where metrics prioritize speed over quality.  

### 4. **Organizational Impact**  
- **Management disconnect**: Developers criticize leadership for pushing AI (e.g., *"drinking the Kool-Aid"*) without grasping its limitations. Tools like Copilot are seen as productivity theater.  
- **Cultural multipliers**: Strong teams benefit from AI, but fragmented teams see exacerbated weaknesses (e.g., *"Legacy bottlenecks"*).  

### 5. **Ethical and Economic Concerns**  
- **Surveillance and profit motives**: Some argue AI adoption prioritizes corporate profit over user value, with fears of a *"cyberpunk future"* dominated by low-quality, AI-generated code.  
- **Employment anxiety**: Developers worry AI could replicate the offshoring crisis, with junior roles being automated or outsourced to LLMs.  

### Notable Quotes:  
- *"AI creates nice-looking code that works until it doesn’t—then nobody understands why."*  
- *"Trust is like a flamethrower in a kindergarten: useful until it’s not."*  
- *"We’re glimpsing a flat industrial revolution—machines replacing builders, not just laborers."*  

**Takeaway**: While AI is entrenched in workflows, its value hinges on **responsible adoption**—pairing tools with robust processes, mentorship, and critical thinking. Developers stress that AI should augment, not replace, human expertise.

### The AI Kids Take San Francisco

HN Top Story: Inside SF’s new AI “hacker hotels” — ascetic, always-on, and a little culty

TL;DR: A New York Magazine feature drops into Accelr8, a hacker house carved out of a one-star hotel near the Tenderloin, capturing a new SF wave of 18–28-year-old AI founders living cheaply, working obsessively, and treating social capital as the real currency. Think gold rush energy meets church-camp fervor, with privacy-logging wearables and casual talk of P(doom).

What’s new
- Accelr8: Founder Patrick Santiago (28) leased dozens of grim hotel rooms to create a “summer-camp” for AI builders. Thin margins, but high “social capital”; food and a room traded for network density.
- The vibe: Shoes off, work/life erased, beer untouched at parties; energy drinks and chicken instead. Residents disdain B2B SaaS, want “hard problems,” track time rigorously, and sometimes get hired by AI agents.
- Always recording: Santiago wears a Buddi device that records and summarizes conversations—raising obvious consent and privacy questions inside cramped communal living.
- Gold rush framing: Jeff “Professor Dumpster” Wilson (ex-academic who once lived in a dumpster) compares it to 1849—young, hungry arrivals building kingdoms with nowhere to sleep. His line: “They’re creating the God.”
- Generational shift: Compared with the dot-com cohort, this scene skews younger, more ascetic, and more comfortable joking about existential risk (“P(doom)”) while sprinting to ship.

Why it matters
- The accelerator is the house: These setups blur accelerator, hostel, and cult-of-focus—an efficient way to concentrate talent and momentum outside traditional VC programs.
- Cultural tell: AI’s center of gravity isn’t big-tech salaries; it’s scrappy founder stacks, agentic hiring, and “raise by building in public” social loops.
- Friction points: Recording-by-default devices, safety trade-offs in low-cost housing, and a scene that mixes world-saving rhetoric with world-ending probabilities—catnip and concern for regulators, neighbors, and investors alike.

Discussion angles for HN
- Are hacker houses the new default accelerator for AI-native startups?
- Ethics of ambient recording in communal work/living spaces.
- Does ascetic intensity produce better companies—or selection effects and burnout?
- Is this sustainable beyond the current AI funding cycle?

The brief discussion reflects mixed reactions to the New York Magazine article and the hacker hotel phenomenon:  

1. **Critique of journalism style**: User "rndycprtn" accuses NY Mag of prioritizing trendy, culture-focused narratives over substantive reporting, comparing the piece to past NY Mag articles about topics like NYC’s West Village "cool kids" and college cheating scandals. They argue the article sensationalizes the AI hacker house scene as a lifestyle trend rather than critically engaging with its substance.  

2. **Negative judgment**: User "smcg" dismisses the scene with a blunt “They’re tacky,” suggesting skepticism about the hacker house ethos or its portrayal.  

3. **Reference link**: User "ChrisArchitect" shares an archived link (likely to the original article or related material), adding no further commentary.  

**Takeaway**: The comments highlight skepticism toward the article’s framing and the hacker house culture itself, with critics viewing it as superficial or emblematic of media hype cycles.
