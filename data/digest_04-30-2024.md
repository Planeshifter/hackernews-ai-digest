### RISC-V support in Android just got a big setback

#### [Submission URL](https://www.androidauthority.com/android-drop-risc-v-kernel-3438330/) | 97 points | by [ammo1662](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ammo1662) | [73 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40206729)

In a surprising turn of events, Google has announced a setback in its support for the RISC-V architecture within the Android Common Kernel. RISC-V, an open-source architecture gaining traction in the hardware industry, was set to receive Android compatibility, but recent patches indicate a removal of this support.

Google's efforts to integrate RISC-V into Android were seen as a significant step towards enabling devices with RISC-V chipsets to run certified Android builds. However, the removal of RISC-V support in the Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI) suggests a delay in this progression.

While there is confirmation from Google that RISC-V support in Android will continue, the rapid pace of development and the need for further iterations mean a single supported image for all vendors is not yet feasible. This decision implies more work is required before Android is fully prepared for RISC-V integration.

The implications of this setback may result in a prolonged wait before commercial Android devices can operate on RISC-V chips as initially anticipated. Despite the challenges, Google's ongoing commitment to RISC-V support suggests continued efforts in this direction, albeit with a longer timeline than expected.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding Google's setback in supporting RISC-V architecture within the Android Common Kernel includes various perspectives and insights:

- Users express skepticism about the feasibility of supporting RISC-V with a single generic kernel in Android, citing the complexities of hardware requirements and fragmentation issues resulting from various RISC-V extensions.
- There are debates on the practicality of Qualcomm's involvement with RISC-V, with some pointing out potential conflicts due to proprietary interests.
- The discussion delves into the reasons behind Google's decision to remove RISC-V support in Android Generic Kernel Image (GKI), with mentions of Qualcomm-specific issues and Wear OS considerations.
- Some users highlight the potential benefits of RISC-V and the complexities of transitioning to this architecture, including considerations of instruction compression and compatibility with existing systems.
- The conversation also touches on the implications of Google's delay in RISC-V support, comparisons to Apple's Rosetta 2 for Apple Silicon, and speculations about Qualcomm's strategy in relation to RISC-V and ARM.
- Additionally, users discuss the implications of Qualcomm's actions towards RISC-V, potential fragmentation issues with extensions, and the practicality of implementing RISC-V on a wide scale.

### Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM Generations with a Panel of Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18796) | 45 points | by [Jimmc414](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jimmc414) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40215100)

The paper titled "Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM Generations with a Panel of Diverse Models" explores a novel approach to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional evaluation methods struggle to keep up with the advancements in LLMs, leading researchers to propose using a panel of diverse models as judges instead of relying on a single large model like GPT4. This Panel of LLM evaluators (PoLL) approach was found to outperform single large judges, reduce bias, and be more cost-effective. The paper, authored by Pat Verga and a team of researchers, offers valuable insights into improving the evaluation of LLMs.

- cptrs mentions a science fiction novel, "The Freeze-Frame Revolution" by Peter Watts, which features spacefaring AIs running a million-year robotic delay, and highlights the importance of AI interaction and consciousness.
- jon_richards expresses interest in reading the novel, mentioning the focus on sc-fi settings and the relevance of human interaction in the context of advanced technology and AI decay.
- crkd-v comments on the critical writer perspective towards people's Large Language Models (LLMs).
- xnsh discusses the need for incrementally improving performance while massively reducing costs, citing a 7x less expensive improvement method in the context of LLMs.

#### [Submission URL](https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-03-01-policy/) | 37 points | by [synthwave](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=synthwave) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40214305)

The LMSYS Chatbot Arena, a collaborative effort between LMSYS and UC Berkeley SkyLab, aims to advance large language model (LLM) development through open and community-driven evaluations. Since its launch in May 2023, the platform has facilitated the evaluation of over 90 LLMs, providing critical insights into their capabilities and limitations. By engaging millions of participants and collecting extensive user data, including one million prompts, the platform has become a valuable resource for the community.

Emphasizing transparency and community involvement, the platform's infrastructure and evaluation tools are open-source on GitHub, allowing for peer review and reproducibility. The project's commitment to openness is further underscored by its policy of evaluating only publicly released models and involving the community in any changes to the evaluation process.

The platform's policy, last updated on April 29, 2024, outlines guidelines for evaluating both publicly released and unreleased models, ensuring fairness and transparency in the ranking process. By sharing data with the community and model providers, the Chatbot Arena promotes collaboration and knowledge sharing in the field of LLM development.

Through its community-driven approach and dedication to open science, the LMSYS Chatbot Arena serves as a pioneering platform for the evaluation and advancement of large language models, fostering a collaborative environment for the ongoing development of LLM technology.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission regarding the LMSYS Chatbot Arena focused on the evaluation policy for models, particularly the handling of unreleased models. Some users raised concerns about the temporary removal of certain information, speculating that it may be related to preventing the extraction of training data. Others emphasized the importance of ensuring transparency in sharing details with the community and expressed skepticism about companies that do not publicly disclose information.

Additionally, there was a debate about the value of released models versus unreleased models in terms of participation in crowd-sourced training. Some users argued that unreleased models may benefit from participating in evaluations without making their choices publicly known, while others highlighted the limited significance of individual votes in public rankings.

One user sought clarification on the connection between the submission title and the linked pages, which led to a discussion on the GPT-2 chatbot model and its involvement in the LMSYS project.
