### Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM Generations with a Panel of Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18796) | 45 points | by [Jimmc414](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jimmc414) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40215100)

The paper titled "Replacing Judges with Juries: Evaluating LLM Generations with a Panel of Diverse Models" explores a novel approach to evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional evaluation methods struggle to keep up with the advancements in LLMs, leading researchers to propose using a panel of diverse models as judges instead of relying on a single large model like GPT4. This Panel of LLM evaluators (PoLL) approach was found to outperform single large judges, reduce bias, and be more cost-effective. The paper, authored by Pat Verga and a team of researchers, offers valuable insights into improving the evaluation of LLMs.

- cptrs mentions a science fiction novel, "The Freeze-Frame Revolution" by Peter Watts, which features spacefaring AIs running a million-year robotic delay, and highlights the importance of AI interaction and consciousness.
- jon_richards expresses interest in reading the novel, mentioning the focus on sc-fi settings and the relevance of human interaction in the context of advanced technology and AI decay.
- crkd-v comments on the critical writer perspective towards people's Large Language Models (LLMs).
- xnsh discusses the need for incrementally improving performance while massively reducing costs, citing a 7x less expensive improvement method in the context of LLMs.

### Tesla wants to monetize its cars to process AI workloads

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/30/tesla_ai_workloads/) | 11 points | by [sausajez](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sausajez) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40214662)

In Elon Musk's latest brainwave, Tesla cars could potentially become "AWS on wheels," utilizing their idle compute power to process workloads and earn money for the company. This idea was mentioned during Tesla's recent earnings conference call, where the concept of using the abundant processing power in parked vehicles was discussed. The comparison was drawn to Amazon Web Services (AWS), showcasing the potential value of leveraging excess compute capacity. However, there are concerns about practicality and feasibility, including issues surrounding vehicle owner consent, shared profits, battery degradation, and centralized data management. While technically feasible, the downsides might outweigh the benefits, leading some experts to question if the idea will ever materialize. Despite the intriguing concept, some speculate that this could be another one of Elon Musk's attention-grabbing distractions during challenging times for the company.

- The user "cs702" mentions that people are reading various things happening with Tesla, expressing skepticism and implying that complex scripts are running in the background of Tesla vehicles. They also compare the situation to a cloak-and-dagger scenario and discuss the potential workloads being done secretly in Tesla vehicles.
- User "sndspr" comments on the concept of taking caution in making assumptions about things that seem stupid, suggesting that there may be reasons for seemingly dumb decisions, such as a lack of information.
- User "Zelizz" criticizes the assumption that smart people run Tesla while implying that successful companies need a mix of thinkers, including those recognized as stupid. They also compare Tesla's situation to Folding@Home, a distributed computing project, suggesting that Tesla might use their compute power to engage people emotionally rather than legally.
- User "srf" implies that personal success often involves luck and suggests that Tesla's success is built on different principles than perceived by some individuals.
- User "BugsJustFindMe" comments on the mystery of success and the potential benefits for the world and individuals if greater deeds were prioritized over personal gains.
- User "rsynntt" adds a short comment about sometimes doing stupid things, without further elaboration.
