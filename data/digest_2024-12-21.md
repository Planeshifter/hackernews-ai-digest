While traditional object storages like S3 excel in managing static blobs, S2 offers a dedicated streaming experience, allowing for seamless real-time data ingestion and efficient retrieval—even from the seconds or years ago.

Built with the concepts of “basins” for grouping streams, S2 removes the burdens associated with Kafka's cluster management, offering a serverless API that's truly scalable, durable, and cost-effective. It supports concurrent writes with automatic sequencing, meaning users can write into streams without sacrificing performance.

Latency here is impressive, with the Standard storage class providing sub-500ms end-to-end p99 latencies, while the Express class promises even faster acknowledgments under 50ms. All of this occurs without the constraints of traditional cloud streaming systems—making S2 a faster, cheaper, and more agile option.

Also noteworthy is S2’s launch strategy: the service is currently available for free during a preview period, allowing users to provide feedback to refine the offering. The future for S2 is promising, including plans for Kafka compatibility, multi-region capabilities, and potential latencies under 5 milliseconds. 

If you're familiar with traditional streaming solutions but are looking for something that balances power, ease of use, and flexibility, S2 deserves your attention. The future of streaming data storage just got a major upgrade!

### AI Is the Black Mirror

#### [Submission URL](https://nautil.us/ai-is-the-black-mirror-1169121/) | 70 points | by [Jun8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jun8) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42483328)

In a thought-provoking conversation at the British Library, philosopher Shannon Vallor shares her insights on artificial intelligence and its relationship with human cognition. In her 2024 book, "The AI Mirror," Vallor argues that the hype surrounding AI often leads to misguided perceptions of its capabilities, likening AI to a mere reflection of human thought rather than an independent mind. She critiques the tech industry's portrayal of humanity as akin to "mindless machines," a perspective that undermines our capacity for reasoning and complicates our engagement with pressing issues like climate change and democracy.

Vallor emphasizes the need to restore confidence in human judgment while cautioning against the extremes of viewing AI as a benevolent problem-solver or a looming threat. Rather than seeing AI as a competitor, she proposes that we view it as a tool that highlights both our potential and limitations. This nuanced view encourages a deeper understanding of our own minds and urges society to embrace our intrinsic ability to think critically and make informed decisions, especially in an era where technology dominates discourse. As Vallor states, "we need to rebuild our confidence in the capabilities of humans to reason wisely."

In a rich discussion on Hacker News, users scrutinized Shannon Vallor's views on artificial intelligence (AI) as shared in her recent submission about her book "The AI Mirror." Participants highlighted the distinction between large language models (LLMs) and genuine human cognition, with many arguing that LLMs produce statistical outputs devoid of true understanding or "inner life." Some commenters echoed Vallor's sentiment that overhyping AI may distort public perception, reducing human reasoning to simple mechanical outputs.

The debate also veered into philosophical territory, examining whether AI could truly mimic human thought processes. Some users referenced the 'bicameral mind' hypothesis, discussing the implications for AI's potential to autonomously generate thought akin to humans. Others pointed out that while LLMs are powerful, they fundamentally lack consciousness and understanding, which leads to concerns about their portrayal as capable of independent reasoning or understanding emotions.

Several comments acknowledged Vallor's call to reassess our confidence in human judgment, positing that technology shouldn't overshadow our unique cognitive abilities. The notion that AI, when viewed as a mere tool, can reveal human potentials and limitations was warmly received, encouraging a balanced outlook instead of extremes—either reverence for AI as an omnipotent problem-solver or fear of it as an uncontrollable threat.

Ultimately, the discussion reflected a deep philosophical inquiry into AGI's impact on society, underscoring that while AI can emulate human-like responses, it lacks the authentic consciousness and inner judgment inherent to human beings. Users were left pondering the essential qualities that distinguish human cognition from AI capabilities and the implications of how we engage with technology in this evolving landscape.
