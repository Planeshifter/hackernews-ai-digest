The incident serves as a reminder of the growing reliance on technology and how even a small hiccup like a bonus day can have widespread effects. Efforts are underway to investigate the cause and prevent similar events in the future, with some businesses offering apologies and discounts to affected customers. As the situation gets resolved, maybe gas station operators will remember to update their calendars in four years' time.

The discussion on the submission covers a range of perspectives and experiences related to the Leap Day glitch at gas stations in New Zealand. Some users pointed out differences in fueling practices between countries like the US and Europe, where full prepayment is common in some regions. Others shared their experiences with prepayment systems, such as in the UK where paying with cash was still prevalent. The topic of contactless payments also surfaced, with users discussing the varying acceptance and functionality of such methods in different countries. Additionally, there were mentions of payment practices in countries like France, India, and Latin America.

The conversation also touched on security measures at gas stations, with references to prepayment requirements in certain locations like France and Pakistan. The issue of manual authorization when using cards at gas stations was mentioned, contrasting practices from different countries like Denmark where cards are mandatory, and Finland where terminals don't dispense fuel until payment is made.

Furthermore, some users shared humorous anecdotes about their interactions at gas stations, such as mistakenly not noticing the option to pay at self-serve pumps in Europe or encountering delays due to unfamiliar fueling processes.

The discussion also veered towards technical aspects, like the potential scripting and logic flaws that could lead to calendar-related glitches. One user flagged a comment that pointed out the possibility of data manipulation issues involving dates and recommended approaches to avoid such errors.
