### An embarrassingly simple approach to recover unlearned knowledge for LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16454) | 248 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [119 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037982)

A recent paper titled "Does Your LLM Truly Unlearn?" examines a crucial aspect of large language models (LLMs)—the effectiveness of their unlearning capabilities. Authored by a team led by Zhiwei Zhang, the research highlights a significant gap in current practices: while machine unlearning is purported to remove harmful knowledge (such as copyrighted or personal data) without extensive retraining, it may not completely erase this unintended information. 

Through a series of experiments using various quantization techniques, the authors discovered that LLMs could retain a notable amount of "forgotten" knowledge—averaging around 21% in full precision and surging to 83% with quantization to 4 bits. This finding raises questions about the efficacy of existing unlearning methods, which may just conceal rather than eliminate sensitive information. 

The researchers not only present empirical data but also propose a robust unlearning strategy that could help address this critical issue, emphasizing the importance of truly erasing unwanted data from LLMs. This study could have significant implications for the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in sensitive applications.

Many commenters engaged deeply with the implications of this research. Some highlighted concerns about LLMs' retention of copyrighted content, with discussions around the legality and ethical implications of unsupervised learning from proprietary data. Specific comments raised questions about whether existing strategies for unlearning genuinely fulfill their intended purpose or merely hide sensitive data. 

Others contributed to a philosophical debate on intellectual property rights and creativity, noting the challenges of balancing AI development with legal restrictions. There were discussions about the potential consequences if AI systems failed to respect copyright, including increased scrutiny from regulators. 

Overall, the conversation reflects a growing recognition of the complexities surrounding AI model training and data management, emphasizing that effective unlearning remains a pressing concern for developers and researchers in the AI community.
