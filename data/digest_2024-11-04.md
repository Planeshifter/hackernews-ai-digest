### An embarrassingly simple approach to recover unlearned knowledge for LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16454) | 248 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [119 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42037982)

A recent paper titled "Does Your LLM Truly Unlearn?" examines a crucial aspect of large language models (LLMs)—the effectiveness of their unlearning capabilities. Authored by a team led by Zhiwei Zhang, the research highlights a significant gap in current practices: while machine unlearning is purported to remove harmful knowledge (such as copyrighted or personal data) without extensive retraining, it may not completely erase this unintended information. 

Through a series of experiments using various quantization techniques, the authors discovered that LLMs could retain a notable amount of "forgotten" knowledge—averaging around 21% in full precision and surging to 83% with quantization to 4 bits. This finding raises questions about the efficacy of existing unlearning methods, which may just conceal rather than eliminate sensitive information. 

The researchers not only present empirical data but also propose a robust unlearning strategy that could help address this critical issue, emphasizing the importance of truly erasing unwanted data from LLMs. This study could have significant implications for the development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in sensitive applications.

**Daily Digest - Hacker News Summary:**

A recent paper, "Does Your LLM Truly Unlearn?", has sparked an extensive discussion on Hacker News regarding the effectiveness of unlearning techniques in large language models (LLMs). The research, led by Zhiwei Zhang, highlights a critical gap where current unlearning methods may fail to completely erase sensitive information from models. Tests uncovered that LLMs can retain a substantial proportion of "forgotten" knowledge (21% on average, up to 83% with reduced precision quantization).

Many commenters engaged deeply with the implications of this research. Some highlighted concerns about LLMs' retention of copyrighted content, with discussions around the legality and ethical implications of unsupervised learning from proprietary data. Specific comments raised questions about whether existing strategies for unlearning genuinely fulfill their intended purpose or merely hide sensitive data. 

Others contributed to a philosophical debate on intellectual property rights and creativity, noting the challenges of balancing AI development with legal restrictions. There were discussions about the potential consequences if AI systems failed to respect copyright, including increased scrutiny from regulators. 

Overall, the conversation reflects a growing recognition of the complexities surrounding AI model training and data management, emphasizing that effective unlearning remains a pressing concern for developers and researchers in the AI community.

### ChatGPT Search is not OpenAI's 'Google killer' yet

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/11/04/chatgpt-search-is-not-openais-google-killer-yet/) | 22 points | by [achow](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=achow) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42044862)

OpenAI's newly launched ChatGPT Search is generating buzz as a potential contender against Google, but early tests reveal it might still fall short. Maxwell Zeff shares his experiences after a day of using the AI-driven search tool, which promises a fresh, concise interface but often stumbles on everyday queries.

While ChatGPT Search excels at providing detailed answers for complex questions, it struggles with short, keyword-based searches—the bread and butter of Google users. For common inquiries like "Celtics score" or "library hours," Zeff found the AI often delivered inaccurate or irrelevant results, even producing false data and broken links. In contrast, he defaulted back to Google for its reliability, despite acknowledging the latter's gradual decline in quality.

OpenAI’s Sam Altman heralded the new tool's potential, and there’s hope for improvement as user feedback rolls in. Although it might not yet be a "Google killer," ChatGPT Search showcases intriguing possibilities for the future of AI-powered online searching. As it stands, it appears that Google remains the go-to for those quick, navigational queries that dominate most users' daily searches.

In a lively discussion on Hacker News, users engaged with a comment by "BizarroLand" regarding the limitations of ChatGPT Search compared to Google. BizarroLand humorously likened the situation to a mythical battle, suggesting that calling ChatGPT a "Google killer" was overly ambitious. They highlighted the tool's struggles with specific types of searches, including music file queries, and noted the absence of response from ChatGPT in such cases.

In response, "Leynos" referenced a specific query related to file types and pointed out the inadequacies of ChatGPT Search in delivering relevant results, implying that it lacks functionality for practical uses. "FirmwareBurner" chimed in with a lighthearted comment questioning whether large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT may inadvertently reinforce biases instead of correcting them. Overall, the comments emphasized skepticism regarding ChatGPT Search's readiness to rival Google, with humor interspersed throughout the debate.
