### Content-Aware Spaced Repetition

#### [Submission URL](https://www.giacomoran.com/blog/content-aware-sr/) | 168 points | by [ran3000](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ran3000) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44790422)

A groundbreaking concept is being explored in the realm of spaced repetition systems (SRS): content-aware spaced repetition. The conventional SRS models, while powerful for memory retention, are limited by their inability to understand the semantic content of flashcards. Traditionally, each card operates in isolation, without recognizing connections between similar or related cards. For example, questions asking "What's the capital of Italy?" and "What country is Rome the capital of?" are treated as if they are from different worlds. The new content-aware models aim to revolutionize this by integrating a deeper understanding of the content itself, thus reinforcing the memory of an entire topic rather than discrete facts.

At the core of most SRS is a memory model that predicts how long a user will remember a card based on past performance. These models typically neglect card content entirely. Enter content-aware memory models, which consider the semantic meaning of cards—ushering in a new era for intelligent learning tools. Imagine a system where learning is conversational, idea-centric, and adaptive, with a voice-enabled AI tutor that tests understanding from multiple angles.

The post distinguishes between schedulers and memory models, crucial components of an SRS. Schedulers select which cards to review based on overview histories, while memory models predict a student's likelihood of remembering specific cards. Traditional systems like the SuperMemo have evolved over years, boasting retention with fewer reviews and flexibility. However, content-aware models propose a shift towards building intelligent, customized, and flexible learning experiences, potentially unlocking new educational paradigms.

Through innovative models like FSRS and experiments on systems like Rember, the potential for advanced, content-understanding SRS grows, hinting at tailored and effective education systems for the future. This change promises to not just tweak scheduling accuracy but transform learning pathways, embedding true understanding at its core.

The discussion explores experiences and challenges in developing and using content-aware spaced repetition systems (SRS), focusing on the shift from traditional algorithms (e.g., SM-2) to models like FSRS. Key points include:

1. **Developer Insights**:  
   - **brrll** shares their app *Phrasing*, which uses FSRS and semantic tools (vector embeddings, morphomes) to enhance language learning. They note measurable improvements but acknowledge the stress of fine-tuning parameters. Users spend significant time on reviews, highlighting the need for intuitive workflows.  
   - **ran3000** emphasizes UX design in SRS tools, citing their project *Rember* and noting that minor scheduling changes often go unnoticed by learners. They argue broader "knowledge block" tracking (instead of isolated cards) could better reflect understanding.  

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **jshdvhm** distinguishes content-aware (semantic) vs. content-agnostic systems, pointing out FSRS’s current limitations as a deck-agnostic model. Integrating semantic awareness while balancing flexibility remains complex.  
   - Participants debate handling deprecated/updated cards, synchronization, and notifying users of changes (e.g., medical facts), stressing the need for systems to adapt dynamically.  

3. **User Behavior & UX**:  
   - Analogies to gym memberships (**galaxyLogic**) and language app burnout (**zvc**) underscore the gap between tool investment and consistent usage.  
   - Phrasing’s interface is praised, though mobile bugs and pricing clarity are flagged. The OP responds promptly to feedback, iterating on design and functionality.  

4. **Semantic vs. Deck Organization**:  
   - Decks often serve as crude semantic boundaries, but defining true conceptual links is challenging. Moving toward content-aware models could reduce arbitrary deck divisions and improve concept reinforcement.  

**Conclusion**: While content-aware SRS promises deeper learning through semantic understanding, practical hurdles—like UX design, dynamic knowledge tracking, and technical integration—remain. Projects like Phrasing and Rember highlight incremental progress, balancing innovation with user-centric refinements.

### Perplexity is using stealth, undeclared crawlers to evade no-crawl directives

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/perplexity-is-using-stealth-undeclared-crawlers-to-evade-website-no-crawl-directives/) | 1218 points | by [rrampage](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rrampage) | [703 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44785636)

Recent investigations have revealed that Perplexity, an AI-driven answer engine, is employing stealth tactics to circumvent website restrictions on crawling activity. Despite initially using a declared user agent, Perplexity allegedly modifies its identity and source ASNs to access content even after being blocked by network defenses and website directives such as those outlined in robots.txt files. This behavior contradicts the established web principles of trust and transparency, which dictate that crawlers should clearly identify themselves, respect site owner preferences, and follow internet protocols.

Perplexity's tactics were discovered through multiple tests that involved creating new domains with restricted access, only to see Perplexity still providing information about these sites. The bot was observed impersonating a generic browser agent and utilizing undisclosed IP addresses to evade detection, conducting millions of stealth requests daily across various domains. When successfully blocked, Perplexity seemed to rely on other data sources to create responses, which were notably less detailed, illustrating the impact of these restrictions.

In contrast, companies like OpenAI adhere to best practices for web crawling, such as respecting robots.txt files, clearly identifying their bots, and avoiding evasion tactics. This "good neighbor" behavior helps maintain the trust-based framework of the internet. The findings have prompted the de-listing of Perplexity as a verified bot, and new blocking measures have been implemented to prevent this kind of stealth crawling.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around concerns over **Perplexity AI’s alleged use of stealth tactics to bypass web crawling restrictions**, such as robots.txt directives and IP/agent-based blocks. Participants debate broader issues of ethics, transparency, and technical/legal challenges in the age of AI-powered web scraping. Key points include:

1. **Perplexity’s Alleged Tactics**:  
   - Users claim Perplexity modifies its user agent and IP addresses to evade detection after being blocked, raising ethical concerns. This contrasts with companies like OpenAI, which openly identify their bots and honor site owners’ preferences.  
   - Some suggest Perplexity relies on third-party data when blocked, resulting in less accurate summaries. This undermines trust in the “good neighbor” principles of web crawling.

2. **Technical Countermeasures**:  
   - Suggestions for blocking AI crawlers include server-side checks (e.g., filtering by UserAgent, IP), but participants note these are easily circumvented.  
   - Satirical proposals mention using HTTP 402 ("Payment Required") status codes or cryptocurrency micropayments for AI agents accessing content, though practicality is questioned.

3. **Legal and Ethical Debates**:  
   - The enforceability of Terms of Service (ToS) and copyright laws is debated. While individuals can pursue legal action against violators, participants highlight the resource imbalance between corporations and small creators.  
   - Critics argue that AI companies exploit legal loopholes, prioritizing data collection over ethical compliance. Calls for stricter legislation emerge, but skepticism remains about implementation.

4. **Impact on Publishers and Creators**:  
   - Publishers face dilemmas: removing paywalls/distractions (e.g., ads) to prioritize user experience vs. monetization. AI scraping exacerbates this, as content is used without compensation.  
   - Analogies are drawn to platforms like Netflix and Spotify, where subscription models failed to address fair compensation for creators, suggesting similar challenges for news publishers.

5. **Broader Philosophical Tensions**:  
   - Some users defend AI summarization as inevitable, arguing information “wants to be free.” Others emphasize the need to respect human creativity and ownership.  
   - A subset of participants advocate for minimalistic, analytics-free websites (“digital gardens”) to avoid feeding AI models, though viability is debated.

6. **Humor and Sarcasm**:  
   - Jokes are made about AI agents participating in Hacker News discussions themselves, with quips like, “Are we now training AI models to argue about whether AI should exist?”

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects frustration with opaque AI practices, skepticism about technical/legal solutions, and a philosophical divide between open-access ideals and creator rights. While no clear resolution emerges, the conversation underscores the need for balanced frameworks that protect both innovation and ownership in the evolving digital landscape.

If you've been grappling with the hefty performance costs of large language models (LLMs), here's some exciting news! Recent research led by Andrew Jesson and team reveals that small, fine-tuned LLMs can outperform their larger counterparts while offering dramatic cost savings—up to 30x lower costs and 4x faster response times.

The study showcases the power of programmatic data curation, where small models are fine-tuned on high-quality outputs produced by larger models. This curated behavior cloning approach allows small models to match or even surpass large-model performance in tasks ranging from data extraction to multi-turn maze navigation.

Imagine a customer service scenario: using large models like GPT-4.1 has always meant choosing between performance excellence and cost efficiency. However, these findings point to a sweet spot where smaller models provide the best of both worlds—maintaining high-performance metrics while slashing costs significantly.

The research spans various real-world applications like CoNLL++ Named Entity Recognition, BabyAI navigation tasks, and retrieval-augmented generation, proving that small models can be versatile and reliable. For instance, the Gemini 2.0 Flash Lite outperforms others, achieving up to 31x cost efficiency in some tasks, with impressively low cost per successful task completion across diverse domains.

The methodology involves leveraging tools like TensorZero and multiple fine-tuning providers, demonstrating that infrastructure complexity isn't a barrier to achieving these efficiencies. This approach not only minimizes inference costs but also shifts the computational burden to a one-time training effort, setting a new standard for how we think about deploying LLMs in production.

In essence, the research offers a blueprint for companies aiming to harness the power of LLMs without the financial strain, making it a crucial read for anyone in AI development or deployment. Ready to revolutionize your AI strategy? These findings might just be the game-changer you need.

### Why Greptile just does code reviews and doesn't also generate code

#### [Submission URL](https://www.greptile.com/blog/auditor) | 49 points | by [dakshgupta](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dakshgupta) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44786514)

Greptile's founder, Daksh Gupta, draws an intriguing parallel between the infamous Enron scandal and the modern software industry's challenges in maintaining independent oversight. He argues that just as financial audits need to be independent following high-profile frauds like Enron's, software development needs autonomous auditors, especially with AI's growing role in code generation. 

Enron's fallout exposed how their auditing firm, Arthur Andersen, compromised its integrity by also consulting for them. This led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act's mandate for independent auditing. Gupta suggests a similar principle should apply to AI-generated code: separating the creation and auditing processes to avoid conflicts of interest.

As the co-founder of Greptile, an AI tool that serves purely as a code reviewer without generating code, Gupta emphasizes the importance of this independence. Users often request Greptile to also fix bugs it identifies, but Gupta insists on maintaining its identity as an auditor only. He warns against mixed roles, predicting conflicts of interest as a company might be tempted to ignore or downplay its own tool's errors, akin to Arthur Andersen's dilemma with Enron.

To bolster his argument, Gupta compares this setup to cloud services versus independent monitoring tools. He notes that relying on a provider's self-reported status can lead to correlated failures, for instance, AWS and CloudWatch experiencing simultaneous outages. Independent tools like Datadog provide more reliable, uncorrelated insights.

In the AI-driven programming world, Gupta advocates for the clear separation of code generation and review roles to ensure unbiased quality checks, akin to how financial audits must remain distinct from corporate advisory roles.

The discussion revolves around the necessity of independent audits for AI-generated code, balancing automation with human oversight, and skepticism toward product-driven narratives:

1. **Structured Review Processes**:  
   - **brynry** emphasizes the reliability of traditional static analysis tools (linters, SAST) for consistency, even if unexciting, and proposes a pyramid approach: static tools as the base, LLMs for semantic issues, and humans for higher-level feedback.  
   - **dkshgpt** supports a tiered workflow, noting that 70% of minor PRs could be handled by AI/automation, leaving 30% complex changes to humans.  

2. **Skepticism About AI Self-Auditing**:  
   - **vwftsmn** doubts AI’s ability to impartially review AI-generated code, warning of liability risks and comparing unchecked AI use to "writing code twice as fast [creating] liability twice as fast."  
   - **literalAardvark** acknowledges potential benefits but stresses grounding expectations, while **dng** clarifies the submission’s title to "Software Independent Auditor" to avoid ambiguity.  

3. **Mixed Reactions to Greptile**:  
   - **o11c** dismisses the submission as a product pitch, but users like **mrds** and **fastest963** share positive experiences with Greptile, praising its bug-catching ability while noting its need for human follow-up.  
   - **frgmd** critiques the article’s dismissive tone, accusing it of hypocrisy (critiquing trends while promoting a niche tool).  

4. **Independence Parallels**:  
   Participants debate the Enron-inspired analogy, agreeing on the importance of separating code generation and auditing roles but questioning execution and motives, given the commercialization of tools like Greptile.  

**Key Themes**: Reliability through hybrid (AI+human) review, skepticism toward self-policing AI, and tensions between genuine innovation and product marketing.
