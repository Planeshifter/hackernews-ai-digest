Raise the Bar: Pieces Enhances OCR for Code Recognition

The team at Pieces has been hard at work refining their optical character recognition (OCR) engine to better serve software developers. OCR, a technology that translates printed or handwritten text from images into machine-readable data, is vital for modern document processing. By advancing this technology, Pieces is enabling more accurate transcription of code from digital images—an innovation that could revolutionize the way developers work with screenshots from IDEs, terminals, and even online videos.

Pieces leverages Tesseract, a robust free OCR tool, as their primary engine, but enhances it specifically for code with unique pre- and post-processing steps. This includes standardizing inputs through advanced image pre-processing techniques. For instance, Dark Mode images are inverted by calculating pixel brightness, ensuring clear code transcription. Additionally, gradient and noisy background challenges are tackled using dilation-based filtering and median blurring, while low-resolution concerns are mitigated using bicubic upsampling.

Understanding that code's layout is essential for readability and functionality, especially in languages like Python, Pieces further refined Tesseract's text prediction to preserve code indentation through nuanced layout analyses.

Through rigorous testing using datasets and evaluating methods like super-resolution models against bicubic interpolation, Pieces continues to fine-tune and validate their approach for optimal performance. While exploring super-resolution models appeared promising, bicubic upsampling was chosen for its efficiency without significant performance trade-offs.

As Pieces pushes the boundaries of OCR capabilities for coding, their solution not only captures structured syntax but also adapts to unstructured elements like variable names and code comments. Developers are invited to experience these enhancements via the Pieces desktop app, while API enthusiasts can reach out via email for further integration details. By bridging the gap between digital and machine-readable formats, Pieces is setting a new standard in OCR technology for developers.

In the eerily prescient tale "The Machine Stops," we're drawn into a world where humanity has become entirely dependent on an autonomous system known as "the Machine." In a hexagonal room devoid of traditional windows or lamps, Vashti, a figure disconnected from the outside world, lives a life dictated by the conveniences of technology. Her son, Kuno, reaches out through this mechanical marvel to express a yearning that sets him apart—a desire to break free from this virtual cocoon and experience genuine human connection.

Kuno implores Vashti to visit him in person, presenting a stark contrast to their screen-mediated interactions. His longing to see the stars from the earth, rather than the confines of an airship, speaks to a deeper wish to reconnect with a world once brimming with tangible life. Vashti, however, is resistant, preferring the sterile comfort of her mechanized environment to the uncertain authenticity of the surface world. Her reluctance mirrors a society that has traded depth and reality for the fleeting convenience of machine-mediated experiences.

The story explores themes of dependency on technology, the erosion of direct human interaction, and the lost appreciation for the natural world. Kuno's desire for face-to-face communication and his metaphor of stars resembling a sword-wielding man hint at a profound discontent with a life lived through filters and screens.

### LLM function calls don't scale; code orchestration is simpler, more effective

#### [Submission URL](https://jngiam.bearblog.dev/mcp-large-data/) | 266 points | by [jngiam1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jngiam1) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44053744)

In a recent deep dive, the limitations of scaling language model (LLM) function calls in machine-control protocol (MCP) tools become abundantly clear. Current methods involve feeding the entire output from tool calls back into the LLM and hoping it can decipher the data to trigger subsequent actions. While this approach works in small, controlled environments, adding larger, real-world data scales up both complexity and cost, revealing significant inefficiencies.

The key issue lies in treating data and task orchestration as part of a single conversation with the LLM, a method that struggles with structured data like the JSON blobs returned by tools such as Linear and Intercom. These blobs, although similar to typical APIs, lack predefined schemas, making parsing challenging. Consequently, the LLM often ends up reposting this bulky data, leading to slow processing times and potential data inaccuracies.

Enter orchestration through code execution. By using code to interpret and manage data, we tap into a system that’s not only more intuitive but also infinitely scalable. Variables within code can store data natively, eliminating the need for cumbersome external systems. Meanwhile, well-choreographed tool chaining allows for efficient function calls and data processing without forcing the LLM to regurgitate vast data sets.

As MCP specs evolve to define output schemas, this new structured approach is set to unlock use cases like building custom dashboards and generating reports. However, this transition demands a shift in how execution environments handle security and persistence, especially when dealing with AI-generated code and sensitive tool access. The solution, potentially a new class of "AI runtimes," must balance robust security measures and the ability to handle prolonged, stateful operations.

The community is invited to explore and refine this groundbreaking avenue, with platforms like Lutra offering an open door for collaborative innovation.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around challenges and solutions for scaling LLM-driven systems, particularly in managing structured data and workflow orchestration. Key points include:

1. **Structured Data & Determinism**:  
   Participants emphasize the need for **structured data schemas** (e.g., typed JSON) to reduce ambiguity and improve reliability. While LLMs struggle with unstructured data blobs, deterministic code or hybrid approaches (e.g., combining LLMs with traditional algorithms) are seen as critical for tasks like report generation or dashboard creation. However, LLMs’ probabilistic nature completely deterministic outcomes, requiring fallback strategies.

2. **Code Orchestration vs. LLM Reliance**:  
   Many advocate for **code-based orchestration** (e.g., Shopify’s open-source [Roast](https://github.com/Shopify/roast)) to handle workflows deterministically, reserving LLMs for ambiguous sub-tasks. This reduces cognitive load on models and avoids repetitive data regurgitation. Others propose domain-specific languages (DSLs) or symbolic systems as alternatives to pure LLM-driven logic.

3. **Real-World Use Cases & Tools**:  
   - Shopify’s Roast framework is praised for blending deterministic and non-deterministic steps in workflows (e.g., customer support automation).  
   - Tools like GraphQL and custom gateways are suggested to streamline MCP/API interactions by filtering unnecessary data upfront.  
   - Skepticism exists about overhyped “AI-native” solutions, with some noting past failures in AI-driven predictions and the importance of incremental, practical applications.

4. **Challenges & Trade-offs**:  
   - **Execution errors** (e.g., hallucinated dashboard metrics) and **state management** in distributed systems remain hurdles.  
   - Security concerns arise with AI-generated code, necessitating sandboxed “AI runtimes.”  
   - Debate persists on balancing flexibility (LLMs) vs. structure (code), with some arguing current models still lack the reliability for mission-critical tasks.

5. **Community Sentiment**:  
   While some express optimism about evolving specs (e.g., MCP schemas) enabling new use cases, others are cynical about the industry’s fixation on LLMs for problems solvable with simpler, deterministic systems. The tension between rapid experimentation and delivering robust production solutions is evident.

**Final Takeaway**: The path forward likely involves hybrid systems—leveraging LLMs for ambiguity resolution within tightly scoped, code-orchestrated workflows—while prioritizing structured data and rigorous error handling. Platforms like Lutra and Roast exemplify this balance, but scalability and security remain open challenges.

### Building an agentic image generator that improves itself

#### [Submission URL](https://simulate.trybezel.com/research/image_agent) | 61 points | by [palashshah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=palashshah) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44051090)

In the fast-evolving world of digital marketing, the need for dynamically tailored advertisements is more critical than ever. A recent story from Bezel demonstrates innovative strides in this field, detailing the creation of an agentic image generator powered by OpenAI’s API. At Bezel, they specialize in building personas—detailed user models—that help major brands better target their advertisements. The challenge: turning these personas into actual ad content.

Employing OpenAI’s Image API, Bezel’s approach engages two endpoints for image creation and editing. The /create endpoint generates images from prompts, while the /edit endpoint tweaks them based on user specifications—such as masking certain sections for enhancement. To ensure the output images meet high standards, Bezel turned to advanced large language models (LLMs), treating them as critique engines. These evaluators spotlight errors like text blurriness or an underwhelming visual draw, establishing a guided feedback loop facilitating iterative improvements.

Here's a breakdown of their methodology: Initially utilizing a text-focused perspective with the "LLM-as-a-Judge" system, the strategy entailed a precise definition of visual flaws—using models like o3 and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04 to scan for, and correct, imperfections in text rendering. For instance, they confronted issues like the indistinct labeling on RedBull cans in an imagined ad scenario. Utilizing an iterative editing function, they achieved significant text clarity with around three refinements per image, suggesting a technical performance limit.

The innovation didn't stop there. Bezel expanded their system’s evaluative capacity to assess abstract aspects, such as overall image composition and consumer appeal. They posed questions concerning visual harmony and engagement potential—things the LLMs could judge based on the criteria set by Bezel's detailed personas.

Through this exploratory and iterative technique, Bezel is not just enhancing the aesthetic and functional quality of AI-generated images but also advancing towards an autonomous, self-improving system that can deliver advertisements that are spot-on for every niche demographic—or persona—it encounters. This progression marks a pivotal step in not only just-in-time marketing but also in the broader landscape of artificial intelligence's role in digital creativity.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

Are you fascinated by polynomial multiplication and its deeper connections to concepts like convolution in signals and systems? Eli Bendersky's post is here to unravel these intriguing mathematical relationships for you. 

It kicks off with a classic exercise from middle school math—multiplying two polynomials through cross-multiplication and summing up like terms. But then it delves into a more structured way to tackle the same problem using a table method, where you multiply diagonally aligned terms from two polynomials laid out in rows and columns to collect coefficients. This approach reveals an interesting diagonal pattern and leads to a more abstract perspective on polynomial multiplication.

The post then introduces the formal mathematical formulation: for two polynomials P and R, their product polynomial S can be calculated as a sum of products of coefficients from P and R, rearranged in a specific way. This setup is not just another method but a key to understanding the deeper ideas behind polynomial multiplication.

Furthermore, the piece draws a parallel to convolution sums—a concept central to digital signal processing. If multiplying polynomials sounds akin to computing convolutions, that's because it truly is! Bendersky explains how discrete signals and systems can be represented and manipulated using similar methods, highlighting the elegance of this abstraction.

### It’s So Over, We’re So Back: Doomer Techno-Optimism (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://americanaffairsjournal.org/2025/05/its-so-over-were-so-back-doomer-techno-optimism/) | 33 points | by [Multicomp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Multicomp) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44055771)

In the ever-evolving discourse of economic stagnation and technological innovation, two recent books make notable contributions to what some call "doomer techno-optimism." This perspective acknowledges a stalled growth trajectory but proposes ambitious rejuvenation through science and technology. The books "Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation" by tech investors Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, and "The New Lunar Society: An Enlightenment Guide to the Next Industrial Revolution" by MIT professor David A. Mindell delve into this dialogue, offering differing approaches to overcoming the challenges of stagnation.

Boom, published by Stripe Press, posits a provocative notion that economic bubbles, typically viewed as precursors to downturns, could instead act as catalysts for a new era of technological advancement and growth. Hobart and Huber challenge the conventional perspective by seeing bubbles as venues for innovation, identifying them as opportunities rather than threats. They argue for a reassessment of societal risk tolerances to foster innovation and escape homogeneity, urging readers to take risks that could yield significant societal advancements.

Mindell's "The New Lunar Society" offers a blueprint for an industrial revolution guided by Enlightenment ideals, aiming to harness technological and scientific progress. As global political and cultural landscapes increasingly resonate with Silicon Valley ethos, both these books provide keen insights into navigating and shaping the future. They encapsulate the essence of the doomer techno-optimist belief: recognizing the stagnation we face while charting a path forward driven by technological ingenuity and bold, optimistic visions for progress. Together, these works underscore the high aspirations and potential limitations inherent in this emerging narrative.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around critiques and expansions of the original article's "doomer techno-optimism" thesis, focusing on economic bubbles, productivity stagnation, and technological progress. Key points include:

1. **Economic Bubbles**:  
   - Users highlight omissions in the article, such as Japan’s 1980s real estate bubble (which devastated the Nikkei index) and China’s ongoing housing crisis, characterized by unfinished buildings and risky mortgage practices.  
   - Historical bubbles like the 19th-century **Railway Mania** and the 1990s telecom bubble are noted as cautionary examples—while they spurred infrastructure, they also wiped out investors and distorted markets.  

2. **Productivity Debates**:  
   - **Stagnation since 1973**: A user points out flat U.S. productivity growth post-1973, with wages failing to keep pace despite corporate profits.  
   - **Measurement Challenges**: Subthreads debate how productivity is quantified. Critics argue traditional metrics (e.g., BLS/FRED data) may not capture sectors like healthcare, where outcomes (e.g., longer lifespans) aren’t easily measured. Others note that offshoring manufacturing to China inflates U.S. productivity stats, masking reliance on low-wage labor abroad.  

3. **Techno-Optimism Critiques**:  
   - Users question the article’s optimism, citing examples like **fracking** (viewed as cost-reduction tech, not a bubble) and modern software (e.g., "buggy" Windows PCs) as evidence that innovation doesn’t always translate to societal benefit.  
   - **Human-centric tech**: One comment stresses the need for technology to prioritize human flourishing over abstract growth, contrasting past optimism (e.g., Windows XP) with today’s fragmented platforms.  

4. **Political and Systemic Critiques**:  
   - Skepticism emerges about Silicon Valley’s self-serving narratives, with references to "Constitution Free Zones," tax havens, and corporate profit motives.  
   - A user dismisses "doomer techno-optimism" as detached from historical lessons, advocating for grounded critiques of power structures.  

5. **Miscellaneous**:  
   - The role of unproductive spending in healthcare/education is flagged as a driver of wage stagnation.  
   - References to books by Cowan and Thiel critique the article’s optimism, framing it as part of a cyclical, overhyped narrative.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion broadly challenges the article’s framing, emphasizing historical context, measurement complexities, and systemic critiques over techno-utopianism.
