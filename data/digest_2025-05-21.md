In a groundbreaking revelation, Ryan Williams, a theoretical computer scientist at MIT, has transformed our understanding of computational complexity with a stunning proof that challenges long-held assumptions. For the first time in 50 years, significant progress has been made in the complex relationship between time and memory (space) in computing.

Williams, initially skeptical of his own findings, discovered a mathematical proof suggesting that a small amount of memory can be as effective as ample computational time for any type of task. After rigorous validation and feedback from peers, the proof was published and hailed as revolutionary.

This landmark discovery proposes a way to transform any algorithm to require significantly less memory without compromising its function. Additionally, it implies a corollary about the limitations of what can be computed within a specific timeframe, a concept assumed true but never proven until now.

The work echoes Williams’ creative use of space, both in his lived environment and his imaginative solution to this longstanding problem. Williams’ background, from his initial fascination with computers in rural Alabama to his academic pursuits in theoretical computer science, paints a picture of a lifetime spent exploring the possibilities of computation.

In the eerily prescient tale "The Machine Stops," we're drawn into a world where humanity has become entirely dependent on an autonomous system known as "the Machine." In a hexagonal room devoid of traditional windows or lamps, Vashti, a figure disconnected from the outside world, lives a life dictated by the conveniences of technology. Her son, Kuno, reaches out through this mechanical marvel to express a yearning that sets him apart—a desire to break free from this virtual cocoon and experience genuine human connection.

Kuno implores Vashti to visit him in person, presenting a stark contrast to their screen-mediated interactions. His longing to see the stars from the earth, rather than the confines of an airship, speaks to a deeper wish to reconnect with a world once brimming with tangible life. Vashti, however, is resistant, preferring the sterile comfort of her mechanized environment to the uncertain authenticity of the surface world. Her reluctance mirrors a society that has traded depth and reality for the fleeting convenience of machine-mediated experiences.

The story explores themes of dependency on technology, the erosion of direct human interaction, and the lost appreciation for the natural world. Kuno's desire for face-to-face communication and his metaphor of stars resembling a sword-wielding man hint at a profound discontent with a life lived through filters and screens. It's an evocative narrative that prompts reflection on our current trajectory with technology and the vital elements of the human experience we risk losing.

### LLM function calls don't scale; code orchestration is simpler, more effective

#### [Submission URL](https://jngiam.bearblog.dev/mcp-large-data/) | 266 points | by [jngiam1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jngiam1) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44053744)

In a recent deep dive, the limitations of scaling language model (LLM) function calls in machine-control protocol (MCP) tools become abundantly clear. Current methods involve feeding the entire output from tool calls back into the LLM and hoping it can decipher the data to trigger subsequent actions. While this approach works in small, controlled environments, adding larger, real-world data scales up both complexity and cost, revealing significant inefficiencies.

The key issue lies in treating data and task orchestration as part of a single conversation with the LLM, a method that struggles with structured data like the JSON blobs returned by tools such as Linear and Intercom. These blobs, although similar to typical APIs, lack predefined schemas, making parsing challenging. Consequently, the LLM often ends up reposting this bulky data, leading to slow processing times and potential data inaccuracies.

Enter orchestration through code execution. By using code to interpret and manage data, we tap into a system that’s not only more intuitive but also infinitely scalable. Variables within code can store data natively, eliminating the need for cumbersome external systems. Meanwhile, well-choreographed tool chaining allows for efficient function calls and data processing without forcing the LLM to regurgitate vast data sets.

As MCP specs evolve to define output schemas, this new structured approach is set to unlock use cases like building custom dashboards and generating reports. However, this transition demands a shift in how execution environments handle security and persistence, especially when dealing with AI-generated code and sensitive tool access. The solution, potentially a new class of "AI runtimes," must balance robust security measures and the ability to handle prolonged, stateful operations.

The community is invited to explore and refine this groundbreaking avenue, with platforms like Lutra offering an open door for collaborative innovation.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around challenges and solutions for scaling LLM-driven systems, particularly in managing structured data and workflow orchestration. Key points include:

1. **Structured Data & Determinism**:  
   Participants emphasize the need for **structured data schemas** (e.g., typed JSON) to reduce ambiguity and improve reliability. While LLMs struggle with unstructured data blobs, deterministic code or hybrid approaches (e.g., combining LLMs with traditional algorithms) are seen as critical for tasks like report generation or dashboard creation. However, LLMs’ probabilistic nature completely deterministic outcomes, requiring fallback strategies.

2. **Code Orchestration vs. LLM Reliance**:  
   Many advocate for **code-based orchestration** (e.g., Shopify’s open-source [Roast](https://github.com/Shopify/roast)) to handle workflows deterministically, reserving LLMs for ambiguous sub-tasks. This reduces cognitive load on models and avoids repetitive data regurgitation. Others propose domain-specific languages (DSLs) or symbolic systems as alternatives to pure LLM-driven logic.

3. **Real-World Use Cases & Tools**:  
   - Shopify’s Roast framework is praised for blending deterministic and non-deterministic steps in workflows (e.g., customer support automation).  
   - Tools like GraphQL and custom gateways are suggested to streamline MCP/API interactions by filtering unnecessary data upfront.  
   - Skepticism exists about overhyped “AI-native” solutions, with some noting past failures in AI-driven predictions and the importance of incremental, practical applications.

4. **Challenges & Trade-offs**:  
   - **Execution errors** (e.g., hallucinated dashboard metrics) and **state management** in distributed systems remain hurdles.  
   - Security concerns arise with AI-generated code, necessitating sandboxed “AI runtimes.”  
   - Debate persists on balancing flexibility (LLMs) vs. structure (code), with some arguing current models still lack the reliability for mission-critical tasks.

5. **Community Sentiment**:  
   While some express optimism about evolving specs (e.g., MCP schemas) enabling new use cases, others are cynical about the industry’s fixation on LLMs for problems solvable with simpler, deterministic systems. The tension between rapid experimentation and delivering robust production solutions is evident.

**Final Takeaway**: The path forward likely involves hybrid systems—leveraging LLMs for ambiguity resolution within tightly scoped, code-orchestrated workflows—while prioritizing structured data and rigorous error handling. Platforms like Lutra and Roast exemplify this balance, but scalability and security remain open challenges.

### Building an agentic image generator that improves itself

#### [Submission URL](https://simulate.trybezel.com/research/image_agent) | 61 points | by [palashshah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=palashshah) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44051090)

In the fast-evolving world of digital marketing, the need for dynamically tailored advertisements is more critical than ever. A recent story from Bezel demonstrates innovative strides in this field, detailing the creation of an agentic image generator powered by OpenAI’s API. At Bezel, they specialize in building personas—detailed user models—that help major brands better target their advertisements. The challenge: turning these personas into actual ad content.

Employing OpenAI’s Image API, Bezel’s approach engages two endpoints for image creation and editing. The /create endpoint generates images from prompts, while the /edit endpoint tweaks them based on user specifications—such as masking certain sections for enhancement. To ensure the output images meet high standards, Bezel turned to advanced large language models (LLMs), treating them as critique engines. These evaluators spotlight errors like text blurriness or an underwhelming visual draw, establishing a guided feedback loop facilitating iterative improvements.

Here's a breakdown of their methodology: Initially utilizing a text-focused perspective with the "LLM-as-a-Judge" system, the strategy entailed a precise definition of visual flaws—using models like o3 and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04 to scan for, and correct, imperfections in text rendering. For instance, they confronted issues like the indistinct labeling on RedBull cans in an imagined ad scenario. Utilizing an iterative editing function, they achieved significant text clarity with around three refinements per image, suggesting a technical performance limit.

The innovation didn't stop there. Bezel expanded their system’s evaluative capacity to assess abstract aspects, such as overall image composition and consumer appeal. They posed questions concerning visual harmony and engagement potential—things the LLMs could judge based on the criteria set by Bezel's detailed personas.

Through this exploratory and iterative technique, Bezel is not just enhancing the aesthetic and functional quality of AI-generated images but also advancing towards an autonomous, self-improving system that can deliver advertisements that are spot-on for every niche demographic—or persona—it encounters. This progression marks a pivotal step in not only just-in-time marketing but also in the broader landscape of artificial intelligence's role in digital creativity.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

### Convolutions, Polynomials and Flipped Kernels

#### [Submission URL](https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2025/convolutions-polynomials-and-flipped-kernels/) | 101 points | by [mfrw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfrw) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44048306)

Are you fascinated by polynomial multiplication and its deeper connections to concepts like convolution in signals and systems? Eli Bendersky's post is here to unravel these intriguing mathematical relationships for you. 

It kicks off with a classic exercise from middle school math—multiplying two polynomials through cross-multiplication and summing up like terms. But then it delves into a more structured way to tackle the same problem using a table method, where you multiply diagonally aligned terms from two polynomials laid out in rows and columns to collect coefficients. This approach reveals an interesting diagonal pattern and leads to a more abstract perspective on polynomial multiplication.

The post then introduces the formal mathematical formulation: for two polynomials P and R, their product polynomial S can be calculated as a sum of products of coefficients from P and R, rearranged in a specific way. This setup is not just another method but a key to understanding the deeper ideas behind polynomial multiplication.

Furthermore, the piece draws a parallel to convolution sums—a concept central to digital signal processing. If multiplying polynomials sounds akin to computing convolutions, that's because it truly is! Bendersky explains how discrete signals and systems can be represented and manipulated using similar methods, highlighting the elegance of this abstraction. Graphical representations in the post help illustrate these concepts, showing how flipping and shifting polynomial alignments yield the terms of the product polynomial.

For those who have a penchant for math, this post brings an invigorating twist to a familiar operation by linking it to signal processing, paving the way for rich insights into computational techniques used in engineering and beyond.

   - Used in combinatorics, probabilistic modeling (e.g., Z-transforms), and physics. A whimsical mention of their role in analyzing the "Mafia game" highlights their versatility.  

2. **Convolution & Probability**:  
   - Convolution describes the distribution of sums (e.g., \(X + Y\)) of random variables, while the maximum (e.g., \(\text{Max}(X, Y)\)) requires multiplying cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) under independence. Debate clarified that convolution applies to probability density functions (PDFs) for sums and CDF products for maxima.  
   - Practical challenges arise in systems like MapReduce/Hadoop, where job completion times depend on the slowest task ("max" operation). Heavy-tailed distributions complicate optimization, prompting workarounds like tiered redundancy.

In the ever-evolving discourse of economic stagnation and technological innovation, two recent books make notable contributions to what some call "doomer techno-optimism." This perspective acknowledges a stalled growth trajectory but proposes ambitious rejuvenation through science and technology. The books "Boom: Bubbles and the End of Stagnation" by tech investors Byrne Hobart and Tobias Huber, and "The New Lunar Society: An Enlightenment Guide to the Next Industrial Revolution" by MIT professor David A. Mindell delve into this dialogue, offering differing approaches to overcoming the challenges of stagnation.

Boom, published by Stripe Press, posits a provocative notion that economic bubbles, typically viewed as precursors to downturns, could instead act as catalysts for a new era of technological advancement and growth. Hobart and Huber challenge the conventional perspective by seeing bubbles as venues for innovation, identifying them as opportunities rather than threats. They argue for a reassessment of societal risk tolerances to foster innovation and escape homogeneity, urging readers to take risks that could yield significant societal advancements.

Mindell's "The New Lunar Society" offers a blueprint for an industrial revolution guided by Enlightenment ideals, aiming to harness technological and scientific progress. As global political and cultural landscapes increasingly resonate with Silicon Valley ethos, both these books provide keen insights into navigating and shaping the future. They encapsulate the essence of the doomer techno-optimist belief: recognizing the stagnation we face while charting a path forward driven by technological ingenuity and bold, optimistic visions for progress. Together, these works underscore the high aspirations and potential limitations inherent in this emerging narrative.

### Conclusion:
The discussion highlights a tension between **efficiency gains** (e.g., saving time, multilingual support) and concerns about **content quality and ethics**. While some see value in TrendlyAI’s research capabilities, skepticism about AI’s role in creative processes dominates the thread. The founder’s focus on positioning it as a supplement—not a replacement—for human insight aims to address these critiques but faces an uphill battle in a community wary of AI-driven content saturation.
