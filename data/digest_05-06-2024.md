#### [Submission URL](https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision) | 407 points | by [dsr_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dsr_) | [193 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40279632)

In a recent blog post on Hacker News, Cody Martin discusses a newly identified network technique, known as TunnelVision (CVE-2024-3661), that exposes a vulnerability in routing-based VPNs. By exploiting DHCP features, attackers can divert a user's traffic away from their VPN tunnel, allowing them to intercept unencrypted packets without triggering VPN kill switches. This technique, referred to as decloaking, poses a serious threat to user privacy and security.

Martin emphasizes the importance of disclosing this vulnerability to the broader security community and public due to its potential existence since 2002 and the significant impact it could have, especially on vulnerable groups like journalists and whistleblowers. While a mitigation method exists for Linux-based systems, it raises concerns about potential side channels for targeted attacks.

The suggested solution involves VPN providers implementing network namespaces to enhance security and protect users from such attacks. Martin delves into the fundamentals of networking, VPN technology, and DHCP to explain the decloaking process thoroughly, making the technical details accessible to a wide audience.

The post also acknowledges prior references to similar decloaking behavior on social media, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of this technique beyond the technology sector. Ultimately, the goal is to raise awareness and encourage VPN providers and operating system maintainers to take proactive measures to safeguard user data and privacy.

The discussion about the submission on Hacker News regarding the TunnelVision vulnerability in routing-based VPNs touched on various related topics:

1. **Poison Tap Attack**: There was a mention of Samy Kamkar's Poison Tap attack from 2016, where USB or Thunderbolt devices were used to divert specific routes and traffic preferences, potentially affecting VPN and firewall clients by manipulating traffic without triggering protections. NordVPN was highlighted as potentially vulnerable due to lacking basic firewall rules.

2. **VPN Providers and Security**: Concerns were raised about VPN providers and their practices, with discussions on the trustworthiness of commercial VPN solutions, marketing tactics, and the necessity of encryption in VPN services. The risks of VPNs complying with law enforcement requests and potential security compromises were also mentioned.

### Thorn in a HaizeStack test for evaluating long-context adversarial robustness

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/haizelabs/thorn-in-haizestack) | 17 points | by [leonardtang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leonardtang) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40276550)

The Thorn in a HaizeStack test is a new twist on the classic Needle in the Haystack evaluation method for testing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieving facts from long input contexts. Instead of the benign Needle text, Haize Labs introduces a provocative "Thorn" text to assess adversarial robustness. By increasing the input context length with the Thorn included, the test aims to reveal the model's vulnerabilities as well as capabilities.

The test setup involves prompting the model with a question like "What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?" and observing whether it retrieves the intended text or the adversarial Thorn text. The results of evaluating various models like Claude, GPT, and Command-R against the Thorn in a HaizeStack test can be visualized to understand their performance in handling long-context adversarial scenarios.

To run the Thorn in a HaizeStack Test, specify a model, context lengths, and insertion points for the Thorn text. After scoring the responses and visualizing the results, you can explore the test further and have fun experimenting with the content provided. Acknowledgements are extended to Greg Kamradt for the original Needle in a Haystack evaluation inspiration.

The comments on the submission discuss the importance and nuances of testing large language models (LLMs) like GPT against adversarial scenarios such as the Thorn in a HaizeStack Test. 

- **andy99** points out that dismissing alignment training might not be wise, as it could be essential in addressing the waste of time and effort caused by insufficiently limited resources, implying the need for reinforced external filters.
  
- **bllchmbrs** emphasizes the critical nature of integrity testing for AI. 

- **brfbggns** suggests that diverse LLMs are vital in safeguarding business processes against cybercriminals, indicating the importance of effectively dealing with adversarial scenarios through the use of advanced LLMs.
