### Language Modeling Is Compression

#### [Submission URL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2309.10668) | 26 points | by [haltist](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haltist) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37600376)

The featured paper on Hacker News today explores the connection between language modeling and lossless data compression. The authors argue that there is an equivalence between predictive modeling and compression, and that large language models like Transformers can serve as powerful compressors. They demonstrate that even language models trained primarily on text can achieve impressive compression rates on datasets like ImageNet images and LibriSpeech audio. However, the authors also note that model size plays a role in compression performance, and there is an optimal tradeoff between model size and dataset size. Tokenization is also discussed as a form of compression, with simpler tokenizers like ASCII leading to better compression rates. The paper concludes by highlighting that the prediction-compression equivalence allows any compressor to be used as a conditional generative model. Overall, the paper provides a compression viewpoint on language modeling and large models, shedding light on in-context learning, scaling laws, tokenization, and generation.

The discussion on Hacker News mainly revolves around the connections between language modeling and lossless data compression mentioned in the featured paper. One user expresses confusion about the relevance of the PAC learnability framework and its relationship to compression in the context of the paper. Another user suggests reviewing the Ergotic theory and PAC learnability to gain a better understanding of the topic.

There is a comment providing a direct link to the paper on arXiv, which is hosted on the HuggingFace website.
