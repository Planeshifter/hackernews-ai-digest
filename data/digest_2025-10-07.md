### Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/) | 582 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [292 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507936)

Google DeepMind released Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, a specialized variant of Gemini 2.5 Pro that can operate UIs by “clicking, typing, and scrolling” via the Gemini API. It’s aimed at building agents that handle unstructured, GUI-only workflows (forms, dropdowns, behind logins) rather than just calling APIs, and is available in preview in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

Key details:
- How it works: A new computer_use tool runs in a loop. You send a user request, a screenshot, and recent action history; the model returns a function call (e.g., click, type, scroll) or asks for user confirmation on risky steps (like purchases). Your client executes it, then returns a fresh screenshot/URL to continue until done.
- Capabilities: Optimized for web browser control; shows promise on mobile UI control; not yet tuned for desktop OS-level automation. Supports excluding certain actions and adding custom functions.
- Performance: Google reports it outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web/mobile control benchmarks, including Browserbase’s Online-Mind2Web harness, with lower latency. Results combine self-reported and third-party evaluations.
- Safety: Trained-in safeguards plus developer controls. An out-of-model per-step safety service vets each proposed action. System instructions let you require refusal or user confirmation for high-stakes actions. Restrictions include things like CAPTCHA bypassing, system integrity compromise, or controlling medical devices.
- Demos: Example tasks include migrating data between sites (with auth) and reorganizing a sticky-note board via drag-and-drop.

Why it matters: It pushes agentic UI control into mainstream developer tooling, competing with similar “computer use” efforts, with an emphasis on low-latency browser automation and layered safety guardrails.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Technical Comparisons & Automation Tools:**
   - Users discuss using Gemini with Chrome DevTools Protocol (MCP) for browser automation, contrasting it with tools like Playwright and Puppeteer. Some note MCP’s lower-level control but mention Playwright’s speed and simplicity for scripting.
   - Herd’s Trail system is highlighted as an alternative for browser automation, emphasizing distributed orchestration and REST-like APIs. Users debate whether Gemini’s approach offers novel advantages over existing frameworks.

2. **Wordle Example & Capabilities:**
   - A user successfully solved Wordle using Gemini, leveraging screenshots and grayscale analysis. However, others note inconsistencies, with Gemini sometimes failing to interpret feedback (green/yellow/gray letters) correctly.
   - ChatGPT’s struggles with Wordle are mentioned, including forgotten rules and reliance on keyboard layout mappings (e.g., Dvorak vs. QWERTY) to decode passwords, sparking debate about LLMs’ reliability for precise tasks.

3. **CAPTCHA & Security Concerns:**
   - Gemini’s ability to bypass CAPTCHAs is demonstrated (e.g., Google’s reCAPTCHA demo), raising ethical questions. Browserbase’s CAPTCHA-solving service is speculated to use low-cost human labor.
   - A security lapse in a demo video accidentally exposed sensitive strings (possibly API keys/passwords) in browser history, prompting warnings about data leakage risks during automation.

4. **Community Reactions:**
   - Mixed sentiments: Some praise Gemini’s low-latency performance and potential for complex workflows (e.g., drag-and-drop UI reorganization), while others criticize its occasional unreliability and “lazy” execution in resource-intensive tasks.
   - Humorous skepticism emerges around AI “solving” Wordle, with users joking about grayscale analysis being a “boring superpower.”

**Key Takeaways:**  
The discussion reflects cautious optimism about Gemini’s UI automation potential but underscores challenges in consistency, security, and ethical use. Comparisons to existing tools highlight trade-offs between flexibility and ease of use, while real-world demos reveal both promise and pitfalls.

### Less is more: Recursive reasoning with tiny networks

#### [Submission URL](https://alexiajm.github.io/2025/09/29/tiny_recursive_models.html) | 282 points | by [guybedo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=guybedo) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45506268)

- Tiny Recursion Model (TRM): a 7M-parameter, from-scratch model that iteratively refines its own answers via a simple recursion loop, reporting 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2.
- Core idea: “less is more.” Instead of scaling LLMs, TRM keeps a latent state z and, for each step, updates z multiple times from (x, y, z) before updating the answer y—allowing it to fix its own mistakes over K improvement steps.
- Positioning: Inspired by HRM (which hit ~40% on ARC-AGI-1) but claims a simpler design—no brain analogies, no fixed-point theorems, no hierarchy—while improving accuracy with far fewer parameters.
- Pitch: parameter-efficient recursive reasoning that aims to reduce overfitting and cost, challenging the notion that only massive foundation models can handle hard reasoning tasks.
- Links: Paper | Code

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Evaluation & Generalization Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism arises around HRM/TRM's evaluation on ARC-AGI benchmarks. Critics argue that training on small, specialized datasets risks overfitting, questioning whether the models truly generalize or exploit training-test data overlap.  
   - Comparisons to LLMs are deemed unfair, as LLMs are tested on broader datasets. The discussion emphasizes the need for strict separation of training and test data to validate claims of reasoning ability.  

2. **Technical Comparisons**:  
   - **Recursion vs. Transformers**: TRM’s recursion is likened to Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, enabling iterative refinement with fewer parameters, while traditional Transformers resemble Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters.  
   - **Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs)**: Mentioned as a related approach, DEQs achieve recursion-equivalent results via equilibrium points in a single layer, offering efficiency but facing scalability challenges.  

3. **Related Work**:  
   - Multiple papers on recursive architectures (e.g., Universal Transformers, Fixed Point Diffusion Models) are cited, showing prior exploration of iterative refinement. TRM’s approach parallels Chain-of-Thought reasoning but formalizes recursion explicitly.  

4. **Practicality vs. Hype**:  
   - While TRM’s simplicity and parameter efficiency are praised, critics caution against overhyping. HRM’s limited applicability beyond niche tasks (e.g., spatial reasoning in ARC-AGI) is noted, urging broader testing.  
   - A user’s replication of HRM suggests latent reasoning, not architecture, drives performance, challenging TRM’s novelty.  

5. **Community Call to Action**:  
   - Emphasis on replication, rigorous benchmarking, and exploring whether recursion’s benefits extend to real-world tasks. The debate underscores the need for transparent evaluation to distinguish true reasoning from data exploitation.  

**Key Takeaway**: TRM’s iterative refinement is a promising direction for efficient reasoning, but skepticism about evaluation methodologies and practical utility persists. The discussion highlights the community’s demand for robustness over hype, advocating for careful validation against diverse benchmarks.

### Launch HN: LlamaFarm (YC W22) – Open-source framework for distributed AI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm) | 100 points | by [mhamann](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mhamann) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45504388)

LlamaFarm: build RAG- and agent-driven apps locally in minutes, swap backends later

What it is
- An Apache-2.0, local-first framework with a single CLI (lf) to spin up chat, RAG pipelines, agents, datasets, and a production-style server. Opinionated defaults (Ollama + Chroma) but fully extensible to vLLM, OpenAI-compatible hosts, other vector stores, parsers, and embedders.

Why it stands out
- Config over code: projects are defined by YAML schemas validated at runtime; swap runtimes/stores without rewriting your app.
- OpenAI-compatible REST API at localhost:8000, so existing clients can point at it.
- Production parity: dev stack mirrors server endpoints; easy to version-control and deploy.
- Composable RAG: choose parsers, extractors, embeddings, DBs via config instead of bespoke orchestration.

Notable features
- CLI workflows: init, start (Docker services + dev chat UI), interactive chat TUI, one-off prompts, cURL preview, dataset create/upload/process, and semantic RAG queries with filters.
- Agents and pipelines out of the box; extendable backends and tooling.
- Runs locally today with Ollama; supports switching to hosted vLLM/Together or custom OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Getting started
- Requirements: Docker and Ollama (Windows CLI via winget). Tip: bump Ollama’s context window for long docs.
- Typical flow: lf init → lf start → lf chat; manage datasets and RAG via lf datasets ... and lf rag query ...

Caveats
- Local runtime alternatives beyond Ollama are still “coming soon”; defaults to Chroma; Docker required.

### Deloitte to refund the Australian government after using AI in $440k report

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/06/deloitte-to-pay-money-back-to-albanese-government-after-using-ai-in-440000-report) | 451 points | by [fforflo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fforflo) | [226 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45500485)

Deloitte to refund part of $440k Australian gov report after AI-linked citation errors

- Australia’s Department of Employment and Workplace Relations says Deloitte will repay the final instalment on a $440,000 review after multiple errors surfaced, including nonexistent references and a misdescription of a robodebt-related court case (Amato).
- Deloitte’s report, published 4 July and later amended, reviewed the department’s targeted compliance framework and IT system for welfare mutual obligations, finding issues like poor traceability to legislation and punitive default assumptions.
- After media scrutiny, Deloitte disclosed in an appendix that it used a DEWR-licensed Azure OpenAI GPT-4o toolchain in preparing parts of the report.
- University of Sydney academic Dr Christopher Rudge, who flagged the problems, said the report showed “hallucinations” and suggested some claims lacked a clear evidentiary source, though he didn’t dismiss the overall conclusions.
- Deloitte says the corrections don’t alter findings or recommendations and that the matter is resolved with the client.
- Labor senator Deborah O’Neill blasted the firm for a “human intelligence problem,” quipping that buyers might be better off with a ChatGPT subscription.

Why it matters: Governments are starting to push back on undisclosed or poorly governed AI use in high-stakes consulting work. Expect tighter procurement clauses on AI disclosure, stricter citation verification, and audit trails. For firms using LLMs, automated reference checking and retrieval-grounded workflows are becoming mandatory to avoid a “hallucination tax.”

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around Deloitte’s AI-linked errors in a $440k Australian government report, with participants critiquing consulting firms’ accountability, AI governance, and systemic industry flaws. Key themes include:

1. **Criticism of Consulting Practices**:  
   - Many users criticized Deloitte and similar firms for prioritizing profit over quality, labeling consultants as "highly motivated by money" but lacking accountability. Subcontracting practices were highlighted, with work often delegated to inexperienced teams, leading to degraded outcomes. Comparisons were drawn to scandals like Fujitsu’s Post Office debacle and the UK’s Royal Mail system failures.  
   - A recurring sentiment: Consulting reports are seen as "black-box" exercises, with deliverables designed to justify pre-determined conclusions rather than rigorous analysis. One user quipped, *"Deloitte might as well use ChatGPT subscriptions instead."*

2. **AI Governance and Hallucinations**:  
   - The incident underscored concerns about undisclosed AI use in high-stakes work. Participants called for stricter procurement rules, automated citation checks, and retrieval-augmented workflows to curb AI "hallucinations." The term "hallucination tax" emerged, reflecting the cost of errors when AI-generated content lacks verification.  
   - Some defended AI’s role but stressed transparency: *"The problem isn’t AI—it’s human oversight."*

3. **Broader Systemic Issues**:  
   - Users linked the debacle to systemic failures in government contracting, citing the **robodebt scandal** (where flawed algorithms wrongfully accused welfare recipients of debt) as a cautionary tale. Deloitte’s misdescription of this case in their report was seen as emblematic of a pattern where consultants overlook human impacts.  
   - Discussions also touched on outsourcing to firms like Infosys and WITCH companies (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, etc.), where quality often declines due to cost-cutting and subcontracting layers.

4. **Off-Topic but Notable**:  
   - A tangent on chiropractic practices and medical accountability emerged, drawing parallels to critiques of unregulated expertise. However, this was largely sidelined as irrelevant to the core discussion.

**Conclusion**: The incident highlights growing scrutiny of AI use in consulting and demands for accountability. Participants anticipate tighter regulations, better audit trails, and a shift toward transparency in both AI workflows and consulting practices. As one user noted, *"Governments are learning to stop writing blank checks for glossy, error-prone reports."*

### GPT-5-Codex is a better AI researcher than me

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-research-with-codex/) | 64 points | by [codeclimber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codeclimber) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45501326)

- The question: What’s the strongest model you can train on a laptop in five minutes?

- Setup: The author leans into “vibe research”—using an LLM (Codex/GPT‑5‑codex per the post) as a hands-on research assistant to iterate on code, run sweeps, and propose next steps. Work stayed on the TinyStories dataset for apples-to-apples comparisons.

- Process: A tight loop where Codex edits the training script, runs 3–4 experiments (~20 minutes), then suggests 2–3 next ideas; the author chooses and repeats. Heavy token use (restarting every ~1M tokens) on a $200/month plan. Ran in a permissive sandbox without MPS, so training was CPU-only; a few memory-caused laptop crashes but no runaway behavior.

- Experiments:
  - N-grams: 19 models; best was a 4‑gram with perplexity 18.5—fast to train but outputs read like stitched fragments with little global coherence.
  - Transformers: ~50 variants sweeping depth/heads/size. The best five-minute model was ~1.8M parameters. It produced simple, mostly coherent TinyStories-style text; Codex-guided runs beat the author’s solo baseline. Hand-picked hyperparameters from a prior attempt remained surprisingly competitive, roughly aligning with small-model scaling intuitions.

- Results (samples paraphrased): Outputs are childlike and mostly coherent but still prone to logical slips and odd phrasing—far from SOTA, yet respectable given the five‑minute, CPU‑bound constraint.

- Takeaways:
  - LLM-as-copilot makes amateur ML research feel tractable: easy hyperparameter sweeps, rapid iteration, decent idea generation.
  - The five-minute budget is the main bottleneck; compute access (no GPU) also capped performance.
  - Costs and token churn are nontrivial.
  - “Vibe research” works surprisingly well: the assistant often proposed the best ideas, with the human acting as curator and guardrails.

The Hacker News discussion on training AI models with LLM assistance reveals several key themes:

1. **Appreciation for Novelty & Accessibility**:  
   Commenters praised the experimental approach of using LLMs (like Codex) as a "vibe research" copilot, enabling rapid iteration even on a laptop CPU. The work’s accessibility for small teams or individuals, via affordable models like TinyStories, was seen as inspiring for amateur researchers and educators. However, some noted the $200/month API cost as a barrier.

2. **Technical Skepticism & Hype Critique**:  
   While impressed with the 5-minute training results, many questioned the hype around such "tiny models," emphasizing that outputs remain error-prone and far from SOTA. Skeptics argued the submission exemplified HN’s tendency to overhype incremental progress. Others debated whether LLM-assisted coding truly counts as "AI research" or is merely a productivity tool.

3. **Reliability Concerns in AI-Driven Research**:  
   Users shared frustrations with LLMs (like Claude) generating plausible but incorrect information, especially in sensitive domains like health/medicine. Reliance on Reddit-sourced training data was critiqued, with concerns about pseudoscience seeping into outputs. Some highlighted challenges in verifying sources and ensuring domain-specific reasoning.

4. **AI’s Role in Coding & Job Dynamics**:  
   The thread split between optimism for AI-assisted development ("lifting the floor" for non-experts) and warnings about unvetted code leading to "disasters." A subthread debated whether AI devalues traditional programming skills or simply automates grunt work, with anecdotes about shifting industry priorities and job market pressures.

5. **Humorous Meta-Comments**:  
   Lighthearted interjections included comparisons to xkcd comics, jokes about AGI timelines, and sarcastic takes on the "weekly AI hype cycle." Some users mockingly framed the submission as part of a broader trend of overcrediting AI over human input.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism about democratizing ML research via LLM tools and sharp critiques of technical limitations, costs, and community hype. Underlying tensions about AI’s role in reshaping research integrity and engineering careers persist.

#### [Submission URL](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/ai_art) | 50 points | by [ChrisMarshallNY](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ChrisMarshallNY) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507228)

Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal) published a long, illustrated essay-comic reflecting on AI image tools—what they’re good for, where they fall short, and how they intersect with the craft and livelihood of artists. It’s characteristically funny but largely measured, aiming to separate hype and fear from practical realities.

Highlights
- Nuanced tool-not-replacement stance: frames AI image models as accelerators for drafts, ideation, and explorations, while arguing taste, direction, and storytelling remain the scarce skills.
- Ethics and consent: surfaces unresolved questions about training on copyrighted work, style mimicry, and compensation—urging clearer attribution/licensing norms rather than hand-waving “fair use” over everything.
- Craft vs. output: distinguishes making from merely generating, and why many artists still value the process; also notes where current models struggle with coherent visual narratives.
- Practical guardrails: suggests common-sense boundaries for using AI in creative workflows and crediting collaborators, without absolutism.

Why it matters
- A mainstream, award-winning creator weighing in broadens the conversation beyond tech circles, blending hands-on experience with ethical concerns.
- Timely amid ongoing legal fights over training data and style emulation, and as more productions experiment with AI-assisted pipelines.

HN discussion themes
- Consent and compensation for training data; whether “style” can or should be protected.
- The line between inspiration and replication, and what credit looks like in mixed human–AI workflows.
- Economic impacts on illustrators vs. democratization of visual creation.
- Whether rapidly improving models narrow the gap on composition, continuity, and storytelling—or just make mediocre faster.

Bottom line
A readable, balanced take that neither glorifies nor condemns AI art wholesale; it’s about what creators value, how audiences judge authenticity, and the norms we still need to build.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around Matthew Inman’s (The Oatmeal) essay on AI art reflects a nuanced debate about creativity, ethics, and the role of technology in artistic workflows. Key themes include:

1. **Human vs. AI Creativity**:  
   - Many argue that AI lacks the intentionality, emotional depth, and "soul" of human art, emphasizing that meaningful choices and storytelling stem from lived experience. Users note AI’s tendency to produce "soulless" or "thoughtless" outputs, even as it accelerates ideation.  
   - Counterpoints highlight AI’s utility for entertainment, personal projects (e.g., quirky holiday cards), or overcoming creative blocks, though conceding it cannot replicate the refinement of tools like Photoshop or years of artistic craft.

2. **Effort and Authenticity**:  
   - Some users share experiences of spending hours refining AI-generated images, arguing that effort and curation still matter. Others push back, stating that AI’s speed risks devaluing the struggle inherent to traditional art, which resonates with audiences through its imperfections and humanity.  
   - Comparisons to AI-generated music (e.g., "robotic" vocals) underscore concerns about authenticity, with debates over whether audiences can distinguish—or care about—human vs. AI creation.

3. **Ethics and Economics**:  
   - Concerns about training data consent, style replication, and fair compensation persist. Some fear AI could marginalize artists economically, while others see democratization in lowering barriers to visual creation.  
   - A recurring tension exists between AI as a tool for efficiency and its potential to disrupt creative industries, with calls for clearer attribution norms and ethical guardrails.

4. **Technical Critique**:  
   - Critiques of Inman’s essay question his grasp of AI’s technical underpinnings (e.g., transformers, encoders), contrasting it with historical digital tools like Adobe Effects. Some defend AI’s potential in interactive media (e.g., game narratives) while lamenting its overuse in "glitchy" or derivative outputs.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:  
   - Users debate whether AI’s rise reflects a broader societal shift toward valuing speed over craftsmanship. The essay’s focus on "what creators value" sparks discussions about artistic integrity, audience expectations, and the evolving definition of art itself.

**Conclusion**: The discussion mirrors Inman’s balanced stance—acknowledging AI’s utility while stressing irreplaceable human elements. Skepticism about hype coexists with curiosity about AI’s role in future workflows, underscoring the need for ethical frameworks and respect for artistic labor.
