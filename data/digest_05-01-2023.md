### SIMD with Zig

#### [Submission URL](https://www.openmymind.net/SIMD-With-Zig/) | 147 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35782825)

In Zig, developers can use SIMD instructions to check multiple characters in a string in parallel to find the index of the first occurrence of a specific character. By creating vectors of 8 elements each and using the equality operator to compare them, developers can get a new vector of matches where the first true value corresponds to the index of the target character in the original string. Zig's std.simd.firstTrue function can be used to quickly extract this index. Additionally, the @select builtin can be used to select values from two vectors based on a vector of booleans, allowing developers to extract the index of the first true value in a vector of matches.

The comments debate the pros and cons of implementing these instructions, with some pointing out that the feature can increase performance while also admitting that it will require a lot of work. The discussion also touches on some features of Zig, such as its runtime vector width dispatch and multi-versioning function calls, and some consider potential downsides, such as the lack of support for certain hardware configurations. Finally, there is a discussion on the standard library functions in Zig and some find the naming conventions confusing. Overall, developers are interested in benchmarking the performance of this feature and wonder if it will provide significant benefits over traditional profiling.
