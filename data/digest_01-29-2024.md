### A Tinkertoy computer that plays tic-tac-toe (1989)

#### [Submission URL](https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215459/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu:80/~cfs/472_html/Intro/TinkertoyComputer/TinkerToy.html) | 34 points | by [anschwa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anschwa) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39176705)

A group of MIT students have built a computer entirely out of Tinkertoys that can play tic-tac-toe. The computer uses a read head to scan through 48 rows of Tinkertoy "memory spindles" to determine its next move. Each spindle represents a combination of X's and O's that could arise during the game. The computer is operated by a human who cranks the read head and adjusts the core piece inside it to register the opponent's moves. When the computer finds a memory that matches the current state of the game, it indicates its move. The students who built this Tinkertoy computer have since graduated, with one of them, Daniel Hillis, going on to found Thinking Machines, Inc., which produces the Connection Machine. The universality of computation in Tinkertoys is a fascinating concept, as Marvin Minsky noted in the preface to LogoWorks.

The discussion surrounding the submission includes several comments that provide additional information and context related to the concept of building computers out of Tinkertoys. 

- One user mentions that in 1982, a French magazine called Science Vie published a cardboard computer simulator named Ordinapoche, designed by Joel de Rosnay. They provide a link to the French version of the article.
- Another user notes that traditional toy computers made out of cardboard existed prior to the Tinkertoy computer, such as the Little Man Computer in 1965 and the CARDIAC (CARDboard Illustrative Aid to Computation) in 1968. They provide links to more information about these toy computers.
- A user shares a link to a collection by Computer History Museum, featuring Tinker Toy Logic circuits made out of TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic), indicating that more advanced versions of Tinkertoy computers were built using different materials.
- One user mentions that an article titled "Tinker Toy Computer" by AK Dewdney was featured in the "Computer Recreations" column, which was followed by Martin Gardner's "Mathematical Recreations" column in the same magazine. The user suggests that Dewdney's columns were later compiled into books.
- A user provides a link to an article about MENACE (Matchbox Educable Noughts and Crosses Engine) from the 1960s, which was another example of a toy computer that played noughts and crosses. Another user adds that MENACE was able to learn how to play tic-tac-toe after being given precomputed positions.

Overall, the discussion expands on the concept of building toy computers and provides additional resources and examples related to Tinkertoy computers and other similar projects.

Loic Hovon, a developer, has shared a project on Hacker News that allows for scraping larger and cheaper Street View images from the Google Maps JavaScript API. Despite acknowledging that this project goes against the Maps Platform's Terms of Service and may result in a ban or retribution, Hovon believes it is fair game for academic research purposes. The project provides the ability to gather multiple angles and different time periods for a location, as well as obtain arbitrarily sized images without watermarks. Hovon also includes the code and explains the process of using Selenium to load the JavaScript API and scrape the images. However, it's worth noting that this method may be slower than using the Static API and requires waiting between screenshots. Overall, the project offers a more cost-effective solution for collecting a streetview image dataset.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding Loic Hovon's project to scrape larger and cheaper Street View images from the Google Maps JavaScript API had a few different points of view. 

One user, "gnvl," expressed concern about the potential consequences of using unauthorized methods and violating Google's Terms of Service. They mentioned that Google can be very strict when it comes to banning users and imposing penalties.

Another user, "xnx," was surprised that scraping Street View images could be done through the API. They mentioned that in the past, people had to resort to using browser automation and taking screenshots to collect street view images.

In response, "KolmogorovComp" pointed out that using Selenium and injecting additional JavaScript code into the page could achieve the same result as the API. They provided a link to a blog post explaining version two of the scraper, which involves injecting additional JavaScript code.

"Xnx" admitted that they did not understand the technique described and asked for further clarification. Another user, "fshnc," chimed in and shared the fact that clicking through street views in a browser and taking screenshots had been done before in tools like Streetview Hyperlapse back in 2013.

A user named "dvt" highlighted the issue of cost when scraping Street View images from the Google Maps API. They mentioned that constantly scraping the API for a long period of time could result in being throttled or needing multiple IP addresses to bypass limitations.

In response, "mplws" mentioned that there are traditional scrapers specifically designed for the Panorama API, which can quickly scrape Google's property while also dealing with reCAPTCHAs.

Overall, the discussion included concerns about violating terms of service, surprise at the scraping methods, and considerations regarding cost and potential obstacles when using these techniques.
