#### [Submission URL](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent) | 168 points | by [l1n](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=l1n) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36406139)

DeepMind has created an AI agent called RoboCat, that learns to operate different robotic arms and perform a variety of tasks across different robots and self-generates new training data to improve its technique. The agent uses a multimodal model called Gato, which can process language, images, and actions in both simulated and physical environments. RoboCat learns much faster than other state-of-the-art models, as it can pick up a new task with as few as 100 demonstrations, reducing the need for human-supervised training. This is an important step towards creating a general-purpose robot.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.linen.dev/s/linen/t/12647025/building-a-slack-discord-alternative-with-tauri-rust) | 308 points | by [cheeseblubber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cheeseblubber) | [221 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36408633)

Linen, a search engine friendly alternative to Slack, has launched its Mac and Windows desktop clients using Tauri, a Rust-based Electron alternative. Tauri promises to yield smaller, more performant, and more secure desktop clients compared to Electron. While Tauri uses a Webview instead of chromium, Linen ran into compatibility challenges with NextJS and had to refactor all their code out of NextJS to a separate package to enable reuse between the NextJS app and the single page app Tauri built. Nonetheless, Linen was able to get a smooth developer experience on Tauri for the desktop, though it faced various challenges such as customizing the header and notification callbacks, among others. The Linux client suffered issues with fonts and emoji not building properly.

The submission is about Linen, a search engine-friendly alternative to Slack that has launched its Mac and Windows desktop clients using Tauri, a Rust-based Electron alternative. The discussion in the comments is centered around the comparison between Electron and Tauri, with some users defending Electron and stating that it works perfectly for them while others agree that Tauri is a more performant and secure alternative. The discussion also touches on the performance and resource usage of Electron versus other alternatives, as well as the issue of the increasing memory usage of modern software. Some users argue that the majority of people care about productivity and fast, snappy programs rather than high school dropouts, and that today's software runs worse on modern hardware while others disagree and say that today's engineers focus on UX features rather than actual performance.

### Predicting hit songs with 97% accuracy

#### [Submission URL](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2023.1154663/full) | 96 points | by [geox](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geox) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36403334)

A team of researchers from Claremont Graduate University and Immersion Neuroscience has developed a machine learning model that can predict hit songs based on neurophysiological responses. Traditional methods of identifying hit songs involve measuring song elements from large databases, but the team took a different approach by measuring responses to a set of songs provided by a streaming music service. They found that a linear statistical model using two neural measures identified hits with 69% accuracy, while a machine learning model classified hit songs with 97% accuracy. The results demonstrate that applying machine learning to neural data can substantially increase classification accuracy for difficult-to-predict market outcomes.

Today, the UC Berkeley team introduced vLLM, an open-source library for fast LLM inference and serving. This library promises to serve LLM models fast, cheaply, and efficiently, even for small research teams with limited compute resources. The team achieved up to 24x higher throughput than HuggingFace Transformers, the most popular LLM library, and up to 3.5x higher throughput than the previous state of the art, HuggingFace Text Generation Inference (TGI), in their experiments. This breakthrough was due to the library's cutting-edge attention algorithm, PagedAttention, which allows for efficient management of the large and dynamic key-value cache necessary for autoregressive decoding. PagedAttention also enabled efficient memory sharing, making complex sampling algorithms practical for LLM services. The library is already deployed at Chatbot Arena and Vicuna Demo and is available on GitHub.

### Representing Enums in PostgreSQL

#### [Submission URL](https://making.close.com/posts/native-enums-or-check-constraints-in-postgresql) | 109 points | by [wojcikstefan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wojcikstefan) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36403087)

In a recent discussion, the Close team debated whether to use native enums or string columns with CHECK constraints in PostgreSQL. They ultimately decided on the latter due to the limitations of enums (e.g., difficulty removing values) and the flexibility of CHECK constraints. String columns with CHECK constraints lend themselves well to enforcing data correctness in the database and make updating constraints in complex cases more manageable. However, this approach can be less space-efficient as the actual values are stored in the tuples themselves. The alternative of using native enums also has options for updating constraints without locking, but they are too complicated for most use cases and carry a higher risk of corrupting the database.

### Emerging architectures for LLM applications

#### [Submission URL](https://a16z.com/2023/06/20/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/) | 239 points | by [makaimc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=makaimc) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36409489)

this post, we introduce a reference architecture for the emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) application stack. The stack is a collection of systems, tools, and design patterns that can be used to build applications with LLMs, a powerful new primitive for building software. The design pattern we're looking at in-depth here is called in-context learning, which involves controlling LLM behavior through clever prompting and conditioning on private contextual data. This design pattern is easy to use and outperforms fine-tuning for relatively small datasets. The stack is early and will likely change, but we hope it will be useful for developers working with LLMs now.

### Show HN: Smolex â€“ A code retrieval ChatGPT Plugin for Python

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/loladotdev/smolex) | 14 points | by [Livioso](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Livioso) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36401719)

Smolex is an experimental code retrieval ChatGPT plugin that allows for more natural conversations about code. The plugin creates embeddings for all code in the codebase and stores them locally. It also AST parses all code and stores that in a local SQLite database. When a user asks a question, Smolex looks up the requested code in the database and either returns the entire code or a summary of the code. If there is no match in the database, it uses the vector store to find the code (or interface) that might be most relevant to the question. Smolex is Python only but can extend it to other languages.

The first comment by user "lgs" suggests that they have not had time to try out Smolex yet but may give it a try in the future. The comment also mentions a requirement file that includes a reference to "llama_index". Another user, "Livioso", thanks "lgs" for their comment.

The second comment by user "znhd" expresses optimism about Smolex and suggests that it would be interesting to see it as a VSCode extension. Livioso responds by saying that Smolex is currently a temporary solution until GitHub Copilot Chat becomes publicly available.

### GPS alternative taps cosmic rays for underground or underwater navigation

#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/technology/gps-alternative-muon-cosmic-rays-underground-underwater-navigation/) | 49 points | by [wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36402086)

Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a proof-of-concept navigation system called the muometric wireless navigation system (MuWNS) that uses cosmic rays to track movement underground and underwater with precision of a few metres. Unlike GPS, which bounces signals off rocks, walls, and water, MuWNS tracks particles called muons that pass through solid materials. The particles are generated when cosmic rays enter the Earthâ€™s atmosphere and produce a cascade of secondary particles. By tracking the paths of muons picked up by reference stations and a handheld detector, the scientists were able to trace the scientist's position with a high degree of precision deep inside a multi-story building.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the practicality and potential use cases of muon-based navigation systems. One user points out that the technology is currently expensive and difficult to implement in real-time applications. Another user questions the need for real-time tracking in underground or underwater scenarios and suggests that a stable recording receiver may be more practical. The potential of using the technology in microchip and commercial manufacturing is also discussed, as well as the limitations of the technology in areas without consistent connection. Finally, a user comments on a related underwater experiment in Newfoundland.
