#### [Submission URL](https://www.deepmind.com/blog/robocat-a-self-improving-robotic-agent) | 168 points | by [l1n](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=l1n) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36406139)

DeepMind has created an AI agent called RoboCat, that learns to operate different robotic arms and perform a variety of tasks across different robots and self-generates new training data to improve its technique. The agent uses a multimodal model called Gato, which can process language, images, and actions in both simulated and physical environments. RoboCat learns much faster than other state-of-the-art models, as it can pick up a new task with as few as 100 demonstrations, reducing the need for human-supervised training. This is an important step towards creating a general-purpose robot. Commenters discussed the high costs of building robotic platforms and the difficulties of controlling motors using torque. There was also a debate about the limitations of UI automation tools and the hostility towards the automation sector.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.linen.dev/s/linen/t/12647025/building-a-slack-discord-alternative-with-tauri-rust) | 308 points | by [cheeseblubber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cheeseblubber) | [221 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36408633)

Linen, a search engine friendly alternative to Slack, has launched its Mac and Windows desktop clients using Tauri, a Rust-based Electron alternative. Tauri promises to yield smaller, more performant, and more secure desktop clients compared to Electron. While Tauri uses a Webview instead of chromium, Linen ran into compatibility challenges with NextJS and had to refactor all their code out of NextJS to a separate package to enable reuse between the NextJS app and the single page app Tauri built. Nonetheless, Linen was able to get a smooth developer experience on Tauri for the desktop, though it faced various challenges such as customizing the header and notification callbacks, among others. The Linux client suffered issues with fonts and emoji not building properly.

The discussion in the comments is centered around the comparison between Electron and Tauri, with some users defending Electron and stating that it works perfectly for them while others agree that Tauri is a more performant and secure alternative. The discussion also touches on the performance and resource usage of Electron versus other alternatives, as well as the issue of the increasing memory usage of modern software. Some users argue that the majority of people care about productivity and fast, snappy programs rather than high school dropouts, and that today's software runs worse on modern hardware while others disagree and say that today's engineers focus on UX features rather than actual performance.

### Predicting hit songs with 97% accuracy

#### [Submission URL](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2023.1154663/full) | 96 points | by [geox](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geox) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36403334)

A team of researchers from Claremont Graduate University and Immersion Neuroscience has developed a machine learning model that can predict hit songs based on neurophysiological responses. Traditional methods of identifying hit songs involve measuring song elements from large databases, but the team took a different approach by measuring responses to a set of songs provided by a streaming music service. They found that a linear statistical model using two neural measures identified hits with 69% accuracy, while a machine learning model classified hit songs with 97% accuracy. The results demonstrate that applying machine learning to neural data can substantially increase classification accuracy for difficult-to-predict market outcomes. Some commenters pointed out problems with the small sample size and lack of diversity in songs used for the study, making the results less reliable. Others discussed the importance of properly validating synthetic datasets and the limitations of evaluation metrics like accuracy in imbalanced datasets. Finally, there was a discussion on the music industry and how difficult it is for independent artists and music genres outside of the mainstream to be represented on Billboard's charts.

### GPS alternative taps cosmic rays for underground or underwater navigation

#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/technology/gps-alternative-muon-cosmic-rays-underground-underwater-navigation/) | 49 points | by [wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36402086)

Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a proof-of-concept navigation system called the muometric wireless navigation system (MuWNS) that uses cosmic rays to track movement underground and underwater with precision of a few metres. Unlike GPS, which bounces signals off rocks, walls, and water, MuWNS tracks particles called muons that pass through solid materials. The particles are generated when cosmic rays enter the Earthâ€™s atmosphere and produce a cascade of secondary particles. By tracking the paths of muons picked up by reference stations and a handheld detector, the scientists were able to trace the scientist's position with a high degree of precision deep inside a multi-story building.

One user points out that the technology is currently expensive and difficult to implement in real-time applications. Another user questions the need for real-time tracking in underground or underwater scenarios and suggests that a stable recording receiver may be more practical. The potential of using the technology in microchip and commercial manufacturing is also discussed, as well as the limitations of the technology in areas without consistent connection. Finally, a user comments on a related underwater experiment in Newfoundland.
