#### [Submission URL](https://foojay.io/today/indexing-all-of-wikipedia-on-a-laptop/) | 451 points | by [tjake](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tjake) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40514266)

The project featured on Hacker News today is about indexing all of Wikipedia, which is now made possible on a laptop thanks to a public dataset released by Cohere in November. The dataset, chunked and embedded into vectors, allows individuals to create a semantic, vector-based index of Wikipedia efficiently for the first time.

The challenge in indexing such a vast dataset lies in the limitations of off-the-shelf vector databases, which traditionally couldn't handle datasets larger than memory during index construction. However, JVector, the library powering DataStax Astra vector search, now supports indexing larger-than-memory datasets by using compressed vectors, enabling the indexing of Wikipedia on a laptop.

For those interested in trying it out, the project requires Linux or MacOS, about 180GB of free space for the dataset, and 90GB for the completed index, along with sufficient RAM to run a JVM with 36GB of heap space during construction. The process involves setting up the project, downloading the dataset, building the index, and then searching the completed index using JVector for the vector index and Chronicle Map for the article data.

The detailed steps and technical aspects of the project, along with the code snippets and explanations, provide a comprehensive guide for those keen on exploring this indexing endeavor. Overall, this initiative opens up new possibilities for personal indexing projects with large datasets, making complex operations more accessible to individual users.

Here is a summary of the discussion on the Hacker News submission about indexing all of Wikipedia on a laptop using the Cohere dataset and JVector library:

1. The conversation started with a comparison between JVector and DiskANN libraries for indexing larger-than-memory datasets. JVector was commended for its incremental vector compression during index construction, while DiskANN was noted for partitioning vectors into smaller indexes built in-memory before merging results.
2. The discussion also touched upon DiskANN supporting PQ build-time vector compression for better benchmarking performance with efficient SIMD execution, and JVector maintaining accuracy with a compression approach that keeps distance lists in memory.
3. Additionally, there was discourse regarding Cohere's pricing for creating vector embeddings of the English Wikipedia dataset, with suggestions of potential cost savings using lightweight pre-trained models.
4. Further exchanges delved into the technical aspects of splitting article vectors into chunks for efficient indexing, the challenges of chunking algorithms, and suggestions for RoPE embeddings and context length in text processing.
5. The conversation also included information on the practicalities of running these indexing projects on laptops, potential cost estimates for competitions, and considerations for hosting the datasets for such endeavors.

Overall, the comments provided insights into the technical nuances, performance optimizations, cost considerations, and practical implementations related to indexing large datasets like Wikipedia using modern libraries and techniques.

### Training is not the same as chatting: LLMs don’t remember everything you say

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/) | 196 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40510668)

Simon Willison’s latest blog post dives into the misconception surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT regarding how "training" works. One common concern is users hesitating to interact with these tools out of fear of contributing to their training data. However, it's important to understand that LLMs, including ChatGPT, do not directly learn and memorize everything you say to them. They operate as stateless functions, treating each conversation as a separate entity without carrying forward memories from previous interactions.

Willison explains that starting a new chat conversation is akin to wiping the model's short-term memory clean, ensuring that each chat session is independent. Therefore, efforts to "train" the model by providing additional information during interactions are futile as the model resets with each new conversation. The concept of "context length" becomes crucial, dictating how much of the conversation the model can consider at a given time.

The idea of "training" in the realm of LLMs refers to the initial process of building these models through massive datasets, including vast amounts of text from various sources like Wikipedia, web scrapping, books, and more. It involves exhaustive pre-training to identify patterns in language and subsequent phases to refine the model's conversational abilities. Once trained, the model remains static, only occasionally undergoing updates that are distributed uniformly across servers.

Despite assurances that LLMs like ChatGPT do not directly train on user input, concerns about data usage persist due to vague terms and conditions allowing model improvements based on user interactions. The complexity lies in deciphering how providers utilize user data for enhancing their models, raising questions about data privacy and security.

Willison's insightful analysis sheds light on the nuances of LLMs' functioning, emphasizing the need for a clear understanding of how these models operate and how training processes shape their conversational capabilities.

The discussion on Hacker News around Simon Willison's blog post about Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT involved various viewpoints and clarifications. Some users emphasized that these models do not instantly remember all interactions, as each chat session operates independently without carrying memories from previous conversations. Others mentioned the technical aspects of training support points and the misconception of users believing the models instantly retain all information provided to them.

Additionally, there were discussions about potential misconceptions regarding human-like interactions with AI models and the expectations of memory retention. Some users highlighted the distinctions between different types of models, such as ChatGPT-the-model and ChatGPT-the-service, and the importance of correctly understanding and utilizing LLMs in product testing and development.

Furthermore, there were insights shared about the complexity and risks associated with the continuous improvement of AI models through training with external data sources. Some users raised concerns about potential risks of model crashes and the ongoing need for human oversight and intervention in the incremental training process of these models.
