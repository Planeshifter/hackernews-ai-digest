### Aurora I/O optimized config saved 90% DB cost

#### [Submission URL](https://graphite.dev/blog/how-an-aws-aurora-feature-cut-db-costs) | 128 points | by [fosterfriends](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fosterfriends) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37079909)

In a recent blog post, Greg Foster, the CTO of a company called Graphite, shared how a new feature of AWS Aurora helped them reduce their database costs by 90%. Graphite's data is stored on Amazon Aurora Postgres, and due to their bidirectional sync with GitHub, their database load is larger than usual for a startup of their size. This was resulting in high costs, with Aurora accounting for over 80% of their AWS bill. 

Initially, they explored using Aurora Serverless to reduce costs by only paying for capacity consumed. However, their constant ingestion of updates from GitHub required a large instance size, which made it more expensive than using a fixed size instance. They were also not in need of automatic upscaling and downscaling capabilities.

Then, in May, AWS released a new feature called "Aurora I/O Optimized" that directly addressed their high I/O costs. It offered up to 40% cost savings by charging a slightly higher storage rate but no I/O charges. After migrating to I/O Optimized, Graphite saw a whopping 90% reduction in costs.

The migration process was straightforward, which involved converting existing clusters with a few clicks in the console, using the CLI, or AWS's SDK. When they reached out to AWS to find out why this feature was built, they discovered that the Aurora team wanted to enable more customers to run heavier I/O workloads without worrying about the costs.

Foster concludes the blog post by encouraging readers to monitor their AWS bills, experiment with cost optimization, and stay updated on new features and updates from their database provider.

### MetaGPT: Meta Programming for Multi-Agent Collaborative Framework

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00352) | 146 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [79 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37076125)

Researchers have developed a framework called MetaGPT that enhances multi-agent collaboration by incorporating efficient human workflows. The framework encodes Standardized Operating Procedures (SOPs) into prompts, enabling structured coordination and minimizing compounded errors. By assigning diverse roles to different agents, the framework improves the generation of coherent and correct solutions for complex problems. In experiments on collaborative software engineering, MetaGPT outperformed existing chat-based multi-agent systems. This approach demonstrates the potential of integrating human domain knowledge into multi-agent systems to address real-world challenges effectively. The research paper and GitHub repository are publicly available for further exploration.

The discussion surrounding this submission on Hacker News brings up several points. 

One user expresses skepticism about the ability of multi-agent AI systems to replace experienced professionals, arguing that intelligence is not solely based on the power of multiple individuals. They suggest that the challenge lies in solving problems that require higher quality intelligence, rather than relying on lower power agents. Another user raises the issue of the feasibility of utilizing multiple high school-level AI agents for complex problem-solving, highlighting the importance of considering the capabilities and expertise of the agents involved. 

Another user posits that the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) is limited due to their attention span. They suggest that the attention mechanism in LLMs could be improved to enable multiple assessments and requests for complete pictures, thereby providing consistent attention to nested problems. 

The debate continues with some users discussing the difference between a large language model and actual intelligence, emphasizing that a large language model pretends to be multiple individuals rather than having the genuine intelligence and perspective of multiple people. The discussion also touches on the benefits and limitations of LLMs, including their ability to recall information, their exposure to different contexts, and their computational limitations. 

Additionally, there is a discussion about the possibility of GPT-4 being a mixture of experts (MoE) model with eight experts, similar to a multi-agent setup. However, one user clarifies that a MoE is an ensemble of experts within a single network, rather than a truly multi-agent setup. 

Overall, the discussion provides different perspectives on the capabilities and limitations of multi-agent AI systems and large language models, highlighting the complexity of integrating human domain knowledge into these systems effectively.

### Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior, Now Open Source

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/joonspk-research/generative_agents) | 164 points | by [sirobg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sirobg) | [52 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37073938)

Introducing "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior"

A research paper titled "Generative Agents: Interactive Simulacra of Human Behavior" explores the development of computational agents that simulate believable human behaviors. This repository contains the core simulation module for generative agents and their game environment. 

To set up the simulation environment on your local machine, you need to generate a `utils.py` file with your OpenAI API key and install the necessary packages listed in `requirements.txt`. Once set up, you can run a simulation by starting two servers: the environment server and the agent simulation server. The environment server is implemented as a Django project, and you can start it by running `python manage.py runserver` in the `environment/frontend_server` directory. The simulation server can be started by running `python reverie.py` in the `reverie/backend_server` directory. 

The research paper and repository provide detailed instructions on how to run and customize simulations, load agent history, and create new base simulations. If you're interested in exploring generative agents and simulating human behaviors, this research and accompanying code can be a valuable resource.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the capabilities and limitations of generative agents or AI models like GPT-4.

One commenter points out that while GPT-4 may be good at playing chess and solve quadratics, it still struggles with simple arithmetic. Another commenter mentions that GPT-4 is even able to score in the 89th percentile on the SAT Math section. However, someone else points out that the SAT Math test mainly involves multiple-choice questions and reverse-engineered multiplication, which GPT-4 is well-suited for.

Another thread of discussion focuses on the definition of intelligence and whether GPT-4 and similar models can be considered intelligent. Some argue that comparing computers to humans based on specific tasks is not fair, while others suggest that current AI technologies enhance existing capabilities but do not possess true intelligence.

There is also a discussion about the potential use of generative agents in video games, particularly in powering NPC enemies. One commenter suggests that AI models like GPT-4 could be used to generate dynamic interactions and behavior for non-playable characters, enhancing the gaming experience.

Lastly, there is a debate on the limitations and challenges of procedural generation in game development. Some commenters mention that while procedural generation can create random and dynamic elements in games, it often lacks control and can result in unbalanced gameplay. They argue that using AI models for generating dialogues and content could be a solution, but it would require careful design and testing to ensure a good player experience.
