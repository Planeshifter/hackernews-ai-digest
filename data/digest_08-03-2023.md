Sweep: An AI Junior Developer that Automates Bug Fixes and Feature Requests

Sweep is an AI junior developer that aims to streamline the process of addressing bug reports and implementing new features. Unlike other AI solutions like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT, Sweep handles the entire development flow end-to-end, from reading the codebase to planning the changes and writing a pull request with code.

The unique aspect of Sweep is that it can directly transform bug reports and feature requests into pull requests without the need for an IDE. Developers can describe bugs, small features, and refactors to Sweep just as they would to a junior developer, and it takes care of the rest.

Sweep leverages embedding-based code search and supports all languages that GPT-4 supports, including Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Rust, Go, Java, C#, and C++. It also addresses developer replies and comments on its pull requests and can handle multiple tickets in parallel.

However, there are some limitations to be aware of. Sweep may struggle with large-scale refactors involving more than three files or more than 150 lines of code changes. It may also have trouble with using the latest APIs that have changed after 2022. Additionally, non-text assets like images cannot be edited using Sweep, and it cannot access external APIs or fetch API tokens.

Sweep is powered by GPT-4 32k 0613 and uses ActiveLoop DeepLake for Vector DB with MiniLM L12 as the embeddings model. The infra and deployment are handled by Modal Labs.

Sweep offers unlimited GPT3.5 tickets to every user and provides five GPT4 credits, which are used when a pull request is created. For professionals who require more tickets and priority support/feature requests, there is a Sweep Pro option available.

If you're interested in trying out Sweep, you can install the Sweep GitHub app and add it to your desired repositories. Contributions to the project are also welcome.

Overall, Sweep aims to make the process of addressing bugs and implementing features more efficient by automating repetitive tasks and reducing the need for manual coding.

The discussion on this submission mainly revolves around the capabilities and limitations of Sweep, as well as the practicality and potential impact of an AI junior developer.
