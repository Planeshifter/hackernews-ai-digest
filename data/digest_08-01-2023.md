### Room-Temperature Ambient-Pressure Superconductor LK-99 preprint revision 2

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12037) | 475 points | by [lnyan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lnyan) | [285 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36952894)

Scientists have discovered a new superconductor, Pb$_{10-x}$Cu$_x$(PO$_4$)$_6$O, which demonstrates levitation at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. The material, nicknamed LK-99, exhibits the characteristic of Ohmic metal and the Meissner effect of a superconductor below its superconducting critical temperature, $T_c$. The researchers attribute the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in LK-99 to two factors: the volume contraction resulting from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural deformation in the one-dimensional chain structure. The findings contribute to the understanding of superconductivity and may have implications for the development of new technology.

The discussion on this submission includes various comments regarding the credibility and replication of the results presented in the video. Some users express skepticism about the validity of the levitation demonstration and question the quality of the sample used. One user provides a translation of the comments in the video, suggesting that the levitation behavior shown may be due to paramagnetic properties rather than true levitation resulting from superconductivity. 
Other users discuss the practical applications and potential impact of room-temperature superconductivity. There are also comments discussing the challenges of reproducing experiments and the need for rigorous scientific evidence to support extraordinary claims. One user humorously suggests that the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity is akin to finding a pink cat in a jungle, emphasizing the need for robust evidence. Overall, there is a mix of skepticism, curiosity, and discussion about the plausibility and significance of the findings.

### Why This AI Moment May Be the Real Deal

#### [Submission URL](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-this-ai-moment-may-be-the-real-deal) | 140 points | by [_delirium](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_delirium) | [218 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36951809)

For years, the tech world has been skeptical of the promises made by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite impressive achievements and the creation of valuable wealth, AI often seemed limited, relying on human intervention behind the scenes. However, a new AI moment has arrived, and it may just be the real deal.

In this essay, the author explores the features of the new transformer paradigm and why it defies past skepticism. The essay begins with a reference to Joseph Weizenbaum, the pioneer of AI who warned about the public's susceptibility to believing that AI systems possess intelligence, even when they don't. This phenomenon, known as the man-behind-the-curtain effect, raises questions about the true capabilities of AI.

The author then reflects on their experience as a computer science student, where the potential of AI seemed tantalizingly close. However, the reality was different. The state of the art was neural nets, but they were only good at solving basic pattern-matching problems. While they could be tuned, they lacked true responsiveness and grasp. This left many skeptical about the grand promises of AI.

Acknowledging the solid ground for skepticism, the author highlights that past AI moments have often fallen short. However, the new AI moment, characterized by the transformer paradigm (such as ChatGPT and Midjourney), presents a different picture. While some may see consciousness or sentience in these AI systems, the reality is that they are still limited and far from true intelligence.

Despite these limitations, the new AI moment has garnered attention for its potential to surpass previous achievements. The transformer paradigm represents a shift in AI technology, displaying enhanced capabilities that seem more aligned with true intelligence. While skepticism should still remain, there is a growing sense that AI may finally be on the path to fulfilling its promises.

Overall, the essay makes a compelling case for why the current AI moment might be the real deal. With the transformer paradigm pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, there is hope that we are witnessing a significant step forward in the field of artificial intelligence.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of AI and its potential, as well as debates regarding consciousness and intelligence. Here are some key points from the conversation:

- Some users argue that AI systems, including those based on the transformer paradigm, are not truly intelligent or conscious but are rather sophisticated pattern-matching machines.
- There is a debate about whether consciousness and free will can be replicated in AI systems or if they are unique to humans.
- The discussion also touches on the problem of defining and measuring intelligence and consciousness, with some users suggesting that they are subjective experiences that cannot be empirically tested.
- Others express concerns about the implications of advanced AI systems and the potential challenges they may present to human society.
- There is a disagreement about the feasibility of AI systems achieving self-awareness and true intelligence, with some users pointing out the limitations of current AI technology.

Overall, the discussion reflects a range of opinions and perspectives on the current state and future potential of AI, as well as the philosophical questions surrounding consciousness and intelligence.
