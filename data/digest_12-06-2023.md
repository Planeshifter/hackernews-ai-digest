### How to create an AI narrator for your life

#### [Submission URL](https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ai-narrator) | 32 points | by [Charlieholtz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Charlieholtz) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38550486)

In a recent viral video, an AI clone of Sir David Attenborough narrated a man's everyday activities, bringing a touch of whimsy and humor to the mundane. Inspired by this, the video's creator shared how to create your own AI narrator for your life. The process involves using three AI models: a vision model that can "see" through your computer camera and describe what it sees, a language model that generates the script in the style of your chosen narrator, and a text-to-speech model that gives the script a spoken audio output.

To "see" through your camera, you can use the Llava 13B model, which is cheap and fast, or the GPT-4-Vision model, which is smarter but slightly slower and more expensive. These models take images and text prompts as inputs and provide text responses about the image. 
To feed images to the vision model, you can use your computer's webcam. You'll need a script that takes a photo from the webcam every few seconds and saves it to a file. Downsizing the images will make it faster and cheaper for the vision model to process.
For generating the script, you can use a language model like Mistral 7B. You can prompt the model to write a script in the style of your chosen narrator, using the output from the vision model as the description. Limiting the maximum tokens returned will ensure faster response times.
Finally, you'll need a text-to-speech model to give the script a spoken audio output. The aim is to make it sound natural and not robotic. By following these steps, you can create your own AI narrator to add a touch of creativity and entertainment to your daily life.

So, why not embrace the magic of AI and let an AI narrator bring your everyday activities to life in a fun and whimsical way?

The discussion surrounding the submission includes several comments:
- User "krdlssgn" shares a link to a GitHub repository that replicates the style of Sir David Attenborough's narration using OpenAI's models. They provide instructions on how to download the JSON file and import the pipeline using MittaAI.
- User "msingh_5" expresses concern about installing cameras at home, particularly in the kitchen and front door areas, due to privacy issues. They mention that they would rather use reminders for tasks like cooking chicken or bringing shopping bags or an umbrella based on weather updates and calendar events.
- User "crtvnl" criticizes the idea, calling it a shameless and negligent way of promoting a particular company under the guise of a creative project.
- User "Borrible" suggests an alternative to using AI narration, mentioning a service called SupernannAI, which offers a more centralized and flexible voice-over solution. They also jokingly mention the Spanish Inquisition.
- User "dr" expresses enjoyment in running video deep fakes in real-time.

- User "Charlieholtz" humorously agrees with the concept and mentions that it could be a fun way to play with the models.

In a recent blog post, Corey Quinn discusses AWS's (de)Generative AI blunder and how it has further fueled the perception that AWS is lagging behind in the Generative AI space. At the recent re:Invent 2023 event, AWS made 22 GenAI-related announcements, but half of them are still in preview. This indicates that many of these announcements were rushed and developed hastily since the release of ChatGPT a year ago. Quinn argues that this obsession with GenAI has distracted AWS from addressing more pressing customer challenges. One particular aspect of AWS's GenAI extravaganza that Quinn highlights is the introduction of Amazon Q, a catchall brand that encompasses coding assistance, chatbots, and natural language processing interfaces. However, the implementation of Amazon Q has been problematic. The chatbot, which shows up on every AWS page load, often provides false information and displays poor knowledge of AWS services. Quinn even points out instances where Amazon Q gave incorrect recommendations regarding AWS instance choices. Despite these flaws, AWS has given Amazon Q prominent placement and promotion. Other users have also reported receiving incorrect answers from Amazon Q on various topics. Overall, Quinn believes that AWS's rush to GenAI has resulted in a violation of its own leadership principles and a failure to meet customer expectations. On the positive side, given Amazon Q's presence and positioning, it may be seen as an official statement on behalf of AWS, which is an upgrade over Amazon's own public relations. Ultimately, ChatGPT still remains the dominant force in the Generative AI space.
