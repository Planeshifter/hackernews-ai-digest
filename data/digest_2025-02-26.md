Today on Hacker News, a curious discussion is bubbling around a GitHub repository named "vlmrun-cookbook." With an eye-catching 211 stars and 5 forks, this project seems to be garnering attention from the programming community. However, some users have encountered difficulties in navigating the repository's interface due to frequent session reload prompts, suggesting issues with browser interactions or GitHub's handling of session data.

The focal point of this repository is the "01_schema_showcase.ipynb" file, weighing in at 6.5 MB. While the specifics of the project are not immediately clear, the size and structure suggest a comprehensive Jupyter Notebook file potentially filled with code, data, and interactive elements.

This repository highlights an often-overlooked aspect of collaborative coding platforms—account session management can disrupt workflow, as noted by the frustration expressed in repeated prompts to reload sessions. This challenge underscores the importance of seamless user experience in cloud-based development environments.

For developers intrigued by the intersection of data science and collaborative coding, or those merely fascinated by GitHub's user interface idiosyncrasies, the "vlmrun-cookbook" offers both a technical deep dive and a practical lesson in online collaboration etiquette.

The discussion revolves around the use of **traditional OCR vs. vision-language models (VLMs/LLMs)** for text recognition, focusing on accuracy, confidence metrics, and practical challenges:

### Key Points:
1. **OCR Limitations**:  
   - Traditional OCR struggles with **complex layouts** (tables, headers, financial statements) and **low-confidence text** (e.g., gibberish, handwritten notes).  
   - Errors often stem from layout parsing, not just character recognition.  

2. **VLM/LLM Strengths & Weaknesses**:  
   - **Pros**: VLMs report **confidence scores** (e.g., 70–95%) to flag uncertain text, handle contextual inference, and parse structured data (JSON/Pydantic) to reduce "hallucinations" (incorrect outputs).  
   - **Cons**: Confidence scores don’t fully resolve reliability issues. LLMs can still hallucinate (**“ddctrs hndwrtng”** as a gag) and struggle with ambiguous inputs like poor-quality scans (**“Xerox copier flaw”** example).  

3. **Human Review & Workflow**:  
   - **Confidence thresholds** (e.g., rejecting documents with scores <0.90) are debated. Some argue human review is impractical for all low-confidence cases, while others stress its necessity for critical fields like healthcare or legal documents.  

4. **Technical Solutions**:  
   - **Hybrid approaches**: Combine OCR with layout-aware models (e.g., LayoutLM) or multi-model ensembles (Gemini, GPT-4o) for redundancy.  
   - **Structured outputs**: Using JSON schemas or Pydantic constraints to enforce defects and reduce defects.  
   - **Open-source tools**: LayoutLM for token classification, Llamaparse for PDF parsing, and LLMWhisperer for preserving document layouts during extraction.  

5. **Cost & Feasibility**:  
   - Running multiple models per document/page is **expensive** but mitigated by modern multi-modal models.  
   - Fine-tuning models on domain-specific data (e.g., medical records) improves accuracy.  

6. **Skepticism**:  
   - Some argue LLMs are **overhyped** for OCR, advocating for traditional methods in “controlled” scenarios (e.g., Samsung/Google’s OCR tools).  
   - Confidence scores are seen as a form of **“self-awareness”** but don’t fix inherent unreliability in low-quality inputs.  

### Final Takeaway:  
While VLMs/LLMs enhance OCR with context-aware parsing and confidence metrics, **hybrid systems** (OCR + layout models + human review) remain essential for high-stakes applications. The debate underscores the need for better error detection, structured outputs, and cost-effective scalability.

In a thrilling breakthrough for tech enthusiasts and developers, a new league of large language models (LLMs) has hit the scene. Introducing Mercury, the world's first commercial-scale diffusion large language model (dLLM). This latest technology strides ahead with a promise of being up to 10 times faster and considerably cheaper than the existing LLMs we’ve grown accustomed to. At the core of Mercury is a transformation in how models generate text, swapping the traditional autoregressive approach for a cutting-edge diffusion method, offering new realms of possibility in terms of speed and efficiency.

Unlike conventional models that produce text sequentially, one token at a time, Mercury’s diffusion models employ a "coarse-to-fine" generation technique. This allows them to generate text by initially producing a rough draft, which they subsequently refine, making adjustments along the way. This not only enhances the quality by allowing for complex reasoning and error correction but also drastically reduces latency during text generation.

One of the crown jewels of this technology is Mercury Coder, a diffusion model finely-tuned for code generation. Mercury Coder sets a new standard, outperforming current speed-optimized models like GPT-4o Mini and Claude 3.5 Haiku on many coding benchmarks while being up to ten times faster. On the Nvidia H100s, Mercury models can churn out over 1000 tokens per second—a feat previously only achievable with custom chips.

The Mercury Coder symbolizes a leap forward in AI capabilities, offering high-quality, rapid responses at reduced costs. This means that computationally expensive tasks are now more accessible, and it sets a fresh benchmark for enterprises looking to leverage LLMs without breaking the bank. 

Mercury’s emergence marks a significant paradigm shift, with the use of diffusion models in the text and code space finally reaching fruition after successes in fields like image and audio generation. For developers eager to test drive, Mercury Coder is available to try in a playground, and further opportunities exist for enterprises seeking API and on-premise deployments.

### Iterated Log Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://adamscherlis.github.io/blog/iterlog-coding/) | 107 points | by [snarkconjecture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snarkconjecture) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43181610)

Adam Scherlis has unveiled a novel format for encoding real numbers, dubbed "iterated log encoding." This new approach offers a unique method for representing floating-point values on computers and claims to offer advantages in flexibility and precision over traditional fixed-point and floating-point systems.

In traditional fixed-point systems, numbers are stored with a single sign bit plus an absolute value; floating-point numbers work similarly to scientific notation using an exponent and significand. Logarithmic systems enhance upon this by reconstructing numbers as two entities: the logarithmic value and a separate sign bit. Symmetric level-index representations even facilitate encoding extremely large numbers through multiple logarithmic iterations.

The iterated log format revolutionizes these ideas by considering a number iteratively through its logarithms. The method interprets a number in stages: First determining general positivity or negativity, then evaluating the magnitude's logarithmic sign, and further assessing its subsequent logarithmic signs to refine precision. Each sign narrows the interval of possible values, allowing ultra-fine precision as more signs are added.

One quirk of this system is that it inadvertently mirrors Gray code, a sequence order where two successive numbers differ in only one bit, though it may not be the most practical for everyday coding. Through rigorous sign conversion and bit padding, the format achieves lexicographic ordering, handling zero and non-a-number (NaN) values in insightful ways.

With this format, a 7-bit depth becomes astonishingly powerful, able to represent an expansive range of numbers—large, small, or close to one—and showcasing unpredictable precision. This opens potential avenues in computer systems needing unusual numeric precision and range, offering symmetry across zero and an exciting non-uniform distribution of values. For enthusiasts and experts eager to delve into this, a prototype implementation is available with additional mathematical insights promised in upcoming posts.

The Hacker News discussion on Adam Scherlis' **iterated log encoding** method highlights technical debates, comparisons, and critiques. Here's a concise summary of key points:

### Key Themes:

   - Users noted similarities to **Elias delta/omega coding** (for integer compression) and **Levenshtein coding** (variable-length integer encoding), sparking discussions on how iterated log encoding fits within existing frameworks.

2. **Practicality and Arithmetic Challenges**  
   - Concerns about computational efficiency arose:  
     - Arithmetic operations (e.g., addition/subtraction) are non-trivial in this format.  
     - Memory usage could grow rapidly (e.g., 16-bit numbers leading to 4GB storage needs).  
     - **Integer representation is inexact** (e.g., "3" decodes to ≈2.999999983422908 in 32-bit encoding).  
   - Multiplication was deemed simpler, but handling zero, infinity, and exact integers remains a challenge.

3. **Mathematical Connections**  
   - Links to **Dirac’s square-root-based number representation** were debated. Some users argued iterated log encoding resembles recursive exponentiation via square roots.  
   - The method’s log-depth precision was contrasted with Dirac’s approach, which requires exponential symbols for similar precision.

4. **Precision and Practical Use Cases**  
   - Non-uniform precision distribution (clustering near 0.5, 1.0) was noted as both a feature and limitation.  
   - Extreme range (e.g., 8 bits encoding numbers up to 2^2^65536) was praised theoretically but questioned for real-world applications.  
   - Suggested uses: **machine learning intermediate representations**, **compression algorithms** (e.g., DCT coefficients in JPEG-like codecs).

5. **Mixed Reactions**  
   - Praise for novelty and symmetry across positive/negative values.  
   - Skepticism about practicality: Existing systems (e.g., IEEE 754 floats) suffice for most needs, and the format’s complexity may limit adoption.  

### Notable Quotes:
- **On efficiency**: *"Addition/subtraction in log space isn’t straightforward."*  
- **On integers**: *"Exact integers don’t play nicely with this encoding."*  
- **On utility**: *"Does 2^2^65536 matter if Python can’t even compute it without choking?"*  

### Conclusion:  
The iterated log encoding is seen as a fascinating theoretical advance with niche potential (e.g., ML, compression), but practical challenges and competition from established systems like IEEE 754 temper enthusiasm. Its connections to mathematical concepts like Dirac’s methods add intellectual intrigue, yet real-world adoption hinges on solving arithmetic inefficiencies and precision quirks.
