The Unix utility sed is Turing complete, and this fact often surprises many people. Sed, typically used for text filtering, is actually a tiny assembly language with essential operations such as comparison, branching, and a temporary buffer, which collectively make it Turing complete. Christophe Blaess demonstrated this by constructing a Turing machine in sed, providing a downloadable implementation. This proof establishes that sed can implement a Turing machine and hence is Turing complete. 

Sed's capabilities go beyond text manipulation, as users have developed programs like Tetris, Sokoban, and even a calculator using sed. The possibilities with sed as a programming language are impressive and challenging, expanding the horizons of what can be achieved with seemingly simple tools. Sed's Turing completeness also aligns with the concept of the "busy beaver," a theoretical exploration of maximizing output on a Turing machine, adding another layer of complexity to sed's capabilities. 

If you find this intriguing, delve into further Unix utility and computation topics for more captivating insights. And if you are keen on mastering sed, the book "Sed One-Liners Explained" offers practical examples to help you harness the power of sed for various tasks. Stay tuned for more fascinating articles on Unix utilities and computation and continue exploring the depths of these powerful tools.

The autonomous Dallara Super Formula racers faced difficulties during the qualifying time trials, with some cars struggling to complete a full lap, spinning out, colliding with walls, or even taking impromptu breaks on the track.

Despite these initial hurdles, the race eventually commenced, with the lead racer, Polimove, spinning out on the fourth lap, allowing Tum to take the lead and eventually win the race. The AI drivers demonstrated good sportsmanship by obeying the rules, such as not passing each other during caution laps.

While the current state of autonomous racing may be akin to congratulating a baby for feeding itself, it is clear that progress is being made in the field. As technology continues to advance, we can look forward to seeing self-driving racers evolve and improve their performance in the future.

1. **lmbdn** pointed out that the organizers of the race intended to showcase minimal problems with the self-driving cars, suggesting that clearly marked track boundaries are a difference-maker for full-size racing cars. They also brought up the complexity of high-speed vehicle physics in relation to the participation of Arduino in the event. Additionally, **lmbdn** showed interest in knowing more about the physical testing carried out before the race.

2. **bllfrt** mentioned that the teams did not time their software well, leading to cars frequently spinning out during the qualification session. They observed sudden maneuvers that left cars stranded.

3. **krmkz** found the event fun, drawing a parallel with the Super Formula race at Abu Dhabi. They highlighted the lack of details regarding rules implementation and exercises related to ensuring the safety of self-driving cars.

4. **hckplcn** criticized small-scale testing efforts, implying that more resources should have been allocated to test systems in a real-life event.

5. **AwaAwa** discussed racing robot jockeys potentially replacing human jockeys, mentioning the interest in speed and the use of blank canvas deserts to assist in this transition.

6. **mrkss** mentioned that teams started working on the project in September 2023, pointing to a website for more information. They expressed confidence in the performance of the platform powered by DFNT.

7. **rmc** humorously commented on whether people would watch robot racing on Netflix, suggesting a potential lack of interest due to personal preferences.

8. **bllfrt** shared that cars on the track seemed unable to drive smoothly, facing challenges in driving safely and maintaining control due to software issues and changing weather conditions affecting traction.

9. **DrSiemer** expressed a preference for human pilots, citing the importance of the human element in racing. They also mentioned the anticipation of proper remote control for fun racing events where cars smash into various obstacles.

10. **grcy** mentioned that they believed fully autonomous driving systems could potentially outperform human drivers, highlighting the capabilities of the systems in completing laps faster than humans.

### BBC presenter's likeness used in advert after firm tricked by AI-generated voice

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2024/apr/28/bbc-presenters-likeness-used-in-advert-after-firm-tricked-by-ai-generated-voice) | 19 points | by [chrisjj](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chrisjj) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40187456)

In a bizarre turn of events, BBC presenter Liz Bonnin found her likeness being used in an advertisement for insect repellent spray, all thanks to an AI-generated fake voice message. The incident left Bonnin feeling violated as her face appeared on online ads promoting a product she never endorsed.

The whole mix-up began when a company, Incognito, fell for the AI trickery and believed they were in contact with Bonnin, leading to a contract being signed and money exchanged for the ad campaign. It was only after the ads went live that Bonnin clarified she had not agreed to any endorsement deal.

Experts who assessed the fake voice note confirmed it was likely generated by AI due to inconsistencies in the accent and speech quality. Bonnin emphasized the need for caution when approached for deals outside the professional route, as this incident serves as a stark reminder of the potential pitfalls of AI technology being misused.

Incognito has reported the incident to the authorities and issued a public apology to Bonnin for the unintended harm caused. This tale serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of sophisticated AI deceptions and the importance of staying vigilant in the face of such technological advancements.

The discussion revolves around the validation of signatures when contacting a source. Users debate the importance of validating signatures to determine which signatures to trust, with one user emphasizing that knowing which signatures are trustworthy can definitively solve the problem of human error. The conversation touches on referencing associated signatures from people's Twitter profiles, the issue of trusting single party information in a well-known domain, and the context of man-in-the-middle attacks. There is also mention of digitally storing communication content, validating the source's message, and verifying signatures using Public-Key-Infrastructure and pre-installed trusted root certificates. The thread ends with one user introducing a new link and another referring to having bad news.
