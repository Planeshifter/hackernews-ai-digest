Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox web browser, is working on building its own open-source chatbot. The goal is to create a chatbot that is transparent, respects user privacy, and promotes fairness. The team at Mozilla recently undertook a hackathon to build a prototype of the chatbot, which runs entirely on Mozilla's cloud infrastructure and uses free, open-source language models and tooling. They also aimed to integrate Mozilla-specific knowledge into the chatbot so it can answer employee questions about internal matters. The team faced several challenges in building the chatbot, including deciding where to host it and choosing a runtime environment. Despite the complexities, the team sees open-source AI technology as a way to ensure that AI systems are trustworthy and not controlled solely by tech giants.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the effectiveness and limitations of chatbots in customer support, the importance of clear documentation, and the role of AI in replacing or supporting human interaction. 

One commenter mentions that based on their experience in customer support, 40% of customers prefer finding answers themselves instead of contacting support. They suggest that bots can be helpful in quickly answering common questions and reducing customer support costs. However, another commenter argues that while chatbots can be useful, they should not completely replace human support as they may not be able to answer specific or complex questions.

There is also a discussion about the value of documentation. Some commenters express frustration with poorly written or difficult-to-find documentation, suggesting that better documentation could reduce the need for customer support. Others argue that people don't always read documentation or find it helpful, and that improvements in documentation and chatbot capabilities are needed.

The role of AI in customer support is also discussed. Some commenters highlight the limitations of chatbots, stating that they may not be able to understand context or provide tailored answers. Others mention that generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, can be helpful in providing working solutions based on documentation. However, there is also recognition that AI is not a perfect solution and that human support is still necessary in certain cases.

Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of finding the right balance between chatbots and human support, improving documentation, and leveraging AI tools to enhance customer support experiences.

### Automatic music playlist generation via simulation-based reinforcement learning

#### [Submission URL](https://research.atspotify.com/2023/07/automatic-music-playlist-generation-via-simulation-based-reinforcement-learning/) | 54 points | by [saeedesmaili](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saeedesmaili) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36921032)

Researchers at an undisclosed music streaming platform have developed a method to use reinforcement learning (RL) to automatically generate music playlists. The team developed a RL framework for set sequencing to optimize playlists based on user satisfaction. They trained a modified deep Q-Network (DQN), called the Action-Head DQN (AH-DQN), using a simulated playlist-generation environment. The agents trained on public and proprietary streaming datasets outperformed baseline methods in online A/B tests, leading to better user-satisfaction metrics. The researchers also showed that performance assessments from their simulator strongly correlated with observed online metric results. This RL approach is aimed at creating personalized music experiences for users by considering their preferences and the sequential nature of music listening.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of music recommendation algorithms used by music streaming platforms like Spotify. Some users express dissatisfaction with the recommendations provided by Spotify, citing instances where irrelevant or repetitive songs are recommended. Others discuss the financial aspects of music streaming platforms and how the payment structure affects the algorithms used for recommending songs. There is also a discussion on the granularity and effectiveness of Spotify's recommendation system, with some users suggesting that creating personalized playlists can lead to better song recommendations. Additionally, there are conversations about the training of machine learning models and the trade-offs between supervised and reinforcement learning approaches. One user even mentions their experience with creating a personalized "Personal DJ" playlist using AI technology.

### Oops Google Did It Again

#### [Submission URL](https://dombytes.com/post/oops-google-did-it-again/) | 69 points | by [bezout](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bezout) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36921634)

In a recent Hacker News submission titled "The Web Environment Integrity Proposal: A Good Idea or Recipe for Anti-Competitive Practices?" the author discusses Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal. The proposal suggests creating a Web API that allows websites to assess the trustworthiness of a client device before delivering content. While this concept has been implemented by Apple with their Private Access Tokens (PATs), the concern lies in Google's market dominance through Chrome (popular web browser) and Android (leading mobile operating system). If Google were to control the attesters, it could create an anti-competitive environment, making it difficult for new OSes, device vendors, and web browsers to gain access to this functionality. The best case scenario is that Google handles this power responsibly, leading to a more secure and efficient web experience without CAPTCHAs and fake engagement. However, the worst case scenario could result in a walled garden where Google controls which devices are deemed trustworthy, stifling innovation and reinforcing planned obsolescence. The submission suggests that while we allowed Google to attain its current monopoly, it is crucial to consider whether a CAPTCHA-free, bot-less web is worth the potential consequences.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the potential consequences and concerns of Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal.

- One user points out that the sentence "doesn't consider the worst-case scenario," stating that Silicon Valley has become accustomed to summarizing wrong tech trends over the past 15+ years.
- Another user brings up the disadvantages of DRM, mentioning that if John Deere's tractor maintenance can be considered a distressing example, it highlights the negative aspects of DRM.
- One commenter expresses concern about the potential for attestation in today's web becoming the foundation for tomorrow's web, with the majority supporting this concept. They note that the WEI proposal acknowledges the risk of centralizing testing, and suggests that browsers could handle testing themselves, allowing market share to determine testing standards instead.
- Another user wonders if web crawlers aren't controlled by Google, as they might be unable to access valid tokens.
- Someone argues that computer scientists' worst-case scenario allows for the risk of false complaints about WEI and Private Access Tokens (PATs), but Google's dominant position with Chrome and Android could lead to non-competitive practices. They also mention that WEI and PATs are not necessarily directly harmful, but they question their non-competitive purposes.
- In response, another user highlights that attestation can be incentivizing for particular website owners and non-incentivizing for those that offer a decent user experience without being attested. They claim that Apple's PATs cannot make the web standard, but Google successfully pushed it by making it the default. They also mention that PATs are compatible on the web, while WEI is not.
- Another user adds that the transformation is happening, as the majority of services and systems capable of attestation are sleeping in a slippery slope world where content and commercial activity are largely pulled towards the most popular browser again. They also note that other browser makers are gradually adhering to this trend.
- One user mentions a related post that discusses the combined impact of WEI and Safari on market share, indicating that Safari has a significant market share.
- A reply to that comment further breaks down submarket share, pointing out that iOS is a safer system by forgetting it.

Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the potential anti-competitive practices associated with Google's WEI proposal, as well as the implications of centralized testing and attestation control. Some users express skepticism about the motivations behind WEI and the potential consequences for the web ecosystem.
