At Jane Street, OCaml is a popular language used for various tasks including web development and FPGA designs. In this talk, Laurent Mazare discusses using OCaml for machine learning and how to leverage TensorFlow and PyTorch directly from OCaml to build deep learning models and train them on GPUs. Specifically, Mazare focuses on the Reinforcement Learning setting where an agent is trained to play Atari video games using the Deep Q-Learning approach. Before diving into reinforcement learning, he first covers the classical setting of supervised learning and illustrates how OCaml can be used to build a classifier function that goes from images to labeled categories with high accuracy.

Some users shared their experience with OCaml, while others discussed the challenges of implementing classical algorithms related to activity tracking. One user shared a podcast series by Laurent Mazare, a researcher at Jane Street, where he discusses OCaml and machine learning. Another user talked about using OCaml to implement Atari games and the challenges they faced. Finally, one user posted about a rejected cookie policy and navigated away from the page.

### FANN: Vector Search in 200 Lines of Rust

#### [Submission URL](https://fennel.ai/blog/vector-search-in-200-lines-of-rust/) | 154 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36338365)

Vector search is everywhere these days, and it enables complex AI and ML applications. In this post, the authors describe how vector databases work and build a simple vector search library in under 200 lines of Rust code, using a family of algorithms called "Locality Sensitive Hashing." They explain how vector search works using real code snippets and build a simplified vector search index. The approach used is recursive and random, and every internal node is a hyperplane definition. The set of vectors is continuously recursively split until leaf nodes contain no more than a configurable number of vectors.

In the comments, users discuss various approaches to vector search, including the trade-offs between methods such as kd-tree, binary space partitioning, and random projection. There is discussion regarding the efficiency of the presented implementation and how it compares with other methods, as well as considerations for production-level vector databases in terms of scaling, memory, and performance. There is also discussion around approaches to reduce the dimensionality of vectors to improve search efficiency and how these can be combined with LSH.

### TropeTwist: Trope-Based Narrative Structure Generation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09672) | 61 points | by [paddw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=paddw) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36340504)

A new paper titled "TropeTwist: Trope-based Narrative Structure Generation" by Alberto Alvarez and Jose Font proposes a trope-based system for generating abstract and generic game narratives. The system, called TropeTwist, uses interconnected tropes to create narrative graphs which serve as targets for generating novel, quality-diverse narrative structures encoded as graph grammars. The authors present three hand-made narrative structures and use MAP-Elites to generate and evaluate narrative graphs for these structures. The system is evaluated based on coherence and interestingness, which are improved through evolution. The proposed system has potential applications in game design and interactive storytelling.

The discussion in the comments section revolves around the use of tropes in modern scripts. Some users suggest that all modern scripts are based on established tropes. Other users suggest applications of the proposed system, including its potential use in interactive storytelling and game design. Some users explain that the system uses interconnected tropes to create narrative graphs that serve as targets for generating novel narrative structures. There are references to examples of tropes in popular culture, including movies like Stargate and Indiana Jones. Users also discuss the challenge of using tropes in game design and how the proposed system addresses this challenge. Additionally, some users suggest that the paper's proposed narrative structure is similar to that used in games like The Legend of Zelda. Other users discuss the use of tropes in community-driven television shows like Rick and Morty and Community, highlighting the importance of using tropes in character development.

### Amazon confirms it locked Microsoft engineer out his Echo gear over false claim

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/15/amazon_echo_disabled_allegation/) | 49 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36348842)

A Microsoft engineer had his Amazon account suspended and his Echo smart home hardware rendered inoperable after a driver made a false report of racist abuse. Brandon Jackson, a site reliability engineer, said the driver who delivered a package to his home on 24 May claimed to have received "racist remarks" from a Ring doorbell, which was in fact a Eufy. Jackson found he had been disconnected from his Echo Show and other devices the following day, and remained locked out for a week. He found that the driver had misinterpreted an automated doorbell message, and said the incident left him with an "inconvenience".

Commenters expressed concern about the accuracy of the driver's report and the potential for abuse of the system, while others debated the role of technology in listening to and recording conversations in the home. Some users also criticized Amazon's handling of the situation and its policies for suspending accounts. One user suggested that the incident was a reflection of broader issues with technology and its impact on society, while others debated the merits of electric vehicles and climate change policies.
