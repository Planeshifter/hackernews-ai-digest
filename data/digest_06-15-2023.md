#### [Submission URL](https://fennel.ai/blog/vector-search-in-200-lines-of-rust/) | 154 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36338365)

Vector search is everywhere these days, and it enables complex AI and ML applications. In this post, the authors describe how vector databases work and build a simple vector search library in under 200 lines of Rust code, using a family of algorithms called "Locality Sensitive Hashing." They explain how vector search works using real code snippets and build a simplified vector search index. The approach used is recursive and random, and every internal node is a hyperplane definition. The set of vectors is continuously recursively split until leaf nodes contain no more than a configurable number of vectors.

The submission discusses a Rust code implementation for building vector search capabilities using a family of algorithms called "Locality Sensitive Hashing,” which use recursive random approaches where internal nodes are hyperplane definitions.
