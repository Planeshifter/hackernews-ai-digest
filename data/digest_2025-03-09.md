Attention developers and enthusiasts alike! Exciting news from the world of Gleam—the language that turbocharges the Erlang VM and JavaScript runtimes—a fresh version, Gleam v1.9.0, just dropped with some tasty new features to sink your teeth into.

First up, we have Echo Debug Printing. If you’ve ever found yourself knee-deep in print debugging and yearning for a savvier way to track down issues, the new `echo` keyword is here to streamline your life. Simply prefix an expression with `echo`, and voilà—it gets printed along with its file path and line number. Goodbye headaches from aimlessly hunting down errant `io.debug` calls! Plus, the build tool now nudges you to erase debug prints before you ship a package—no more surprises in production deployments.

Next, in a win for flexibility, say hello to Git Dependencies. Now, you can include libraries from Git repositories directly by using URLs and references. This means testing your bleeding-edge or prototype code becomes a breeze, eliminating the cringe of seeing half-baked packages floating around the package manager.

For those wrangling with binary data, Gleam has another treat—more robust JavaScript bit arrays. You can now go beyond the byte-aligned confines, letting you handle dynamically sized bits with elegance and ease, thanks to the hard work of developers like Richard Viney and Surya Rose.

JavaScript users also get a performance boost with smarter list pattern matching, potentially doubling the speed of list-heavy applications, while the new go-to type definition feature elevates your coding environment by showing you the types involved in expressions at the touch of a button.

We also see significant enhancements in documentation and search, with HexDocs now boasting integrated search functionality to track down types and functions across packages. Alternatively, Gleam’s community-developed Gloogle continues to offer powerful search options, including function type signatures.

Enterprises, your day has arrived too with the ability to use custom CA certificates via `GLEAM_CACERTS_PATH`, smoothing out issues with TLS interception and ensuring a hitch-free experience in more controlled environments.
