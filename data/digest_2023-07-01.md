#### [Submission URL](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/databases/announcing-vector-support-in-postgresql-services-to-power-ai-enabled-applications) | 70 points | by [srameshc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=srameshc) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36551936)

Google Cloud Databases has announced the addition of vector support in PostgreSQL services. This new feature allows developers to store and efficiently query vectors in Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL and AlloyDB for PostgreSQL, enabling the use of generative AI in applications. With vector support, developers can store and index vector embeddings generated by large language models (LLMs) and perform similarity searches. This can be useful in various applications, such as providing product recommendations based on user preferences or simulating long-term memory in chatbot conversations. The integration of vector support in PostgreSQL services provides an easy and familiar way for developers to leverage AI capabilities in their applications. Additionally, the Cloud SQL and AlloyDB databases offer enterprise-grade features and tight integration with operational data, making it easier to create AI-enabled experiences that utilize real-time transactional data. The vector support can be combined with Vertex AI services, such as pre-trained models and custom model integration, to further enhance AI capabilities in applications.

### Workers with less experience gain the most from generative AI

In a new study, researchers from MIT and Stanford University have found that generative artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly benefit workers with limited experience. The study focused on contact center agents who had access to a conversational AI assistant. The researchers discovered that these agents saw a 14% boost in productivity, with the largest gains observed among new or low-skilled workers. The generative AI technology helped to upskill the workers rather than replace them. This finding highlights the potential for generative AI to decrease inequality in productivity, providing opportunities for less-experienced workers to improve at their jobs more quickly. The study also revealed that the use of generative AI led to efficiency gains, with workers experiencing an increase in the number of customer chats resolved per hour, improved customer sentiment, and fewer requests to speak to a manager. Overall, the research suggests that generative AI can have a positive impact on the workforce, particularly for those with limited experience.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the claim that generative AI can significantly benefit workers with limited experience. Some users express skepticism about the specific claims of a 10x or 100x improvement in productivity, suggesting that a 5-10% improvement seems more reasonable. Others point out that while generative AI can be helpful for tasks like searching for information or writing small scripts, it may not be as effective for more complex programming tasks that require a deeper understanding of systems and coding. Some users share their experiences with generative AI models like GPT-4, noting that they have been helpful in generating SQL queries and providing detailed explanations. Overall, the discussion focuses on the potential limitations and benefits of generative AI in the workforce.

### AMD's AI chips could match Nvidia's offerings, software firm says

AI chips from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are showing promise as a strong challenger to Nvidia's dominant position in the market, according to a report by AI software firm MosaicML. The report states that AMD's chips are currently about 80% as fast as Nvidia's, with a future path to matching their performance. This comes at a time when tech companies are looking for alternatives to Nvidia due to a shortage of its chips. MosaicML conducted a test comparing AMD's MI250 chip to Nvidia's A100, and found that AMD's chip was able to achieve 80% of the performance of Nvidia's, thanks to recent software updates and improvements. MosaicML believes that further software updates from AMD will help its chip match the performance of Nvidia's flagship chip. This report highlights the growing competition in the AI chip market and the potential for AMD to gain market share.

The discussion revolves around different aspects of AMD's AI chips and their competition with Nvidia. Some users express skepticism about AMD's software support, noting issues with previous GPU software and drivers. There are also mentions of AMD's slow community support and concerns about the company's ability to address software problems. One user believes that AMD's success with its Zen architecture has made people forget about the company's previous troubles. Another user mentions that developers are experimenting with rented virtual machines and are not using AMD's Radeon cards. Support for AMD's RDNA2 graphics cards and the performance metric in graphics competition are also discussed. There is mention of Nvidia's decision to implement CUDA support and a comparison to AMD's GPU software. The challenges for AMD are seen as brand name recognition and software support. One user emphasizes that performance is a significant metric, while another highlights the importance of driver support and software for desktop and casual gamers.
