#### [Submission URL](https://p.migdal.pl/blog/2025/01/dont-use-cosine-similarity/) | 388 points | by [stared](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stared) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42704078)

In Piotr Migdał's insightful article, "Don't use cosine similarity carelessly," he delves into the pitfalls of applying cosine similarity too readily when working with vector embeddings in AI. Drawing a parallel to King Midas, Migdał cautions that just because we can transform data into vectors—a practice integral to AI—doesn't mean we should do so blindly. 

The piece explores how cosine similarity, while a helpful tool for measuring vector alignment, can lead to misleading results. For example, when comparing sentences with similar structures but different meanings, cosine similarity may inaccurately reflect their semantic relationship. Migdał provides an example where the sentences "Python can make you rich" and "Mastering Python can fill your pockets" share thematic connections not captured by raw similarity metrics, which often prioritize superficial similarities like spelling over context.

Woven throughout the article is a strong reminder of the need for intentionality in how we measure similarity in high-dimensional spaces. Migdał urges data scientists to explore beyond cosine similarity, suggesting alternatives such as Pearson correlation, especially when dealing with models where cosine similarity isn't the training objective. He emphasizes that while cosine similarity is a quick and easy fix, relying on it exclusively can obscure deeper issues and lead to erroneous interpretations.

In essence, Migdał encourages readers to approach vector comparisons with caution, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of how similarity metrics operate to ensure better outcomes in data analysis and machine learning.
