### The Wrong Way to Use a Signed Distance Function (SDF)

#### [Submission URL](https://winterbloed.be/the-wrong-way-to-use-a-signed-distance-function/) | 41 points | by [AnthonBerg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=AnthonBerg) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517365)

In a delightful exploration of creative coding, a recent dive into signed distance functions (SDFs) sparked a conversation about the playful misuse of mathematical tools to create striking visual art. Inspired by Mike Brondbjerg's Twitter share showcasing particles floating through a field, a novel approach to using SDFs emerged. Typically associated with raytracing and shaders for defining smooth, meshless geometry, SDFs are getting a new life. By leveraging these functions, you can generate rich point clouds that, when processed a step further, yield visually stunning renders.

Imagine particles colliding with spheres in an abstract dance—this is brought to life by calculating distances from particles to sphere centers, determining interactions based on their spatial relationship. By creatively manipulating these functions, the space is divided into regions: inside, on, or outside the sphere. It gets even more intriguing when noise is added to the equation, an unorthodox move that challenges mathematical rigor but opens up boundless creative possibilities.

This exploration of geometric collisions and transformations doesn’t stop at spheres. By swapping the SDF with functions for other shapes like boxes or toruses, the creative playground expands. The joy of this method lies in its versatility—one can combine different signed distance functions for complex results without getting tangled in mathematical rigor.

Though the concepts are often presented in the realm of OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), integrating them into Processing and other platforms is very possible. This fusion of math and art might not strictly adhere to traditional SDF requirements, but it exemplifies the spirit of creative coding—embracing chaos while crafting beauty.

The discussion revolves around a disagreement about the relevance and implications of referencing Twitter in an article about creative coding with signed distance functions (SDFs). Here's a concise summary of the exchange:

1. **Downvote Justification**: A user (*Dylan16807*) downvoted the submission, arguing that the article’s reference to a 2020 tweet and its perceived anti-Twitter stance lacked rigor. They criticized the article for indirectly dismissing Twitter’s role in broader societal contexts (e.g., democracy) and questioned the relevance of using outdated social media posts.

2. **Counterargument**: Another user (*tlkngtb*) acknowledged valid points but countered that the criticism was overly reductive. They suggested that judging the article’s stance on Twitter (and equating it to a rejection of pro-democracy values) imposed a rigid, binary interpretation. The focus, they argued, should be on the technical creativity of the SDF exploration, not politicizing the platform used for inspiration.

3. **Nuance vs. Binary Thinking**: *Dylan16807* reiterated their stance, emphasizing that referencing Twitter—especially older posts—could carry unintended political weight. They accused critics of oversimplifying the debate, asserting that supporting Twitter’s societal role doesn’t negate valid critiques of its use in technical articles.

**Key Takeaway**: The debate highlights tensions between technical content and the perceived socio-political implications of citing platforms like Twitter. While one side saw the reference as a problematic overreach, the other viewed the critique as an unnecessary distraction from the article’s creative focus.
