### Consistency LLM: converting LLMs to parallel decoders accelerates inference 3.5x

#### [Submission URL](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/cllm/) | 411 points | by [zhisbug](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zhisbug) | [81 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40302201)

The blog post delves into the concept of Consistency Large Language Models (CLLMs), a novel approach to parallel decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditionally, LLMs decode sequences token by token, leading to high latency for longer responses. However, CLLMs are trained to operate as efficient parallel decoders, aiming to reduce inference latency. The post introduces the idea of Jacobi decoding, a method that transforms the sequential generation process into a parallel computation. By iteratively updating an initially guessed $n$-token sequence until convergence, Jacobi decoding mimics the human cognitive process of forming complete sentences in mind before articulating word by word. While vanilla Jacobi decoding shows limited speedup over autoregressive (AR) decoding, CLLMs seek to improve efficiency without incurring additional memory costs at inference time.

Furthermore, the post discusses training CLLMs by mapping any point on the Jacobi trajectory to the fixed point efficiently. This training method aims to reduce the inference latency by encouraging convergence to the final AR generation outcome in a single step. The results show significant improvements in generation speed, making CLLMs competitive with other fast inference techniques like Medusa2 and Eagle.
Overall, the post highlights the potential of CLLMs in enhancing the efficiency of LLMs by transitioning from sequential decoders to efficient parallel decoders, ultimately reducing latency and improving performance in text generation tasks.
