#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Danau5tin/terminal-bench-rl) | 123 points | by [Danau5tin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Danau5tin) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44721791)

In today’s top story from Hacker News, we dive into an impressive project involving reinforcement learning (RL) and terminal-based agents. A developer named Danau5tin has created an RL training framework, successfully scaling it to utilize 32x H100 GPUs across four nodes for long-horizon terminal and coding tasks. This ambitious project extends upon UC Berkeley's rLLM framework, specifically tailoring it for training sophisticated terminal-based agents.

The highlight of this endeavor, known as Terminal-Agent-Qwen3-32b, has outperformed major competitors like Stanford's Terminus-Qwen3-235B-30A and even OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with Codex agent, claiming the top spot for Qwen3 agents on the prestigious TerminalBench leaderboard. However, due to the substantial compute costs—estimated between £30k-£50k—the project couldn't reach its full training potential on available resources.

Danau5tin ingeniously designed custom environments and tools, providing agents with capabilities akin to planning, file operations, search functions, and bash execution—all essential for tackling complex terminal tasks. The project integrates a dynamic judge evaluation system and employs both reward design and a structured action-based architecture to ensure agent effectiveness.

Despite not being able to complete a full training cycle due to computational constraints, Danau5tin’s work sets a foundation for anyone with access to substantial GPU resources to further train and explore the potential of RL in terminal tasks. This project not only showcases the power of reinforcement learning in niche applications but also marks a significant milestone in terminal-based RL agent development.

### Supervised fine tuning on curated data is reinforcement learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856) | 66 points | by [GabrielBianconi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GabrielBianconi) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44727788)

Machine learning enthusiasts, take note: a new research paper spotted on arXiv, titled "Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)" by Chongli Qin and Jost Tobias Springenberg, offers intriguing insights into the realms of behavior cloning and supervised fine-tuning. The authors argue that the common practice of using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated data can actually be seen as a form of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically within a sparse reward context.

What's exciting is the introduction of a novel approach called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which tweaks the traditional SFT method to optimize a tighter RL objective. This simple yet effective modification can enhance performance by aligning more closely with RL training methods.

Illustrating its potential, the iw-SFT variant shows competitive results, matching up against advanced RL algorithms, especially in tasks involving large language models and continuous control tasks. It even managed to achieve an admirable 66.7% performance on the AIME 2024 dataset. For those interested in diving deeper, complete details and the code are available through the project's website.

This development holds promise for anyone working with large language models or imitation learning, as it bridges the gap between classical supervised learning and reinforcement learning, potentially unlocking new avenues for enhancing model performance.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Practical Applications & Cost Savings**:  
   User **nndvsn** highlights experiments showing that fine-tuning smaller models on curated outputs from larger models drastically reduces inference costs (30x lower) and speeds up performance (4x faster). Tests involved navigation, RAG, and multi-hop QA tasks. The approach competes with closed-source (OpenAI, Google) and open-source models (Qwen), suggesting small models can rival large ones at a fraction of the cost.

2. **Code Sharing & Tooling**:  
   The authors (e.g., **chnglqn**, likely Chongli Qin) shared a GitHub link to the iw-SFT code. **GabrielBianconi** mentioned a related GPU-optimization tool (Unsloth) and an ongoing pull request for further integration.

3. **Technical Debates on RL vs. SFT**:  
   - **ndnfrth** and **mtrngd** questioned framing SFT as RL, arguing RL involves sequential decision-making, not just single-step optimization. **mtrngd** critiqued conflating SFT with Q-Learning, noting RL's focus on cumulative rewards.  
   - **chnglqn** countered that their method uses REINFORCE-style policy gradients to bridge SFT and RL, particularly in sparse-reward settings (common in LLMs).

4. **Benchmark Critique**:  
   **stlncd** criticized the paper’s 66.7% score on AIME 2024, comparing it to a "D-" grade and noting it’s a 12th-grade-level benchmark. Others (**sprmdgy**, **jpcmprtr**) countered that modest results are still valuable, with **stlncd** later conceding it might equate to a "B+" relative to students.

5. **Industry Context**:  
   **hnrqgdy** emphasized the potential for smaller, distilled models to address compliance and communication issues in enterprises. **jtsprngnbrg** (Jost Springenberg) clarified the work was an independent effort (not an official DeepMind project), sparking interest in its origins.

**Key Takeaways**:

The community values code accessibility and sees potential in distilling smaller models, though debates around methodology and evaluation persist.

### Playing with Open Source LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://alicegg.tech//2025/07/29/open-source-llm.html) | 73 points | by [zer0tonin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zer0tonin) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44726838)

In a world where AI advancements are rolling in like waves on a beach, our intrepid coder decides to venture out of their comfort zone every six months to explore the latest tools. This time, the buzz was around AI-enhanced command-line tools, specifically tailored for writing code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Entering the spotlight is Claude Code, a tool that promises full autonomy in coding activities, from searching to committing code. However, our reluctant tech enthusiast remains wary of investing in potentially temporary vendor solutions.

To avoid getting trapped in costly or evolving services, they embarked on a journey through the open-source landscape in search of a suitable LLM for coding tasks. They tested various models, including the popular deepseek-r1:8b from China, the French contender mistral:7b, and Alibaba's qwen3:8b. After much trial and error, the qwen3:8b emerged as the favored model due to its balance between accuracy and usability on local setups.

For running these models locally, the coder set up an API using Ollama, a tool likened to Docker but specifically for LLMs, offering an easy way to manage and run these models. With the local API ready, they paired it with 'aider,' a pair programming application designed to work collaboratively with the model. Aider aids in passing context, running linters, and making code changes.

Our explorer then put the setup to the test. In a refactoring task within the Itako project, aider managed to make the instructed changes but ventured outside the task’s scope—a reminder of the tool's current developmental stage. Despite the intrigue, the time investment didn't justify the marginal output improvement for small tasks. For a fresh, greenfield project, however, the coder is keen to see what their new digital assistant can accomplish, leaving endless possibilities and hopefully more productive coding sessions on the horizon.

This adventure reflects the perpetual journey of developers in keeping pace with technological evolution, always weighing the complexities of AI tools against their practical benefits. As the coder retires to their proverbial cave, they do so with fresh insights and a renewed toolkit for future coding endeavors.

While these models can generate functional code, smaller models (e.g., 8B) struggle with complex coding tasks compared to larger ones. However, they remain cost-effective for basic usage or specific applications like text processing.
   - Skepticism persists about whether small models will ever match the performance of larger counterparts, though advances like "mixture of experts" architectures and distillation techniques offer hope.

2. **Open-Source Definitions for AI Models:**
   - Debate erupted over what qualifies an AI model as "open-source." Critics argued that the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has relaxed standards by not requiring training data release, leading to models like Llama being labeled "open" despite opaque training processes.
   - Some users emphasized that true openness requires releasing not just weights and inference code, but also training data, preprocessing scripts, and documentation to enable reproducibility. Others countered that practical constraints (e.g., legal issues with web-scraped data) make full transparency unrealistic.

3. **Local vs. Cloud Trade-offs:**
   - Running models locally saves costs and avoids vendor lock-in but demands significant hardware resources. Users highlighted tools like Ollama for local LLM management, though cost-benefit trade-offs arise when comparing local setups to cloud-based, proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT).

4. **Ethical and Transparency Concerns:**
   - Concerns were raised about "Trojan horse" risks with closed training data, where models might inadvertently include biased or harmful content. Proposals for stricter open-model criteria included licensing guardrails (e.g., O-RAIL) and auditability of training corpora.

5. **Industry Dynamics:**
   - Criticisms targeted tech companies for co-opting "open-source" branding without meeting traditional standards (e.g., Meta’s Llama license restrictions). Calls were made for new frameworks (e.g., "Fair Software") to address gaps between AI models and classic open-source software principles.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a community grappling with the rapid evolution of AI tools, balancing excitement over local, open-source LLMs with frustrations over definitions of openness and skepticism about their current limitations compared to proprietary alternatives.

   - Some argue Claude identifies logical tensions rather than outright contradictions, reflecting the complexity of human thought. Others critique this as "continental philosophy"-style vagueness.  

2. **Philosophical Tensions**:  
   - Eastern philosophies (acceptance, compassion) vs. Western ideals (agency, action) are discussed, referencing Buddhist concepts like *wrathful deities* (e.g., Mahakala) and self-immolation protests (e.g., Thich Quang Đức).  
   - Debates arise over whether symbolic depictions in Buddhism (e.g., compassionate cruelty) are literal contradictions or metaphors for deeper truths about suffering and liberation.  

3. **AI Reliability & Understanding**:  
   - Skepticism emerges about AI’s ability to provide meaningful insights, with users highlighting hallucinations (e.g., ChatGPT inventing links) and laypeople misjudging AI limitations.  
   - Some defend AI's utility as a reflective tool, while others dismiss Claude’s analysis as niche or irrelevant without access to the original Obsidian vault.  

4. **Cultural & Behavioral Critiques**:  
   - Discussions contrast "thoughtful" platforms (e.g., Hacker News) with reactive social media, lamenting the decline of long-form discourse.  
   - The tension between creating versus consuming content online is noted, alongside critiques of AI’s role in amplifying shallow engagement.  

In summary, the thread explores intersections of human philosophy, digital behavior, and AI’s interpretive limits, with recurring doubts about technology’s capacity to navigate nuanced human contradictions.

### Ads are inevitable in AI, and that's okay

#### [Submission URL](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/yes-ads-are-inevitable-in-ai-its) | 5 points | by [FergusArgyll](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FergusArgyll) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44725745)

In a thought-provoking post by Rohit Krishnan, the inevitability and acceptance of ads in AI models are explored as AI technology continues to evolve rapidly. As major players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini lead the way, the AI model landscape is swiftly becoming more commoditized, with companies like Bytedance and Alibaba trying to keep pace. These AI models are increasingly decreasing in cost yet rising in usage, pushing companies to find new ways to offer unique value and secure their footing in a growing market.

Krishnan suggests that despite the models being interchangeable in functionality, companies can differentiate themselves through innovative product variations and orchestration, as seen with OpenAI's Operator and Codex, and Gemini's appealing Storybook feature. The AI ecosystem may soon resemble SaaS companies in their battle for consumer attention through user experience enhancements.

However, merely offering models at a low price won't suffice for companies longing to join the trillion-dollar realm. The post proposes an obvious yet effective solution—advertising, as seen as a cornerstone business model across various industries. Advertising could serve to optimize pricing models by monetizing AI interactions more effectively, potentially turning AI services into low-margin but high-volume enterprises, echoing the scale and approach of retail giants like Amazon and Costco.

Yet, questions remain about what the future holds for AI models and whether companies will manage to carve out distinct niches or if we'll merely see new layers added to existing technologies. The introduction of ads could provide a robust revenue stream for AI companies and possibly reshape the landscape where AI becomes not just a tool for interaction but also a platform for targeted, intelligent advertising.

The discussion reflects polarized reactions to the idea of integrating ads into AI models. One user critiques ads as "extremely bad" and "terrible," warning of degraded user experiences. Another dismisses the issue as "comparatively small" compared to broader corporate practices, framing ads as inevitable but tolerable. A comment referencing ChatGPT hints at excitement about AI's potential but skepticism about commercialization ("revolutionized machine learning... rethinking concepts"), while others use fragmented or cryptic shorthand. Overall, the conversation captures resistance to ads in AI services, contrasting with the submission’s argument for ads as a pragmatic revenue model. Some users fear intrusive monetization, while others pragmatically accept it as a minor trade-off.

### Meta Is Going to Let Job Candidates Use AI During Coding Tests

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/meta-ai-job-interview-coding/) | 48 points | by [geox](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geox) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44723289)

Meta is taking a futuristic approach to coding interviews by allowing job candidates to use AI assistants, pushing the boundaries in Silicon Valley's evolving tech landscape. According to internal communications obtained by 404 Media, Meta is calling on current employees to participate in "mock AI-enabled interviews" to help sculpt this new standard. This bold initiative reflects Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of future workspaces where AI collaborates with engineers, eventually empowering human creativity by taking over routine coding tasks.

Zuckerberg has expressed confidence that in the near future, AI "coding agents" could function as midlevel engineers, crafting the code for various applications. This transformation aims to design a workplace where engineers are more creators and less bogged down by routine tasks.

However, the idea of AI-supported interviews is stirring debate in the tech world. On one side, firms like Meta are embracing this opportunity, seeing AI as a tool to innovate and enhance productivity. In contrast, others, like Anthropic, strictly prohibit AI use in recruitment processes, wary of a generation that's more adept at "vibecoding" than genuine software engineering. Critics fear this shift could lead to engineers who understand AI-prompting better than they do debugging code.

While Meta's spokesperson highlights the company’s commitment to integrating AI as a daily tool for their engineers, other tech entities remain cautious, maintaining traditional interview practices. As the tech industry grapples with this new era, Meta's move could signal a significant shift towards AI-assisted creativity and efficiency, impacting how software engineers are hired and how they work.

Others suggest interviews should reflect actual job requirements, focusing on explaining approaches rather than memorization.

2. **Concerns About Skill Erosion:**  
   Critics worry reliance on AI could degrade fundamental coding and debugging abilities. They fear candidates might excel at prompting AI but struggle with critical tasks like optimizing code or explaining technical decisions. Skeptics liken this to "vibecoding"—prioritizing AI-generated output over deep comprehension.

3. **Debate on Leetcode-Style Tests:**  
   Comments note that traditional coding interviews (e.g., LeetCode) already face criticism for favoring memorization over practical skills. Meta’s shift to AI-assisted interviews is seen by some as an extension of flawed metrics, potentially masking true competency, while others view it as a progressive alignment with workplace realities.

4. **Industry Perspectives:**  
   Comparisons are drawn between companies embracing AI (Meta) and those resisting it (Anthropic). Some argue AI use could streamline hiring objectivity, while others highlight legal or trust challenges. A recurring theme is whether AI assessments can reliably measure problem-solving versus mere tool proficiency.

5. **Meta’s Implementation Concerns:**  
   Participants question if Meta’s approach evaluates prompt engineering more than coding skill, risking hires who lack foundational knowledge. Others speculate it might prioritize speed and product output over code quality, reflecting broader Silicon Valley pressures.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion underscores a tension between innovation and tradition in tech hiring. While AI-assisted interviews could modernize evaluations, they also risk undervaluing core engineering skills, raising questions about how to balance tool usage with authentic competency assessment.
