In a post from the book "Deep Learning with Python," the author discusses the simplicity of deep learning and how it operates in a geometric space. Deep learning models use parametric models trained with gradient descent to transform input data into output data. This transformation is broken down into simple geometric transformations performed by different layers in the model. The key is that the transformation must be differentiable to allow for gradient descent. The author compares this process to uncrumpling a paper ball in 3D. However, there are limitations to what deep learning can accomplish. Tasks that require reasoning, algorithmic-like data manipulation, and long-term planning are out of reach for deep learning models. Additionally, most programs cannot be expressed as continuous geometric transformations, making them difficult to learn. Increasing the number of layers and training data can only partially alleviate these limitations. The author also warns against anthropomorphizing deep learning models, as they do not truly understand the content they are working with.

The discussion on this post revolves around several points. 

One commenter argues that anthropomorphizing AI and treating it as if it has human-like consciousness is incorrect and stems from a narrow perspective on intelligence. They believe that animals possess various forms of intelligence and consciousness that are different from human cognition, and it is incorrect to attribute human-like qualities to AI.

Another commenter disagrees and suggests that AI does not possess significant cognitive abilities or intelligence similar to humans. They argue that animals have different types of intelligence and consciousness, and AI does not possess those qualities.

In response to the discussion on anthropomorphizing AI, another commenter brings up the limitations of deep learning. They discuss that it is not feasible for deep learning models to generate papers, codebases, or complex systems just by reading product descriptions. They argue that the complexity threshold for generating functioning code is quite high, and deep learning models would require multiple rounds of correction and a significant amount of time to achieve any level of success.

Another commenter points out that the original post from the book "Deep Learning with Python" has limitations in terms of its perspective on AI progress. They believe that progress has been slower than predicted, and there are still many challenges to overcome in natural language processing and generalization.

Overall, the discussion touches on the limitations of deep learning, the anthropomorphizing of AI, and the challenges in AI progress.

### GM says it's dropping Apple CarPlay and Android Auto because they're unsafe

#### [Submission URL](https://jalopnik.com/gm-drops-apple-carplay-android-auto-unsafe-phone-1851093013) | 181 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [415 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38622476)

General Motors (GM) is facing criticism for its decision to drop Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in favor of its in-house system, Ultifi. To defend its decision, GM claims that the popular phone mirroring programs actually pose safety risks by encouraging drivers to use their phones while behind the wheel. GM's head of product for infotainment, Tim Babbit, cited stability issues with CarPlay and Android Auto, such as bad connections and slow responses, which lead drivers to pick up their phones and take their eyes off the road. GM believes that if their in-house system is robust enough, drivers will be less likely to rely on their phones for their infotainment needs. The Ultifi system, debuting in the 2024 Chevy Blazer EV, uses Google apps like Maps and Assistant for enhanced voice controls. Additionally, GM is hoping to profit from driver data and subscription services through the Ultifi system. The success of this gamble remains to be seen as more GM vehicles integrate with Ultifi from next year.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the decision by General Motors (GM) to drop Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in favor of its in-house system, Ultifi. Some users sympathize with GM's position, noting that phone mirroring programs like CarPlay and Android Auto can be unreliable and may encourage drivers to use their phones while driving. Others argue that GM's decision is driven by self-interest and a desire to profit from driver data and subscription services. The discussion also touches on the reliability of infotainment systems in general, with users sharing their experiences with different car brands. Some users express concerns about the increasing control that Apple and Google have over the automotive industry, while others believe that vehicle manufacturers should focus on building their own in-house systems. Overall, the discussion highlights the varying opinions on the role of phone mirroring programs and the future of infotainment systems in cars.
