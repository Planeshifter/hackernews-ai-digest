### Grand-Master Level Chess Without Search: Modeling Choices and Their Implications

#### [Submission URL](https://gist.github.com/yoavg/8b98bbd70eb187cf1852b3485b8cda4f) | 93 points | by [georgehill](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=georgehill) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39328684)

Researchers at Google DeepMind have released a paper detailing a learned system that can play blitz-chess at a grandmaster level without using search. This is significant because previous computer-chess systems at this level have relied on search components. The paper has generated a range of reactions, with some impressed by the implications for AI learning abilities and others pointing out that it only applies to blitz-chess. However, upon closer examination, the paper does not claim certain assertions being made about the AI's abilities. The paper is well-written and does not over-claim, but there are some misconceptions regarding the model's achievements. The paper utilized a learning setup with 10 million human-human chess games, training a transformer-based model to predict the winning probability of moves. The model was then used to play games without search, achieving grandmaster-level performance. Overall, the results are impressive, but it is important not to overstate the capabilities of the AI system.

The discussion on the submission revolves around different interpretations of the paper and the capabilities of the AI system. Some commenters point out that the paper does not claim certain assertions being made about the AI's abilities. They explain that while the AI can play blitz-chess at a grandmaster level without using search, it does not mean it can perform the same way in other contexts. 

There is also a debate about the role of search in chess playing. Some argue that grandmasters rely on search and that the AI system in the paper simply flattens the search paths in high-dimensional space. Others contend that strong chess players understand the structure of positions and do not rely heavily on search.

Some comments highlight the limitations of the paper's training method and question the validity of its claims. They argue that the learning method used by the AI is not capable of learning arbitrary rules and that the model simply predicts move probabilities based on the provided training data.

There are also discussions about the importance of prior chess knowledge and the ability of the AI to recognize specific patterns in the game. Some commenters mention Chess960 and traditional chess as different domains where the AI's performance may vary.

There is criticism of DeepMind's research and claims, with some commenters accusing them of exaggerating their results and generating hype. Others argue that these criticisms are common in the research field and that they mostly come from uninformed individuals. Overall, the discussion covers a range of perspectives on the paper and the implications of the AI's abilities.

Artificial intelligence (AI) firm Aware is helping major companies like Walmart, Delta, T-Mobile, Chevron, and Starbucks analyze employee messages for various purposes, according to the company. Aware's AI technology allows companies to understand employee sentiment in real-time, monitor compliance, and identify behaviors such as bullying, harassment, and discrimination. The analytics tool does not flag individual employee names but can do so in extreme cases where there are predetermined risks. While this employee surveillance AI market is rapidly expanding, there are concerns about privacy and treating employees like "inventory." Aware's revenue has grown by 150% on average over the past five years, and its competitors include Qualtrics, Relativity, Proofpoint, Smarsh, and Netskope.

The discussion surrounding the submission revolves around the concerns regarding privacy and the ethical implications of employee surveillance. Some users argue that the expectation of privacy in workplace communications is low and that companies have the right to monitor and analyze internal communications. Others express concerns about the potential abuse of such technology and the erosion of privacy. The discussion also touches on broader topics such as the normalization of surveillance and the role of governments and corporations in data collection. Some users argue that the surveillance and monitoring of internal corporate communications should be subject to legal regulations, while others emphasize the importance of individual accountability and self-regulation. Overall, the discussion highlights the complex ethical and societal implications of using AI technology for employee monitoring.

### Will Artificial Intelligence Lead to War?

#### [Submission URL](https://nationalinterest.org/feature/will-artificial-intelligence-lead-war-208958) | 16 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39329478)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reshape the dynamics of international conflicts and pose risks to global stability. Large language models and generative AI can impact strategic thinking and alter perceptions of capabilities and intentions. The use of AI by adversarial powers like China and North Korea could challenge the effectiveness of deterrence strategies by predicting and discounting actions taken by the United States. The reliance on AI in strategic decision-making may lead to misperceptions, false confidence, and even an increased risk of conflict. China aims to use AI as part of a "smart deterrence" policy, but it could inadvertently act as a catalyst for war. The People's Liberation Army (PLA) of China is integrating predictive AI to outwit opposing militaries and achieve strategic effects. Similarly, North Korea is quietly developing AI and machine learning capabilities for military purposes. The regime prioritizes military power and may apply AI to strategic planning. These developments highlight the need for policymakers to scrutinize and invest in three areas: reinforcing deterrence strategies, enhancing military-to-military dialogue, and investing in AI capabilities for defensive purposes. Overall, the use of AI in military contexts introduces uncertainties and potential destabilization, increasing the risk of conflict.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects related to the use of AI in international conflicts. 

One user points out that China has a history of modernizing its military and may be planning cyber and psychological warfare based on advanced technologies like AI. They express concerns about the potential misinformation and misperceptions that AI can create, as well as the risk of a war as a result.

In response, another user mentions that the American public may have a distorted perception of the military capabilities of China and the effectiveness of American deterrence strategies. They also discuss the overwhelming support for nuclear response among the American population.

Another user brings up the issue of corruption within the Chinese military, comparing it to Russia's corruption problems. They argue that China's military corruption may be a result of stealing technology and resources, and it partially explains their rapid advancement.

The discussion then shifts to the impact of AI on military capabilities. One user suggests that the Malthusian model of population growth applies to China, as it heavily relies on imported resources to sustain its expanding population.

A separate discussion focuses on concerns about TikTok, a Chinese app, and the potential influence it may have on American children. This leads to a debate about the responsibility of parents and the infiltration of Chinese propaganda.

Another user mentions the importance of China's role as a supplier of cheap products to American companies and raises the point that AI, particularly GPTs (large language models), can have productive and potentially entertaining applications in mining cryptocurrencies.

There are also brief comments about leadership and the unwillingness of nations to deescalate tension, the impact of natural stupidity, the influence of AI on wars, and the potential for AI to aid in drug development.

In summary, the discussion covers concerns about China's use of AI in military planning, the potential for misinformation and misperception in international conflicts, the impact of corruption on military advancements, the role of imported resources in sustaining population growth, the influence of Chinese apps on American children, the productivity of AI in cryptocurrency mining, and other miscellaneous topics.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.engadget.com/who-makes-money-when-ai-reads-the-internet-for-us-200246690.html) | 28 points | by [kripy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kripy) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39324689)

"The Browser Company's new iPhone app, Arc Search, has stirred up controversy with its 'Browse for Me' feature that reads web pages and summarizes them into a single, custom-built web page using large language models from OpenAI and others. While the feature has been praised for its convenience, critics argue that it diminishes the need for users to visit actual websites, depriving creators of compensation for their work. The CEO of The Browser Company, Josh Miller, acknowledges the ethical concerns but believes that the way web creators monetize their content needs to evolve. However, the lack of a clear compensation plan for creators has raised further questions. The future of web browsing and AI's role in the dissemination of information remains a topic of debate."

The discussion regarding the submission centers around various perspectives on the "Browse for Me" feature of The Browser Company's new iPhone app, Arc Search. Some users express concerns over the potential negative impact on web creators and their compensation. They argue that the app's summarization feature may discourage users from visiting actual websites and diminish the value of creators' work. The lack of a clear compensation plan for creators raises further questions and ethical concerns.

Other users suggest alternative monetization models, such as allowing microtransactions for viewing individual articles or implementing subscription-based systems. Some propose using cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, while others mention the potential benefits of AI-powered web readers for normal company websites and publishers. 

One user humorously compares Arc Search to a hypothetical scenario of rolling up newspapers to keep people busy while they read the news. Another user points out the prevalence of AI-generated content and the issues it creates, such as clickbait, low-quality articles, and manipulation of search engine rankings. They also mention the need for a transparent filtration system to ensure a clean and reliable online environment.

There is a discussion about the blocking of Arc's crawler, with some users sharing their opinions on the potential consequences. One user believes that blocking Arc may not have a significant impact on its AI-enhanced browsing and search capabilities and compares it to similar technologies from Google. They express concerns about the future of content consumption and suggest exploring options like paywalls and redistributive payment arrangements.

There is also a comment highlighting the cyclical nature of publishers complaining about AI-generated content, suggesting that publishers should focus on producing quality and unique content rather than blaming AI advancements.
