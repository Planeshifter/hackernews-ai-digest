### Jim Keller suggests Nvidia should have used Ethernet to link Blackwell GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-suggests-nvidia-should-have-used-ethernet-to-stitch-together-blackwell-gpus) | 22 points | by [westurner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=westurner) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40026619)

The recent debate sparked by Jim Keller, a respected figure in the tech industry, suggests that Nvidia should have used Ethernet instead of proprietary NVLink for chip-to-chip connectivity in its GPUs, specifically the GB200 model. Keller argues that this move could have saved money for Nvidia and its users while making it easier to migrate software to different hardware platforms.

Nvidia's decision to stick with proprietary technologies like NVLink and InfiniBand raises concerns about vendor lock-in and the potential challenges in porting software to other platforms. While Ethernet is a more universal and competitive option, Nvidia's current approach aligns with its strategic interests in maintaining dominance with CUDA software and proprietary interconnects.

However, the emergence of Ultra Ethernet as a promising technology for AI and HPC communication, alongside the industry-supported Unified Accelerator Foundation (UXL) as an alternative to CUDA, poses challenges to Nvidia's current position. If open-standard technologies surpass Nvidia's proprietary solutions in performance and capabilities, the company may need to rethink its strategies in the future. For now, Nvidia continues to leverage its proprietary technologies while facing evolving industry dynamics.

The comments on Hacker News discuss Jim Keller's viewpoint on Nvidia's choice of using Ethernet versus proprietary NVLink for chip-to-chip connectivity in GPUs. Some users argue in favor of Ethernet, citing Jim Keller's convincing arguments and highlighting the potential benefits of a more universal solution. Others point out the technical differences between the two technologies, such as Infiniband's advantages over Ethernet in terms of bandwidth and latency for high-performance computing.

There is also a discussion on various networking technologies such as wired Ethernet, WiFi, and fiber optic connections. Users share insights on the speeds and reliability of these technologies in different use cases, with some emphasizing the importance of proper infrastructure for optimal performance.

Additionally, there are comments debating the implications of Nvidia's choice of proprietary technologies and the potential challenges it poses for customers in terms of vendor lock-in. Some users express skepticism about Nvidia's motivations behind sticking with proprietary solutions, while others argue that it aligns with the company's strategic interests.

Overall, the discussion delves into the technical aspects and implications of networking technologies, vendor lock-in, and strategic decisions in the tech industry, providing diverse perspectives on the topic.
