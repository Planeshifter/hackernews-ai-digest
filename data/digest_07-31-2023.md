### Show HN: File distribution over DNS: (ab)using DNS as a CDN

#### [Submission URL](https://eighty-twenty.org/2023/07/31/dns-as-a-cdn) | 60 points | by [tonyg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tonyg) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36945177)

A developer woke up one Saturday with an idea to use content-defined chunking (CDC) and serve the chunks over DNS. After only one weekend of hacking, the idea turned into a working project called NSCDN. NSCDN utilizes the Ronomon variant of FastCDC, a content-defined chunking algorithm, to split large files into chunks. Each chunk is then served as a separate DNS TXT record associated with a domain label. The chunks are cached by DNS resolvers, resulting in efficient scaleout and incremental updates. The project includes an NSCDN server implemented in Golang that stores the DNS records in an SQLite database. The developer notes that while this may not be the most efficient way to transfer files, it seems to work well in limited testing and offers the advantage of caching resolvers.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the feasibility and potential issues with NSCDN, the project created by the developer.

Bioengineers at the University of Pennsylvania have used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify antimicrobial peptides from proteins found in Neanderthals and Denisovans, which could inspire new drugs to treat human infections. The researchers trained an AI algorithm to recognize sites on human proteins where they are known to be cut into peptides, and used the properties of previously-described antimicrobial peptides to predict new peptides that might kill bacteria. Testing dozens of peptides, the team found that all six potent peptides stopped the growth of bacteria in laboratory dishes, and five molecules killed bacteria growing in skin abscesses. The researchers believe that tweaking the most successful molecules and improving the algorithm could lead to more effective versions. Although some experts have questioned the clinical relevance of this approach, others have praised the study for its innovation in the field of antibiotic development.
