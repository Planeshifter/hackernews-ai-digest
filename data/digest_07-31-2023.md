Machine learning researchers have been experimenting with large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT for a few years, but it was only recently that the general public began to grasp their power. However, not many people understand how these models work. LLMs are trained to predict the next word and require vast amounts of text to do so, but the details behind their predictions are often deemed mysterious. This is because LLMs are built on neural networks trained with billions of words, making it challenging for humans to fully comprehend their inner workings. Despite this, experts understand a lot about LLMs and aim to make this knowledge accessible to a broader audience. Word vectors play a crucial role in these models, representing words as long lists of numbers. These vectors allow LLMs to reason about language, similar to how coordinates represent locations on a map. By understanding word vectors and diving into the transformer, which is the foundation of models like ChatGPT, experts hope to shed light on the inner workings of LLMs.

The discussion begins with a user named "version_five" highlighting the complexity of understanding the inner workings of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. They explain that LLMs utilize word vectors and transformer models, which make it challenging for humans to comprehend due to the vast amount of training data involved. In response, a user named "bnrybts" points out that the steps depicted in the submission may not apply directly to a specific LLM, as different models may modify hidden states differently to reflect context. Another user named "llm_nerd" agrees with this perspective, stating that the submission's alternative suggestion for learning about LLMs may not cater to a broad audience. They express surprise over the submission's relevance on Hacker News, suggesting that it may be more suitable for a niche scientific community.

The discussion takes a brief sidebar as a user named "frtzthdv" expresses gratitude for the submission and its information.
