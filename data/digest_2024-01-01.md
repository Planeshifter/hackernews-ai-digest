#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Dec/31/ai-in-2023/) | 194 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [124 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38828594)

In 2023, Large Language Models (LLMs) emerged as the breakthrough in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Simon Willison, a prominent AI researcher, highlights the key findings and advancements in this area. LLMs are surprisingly easy to build, requiring just a few hundred lines of Python code and a substantial amount of training data. While initially only accessible to organizations like OpenAI, the cost of training LLMs has decreased significantly, making it more attainable for a broader range of people. Additionally, LLMs can now be run on personal devices, including laptops and iPhones, thanks to recent advancements in technology. Hobbyists can also fine-tune existing models to suit their needs and share their creations with the wider community. Despite these achievements, the quest for a superior model to GPT-4 remains ongoing, with several contenders making claims of improved performance. The ethical implications of LLMs also remain complex and under examination.

The discussion on this submission mainly revolves around the claims made in the initial summary. Some users express skepticism about the actual complexity and significance of building a large language model (LLM) in just 500 lines of code, while others argue that it is possible due to the tools and frameworks available. The debate also touches on the concept of Boltzmann Brains and their relevance to LLMs. Additionally, some users discuss the potential of LLMs in improving AI discussions and their applications in understanding human intelligence. A few users also share their personal experiences related to brain injuries and how they affect cognitive abilities.

### An AI Future Is Much Shakier Than You Think

#### [Submission URL](https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/12/31/artificial-intelligence-ai-future-chatgpt-napster-internet/) | 24 points | by [cbzbc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cbzbc) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38833644)

In an article titled "An AI Future Is Much Shakier Than You Think," Dave Karpf, an associate professor at George Washington University, draws parallels between the early days of Napster and the current state of artificial intelligence (AI). Karpf suggests that while AI tools like ChatGPT are seen as the future, we may soon be reminded of failed digital futures. Napster was a peer-to-peer file sharing service that allowed users to freely download music, causing concern in the music industry about the impact on sales and artists' livelihoods. Karpf argues that the music industry ultimately adapted to the new digital landscape, but not necessarily to the benefit of musicians. He draws a parallel with AI, noting that while tools like ChatGPT have gained popularity, the legal and ethical implications surrounding AI are still uncertain. Karpf suggests that the future of AI may be shaped by negotiations and compromises, similar to what happened with digital music.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the comparison between the early days of Napster and the current state of AI. One user points out that the comparison is a bit flawed since file sharing was a decentralized, open-source community-driven effort, whereas AI development is controlled by entities like OpenAI. They argue that OpenAI's decision to restrict access to ChatGPT shows that there are still copyright laws in place and that the comparison to Napster doesn't hold. Another user counters this argument by stating that in the past twenty years, technology development has led to relentless consolidation and re-centralization, suggesting that the comparison is still relevant. They also mention that the music industry adapted to the rise of streaming services, but not necessarily in a way that benefited artists.

Overall, the discussion highlights differing opinions on whether the comparison between Napster and AI is valid and whether the future of AI will follow a similar trajectory.
