### Android devices with backdoored firmware found in US schools

#### [Submission URL](https://www.securityweek.com/android-devices-with-backdoored-firmware-found-in-us-schools/) | 142 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37797679)

Tens of thousands of Android devices have been shipped with backdoored firmware, according to cybersecurity vendor Human Security. The devices were infected with the Triada malware, which allows threat actors to carry out various ad-fraud schemes. The Android devices in question were found on public school networks throughout the US. Human Security says that the backdoor cannot be cleaned by end-users, as it resides in the firmware partition. The cybersecurity firm managed to disrupt the ad fraud scheme and take down the command-and-control servers associated with it. However, the BadBox operators may adapt and circumvent the defensive measures put in place.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of the backdoored firmware found on Android devices. Some users discuss the impact on non-US companies and the importance of protecting manufacturer brands. Others discuss the possible involvement of Chinese manufacturers and draw comparisons to similar incidents involving Western brands. There is also discussion about the security implications for Android devices in military and government institutions. Additionally, there are discussions about the role of third-party software distribution channels and the potential risks involved. Some users raise concerns about Apple's approach to third-party software and the limitations of the App Store's checks for private APIs.

### OpenAI is exploring making its own AI chips

#### [Submission URL](https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-owner-openai-is-exploring-making-its-own-ai-chips-sources-2023-10-06/) | 107 points | by [rasbt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rasbt) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37790058)

OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is reportedly considering developing its own artificial intelligence chips and has even evaluated potential acquisition targets. OpenAI has been facing a shortage of expensive AI chips and is exploring different options to address this issue, including building its own chip and collaborating with other chipmakers. CEO Sam Altman has made acquiring more AI chips a top priority for the company due to the scarcity and high costs associated with running the hardware necessary for its AI efforts. While OpenAI has not made a final decision on whether to proceed with developing its own chip, the company's interest in this area aligns it with other tech giants like Google and Amazon that have sought to design their own chips. Acquiring a chip company could potentially accelerate the process for OpenAI. However, if OpenAI does decide to develop a custom chip, it would be a significant and costly undertaking that may take several years. In the meantime, the company would still rely on commercial chip providers like Nvidia and AMD. The demand for specialized AI chips has surged since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, and Nvidia currently dominates the market for these chips.

Discussion Summary:

- Some users expressed skepticism about OpenAI's interest in developing its own chips, suggesting that they should focus on alternative strategies like partnering with existing chip suppliers.
- Others pointed out that OpenAI's interest in building its own chips aligns with the strategies of tech giants like Google and Amazon, who have also designed their own chips for AI purposes.
- There was speculation about whether OpenAI might consider acquiring a chip company to accelerate the process, similar to how Apple acquired Turi in 2016 to enhance its AI capabilities.
- Some users discussed the potential benefits of vertically integrating hardware and software, while others cautioned that it could distract from OpenAI's primary focus on AI research.
- The shortage and high cost of AI chips were mentioned as driving factors behind OpenAI's interest in developing its own chips.
- The discussion also touched on topics like the limitations of current AI models, the role of specialized chips in AI processing, and the challenges of integrating natural language models directly into hardware.

### Make smooth AI generated videos with AnimateDiff and an interpolator

#### [Submission URL](https://replicate.com/blog/animatediff-interpolator) | 24 points | by [bfirsh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bfirsh) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37794099)

The blog post titled "Make smooth AI generated videos with AnimateDiff and an interpolator" provides a detailed guide on combining AnimateDiff and the ST-MFNet frame interpolator to create realistic and smooth videos from a text prompt. AnimateDiff enhances text-to-image models by adding a motion modeling module trained on video clips, allowing for animated outputs. The blog post also introduces LoRAs, lightweight extensions that provide efficient camera movement controls for AnimateDiff. Additionally, the article explains how ST-MFNet, a spatio-temporal multi-flow network for frame interpolation, can be used to increase the frame rate and create smoother videos. The post provides code examples for using AnimateDiff, ST-MFNet, and the Replicate API to create these AI-generated videos. The authors invite readers to share their creations on Discord or via Twitter.

The discussion about the submission mostly revolves around technical and philosophical aspects related to the use of AI and the quality of the generated videos. One commenter expresses skepticism about the marketability of tools like AnimateDiff, arguing that it may not appeal to a wide audience. Another user criticizes the quality of the videos generated by the tool.  In response to a comment, a user suggests that previous versions of AnimateDiff had more stable diffusion animations. Another commenter raises concerns about the computational requirements of running AI models, particularly in relation to hardware capabilities. One user shares a link to a related article discussing limitations and potential advancements of animation tools like AnimateDiff. In a separate comment, a user humorously suggests that using hallucinogens like LSD or mushrooms might be a way to create more realistic simulations.
