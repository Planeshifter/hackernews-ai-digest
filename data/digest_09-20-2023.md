#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/kantord/SeaGOAT) | 232 points | by [kantord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kantord) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37583219)

SeaGOAT is a powerful code search engine that uses vector embeddings to enable semantic code searching in your codebase. Developed by GitHub user kantord, SeaGOAT is designed to help developers quickly find specific pieces of code by understanding the meaning behind the code, rather than relying on traditional keyword-based searches. The tool is built to be fast and efficient, making it suitable for both small and large codebases.

The main advantage of SeaGOAT is its local-first approach, meaning that it runs entirely on your local machine without sending your code or queries to any external servers. This ensures that your code remains secure and private. SeaGOAT supports multiple programming languages and can be easily integrated into your development workflow.

To use SeaGOAT, you need to install Python 3.11 or newer, as well as the dependencies ripgrep and bat (optional, but recommended). Once installed, you can start the SeaGOAT server and use the "gt" or "seagoat" command to query your code repository. You can search for code snippets based on their semantic meaning or use regular expressions for more specific searches.

SeaGOAT is actively developed and maintained, and the GitHub repository includes detailed documentation on how to get started, install dependencies, run tests, and contribute to the project. It's worth noting that the developer behind SeaGOAT, kantord, is actively seeking new job opportunities as a Senior Full Stack Developer and has over 10 years of professional software development experience.

If you're looking for a powerful code search engine that combines the benefits of semantic searching with privacy and control, SeaGOAT might be the solution you've been searching for. Check out the GitHub repository for installation instructions and more information on how to use SeaGOAT in your development workflow.

### Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-Gram, Positional

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04827) | 104 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [52 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37583136)

A recent paper titled "Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional" analyzes the behavior of neurons in large language models. The researchers focus on the OPT family of models, ranging from 125m to 66b parameters, and study whether an FFN neuron is activated or not. They find that the early part of the network is sparse and represents discrete features, with a significant percentage of neurons being "dead," meaning they never activate on diverse data. The researchers also observe that alive neurons in these models serve as token and n-gram detectors and that the corresponding FFN updates remove information about triggering tokens. Interestingly, this is the first example of mechanisms specialized in removing information from the residual stream. As models scale, they become even more sparse, with a higher number of dead neurons and token detectors. Finally, the researchers identify positional neurons, which are activated or not depending largely on position rather than textual data.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to artificial neural networks and their behavior. 

- Some commenters discuss the concept of dead neurons and their association with ReLU networks. There is a debate about whether dead neurons are actually beneficial or not in network regularization. Anecdotal evidence and alternative activation functions such as Leaky ReLUs and Mish are also mentioned.
- The understanding of artificial neural networks and how they process input data is questioned. It is noted that the researchers may not fully understand the concept of artificial neurons and their role in categorizing and decoding data. The discussion touches on common arguments and comments regarding the reduction of models' size and the removal of dead neurons.
- Commenters discuss the potential methods for reducing model size by tracking neuron activation frequency during training or through weight pruning techniques. Examples of K-Means algorithms and clustering centers are mentioned as ways to regularize dead neurons.
- The topic of pruning in neural networks is brought up. Structured pruning is mentioned as a method to remove weights with minimal impact on quality, and there is a suggestion that randomization or column removal during training can also be effective.
- The complexity and challenges of pruning networks are discussed, with some mention of methods like activation pruning and weight pruning. The trade-off between accuracy and efficiency is acknowledged, and the penalties for sparsity in neural networks are mentioned.
- There is a discussion of the limitations and capabilities of artificial neural networks compared to human brain function. Commenters express surprise at the ability of neural networks to approximate human-level functioning in tasks like visual recognition and pattern matching. The importance of reinforcement learning and alignment in human intelligence is also mentioned.
- The topic of simulating real neurons and their complexities is brought up. Commenters note that accurately simulating the behavior of neurons and their connectivity in the brain is difficult and that mapping neural connectivity is a challenging task.
- The concept of qualia, consciousness, and the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence are briefly discussed, with some mention of the complexity of understanding and replicating certain aspects of human cognition.
- Finally, there are discussions about the logic capabilities of individual neurons and the complexity of XOR logic in neural networks. Some commenters mention that XOR logic can be achieved by single-layer perceptrons, while others propose that XOR logic is not a breakthrough and that the problem of NP-hardness still exists.

A team of mathematicians from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology have developed a computer algorithm that has discovered an unprecedented number of continued fraction formulas for fundamental mathematical constants. The algorithm, which utilizes thousands of personal computers worldwide, has revealed a novel mathematical structure called the conservative matrix field. This field unifies thousands of existing formulas, generates infinitely many new formulas, and unveils unexpected relations between different mathematical constants. The algorithm's discoveries also enable new mathematical proofs of irrationality and can be used to generalize proofs for the irrationality of specific constants.
