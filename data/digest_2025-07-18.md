In a bold move, Meta Platforms has refused to sign the European Union’s new artificial intelligence code of practice, citing concerns that it overregulates and could hinder innovation. Joel Kaplan, Meta’s global affairs chief, voiced these objections on LinkedIn, emphasizing that Europe might be taking an ill-advised approach to AI regulation. The EU's guidelines aim to support compliance with the AI Act, which seeks to enhance transparency and safety in the AI sector. However, Meta believes the new code introduces unnecessary legal ambiguities and stretches beyond the act’s original intent.

Despite Meta’s refusal, companies like OpenAI have agreed to the EU’s regulations, even as others like ASML Holding and Airbus push for a delay. Kaplan argues that over-regulation could stifle the development and application of cutting-edge AI models across Europe, hampering business growth. This debate highlights the tension between regulatory frameworks and technological advancement, with Meta taking a firm stand against what it sees as legislative overreach. The decision comes amidst broader shifts in Meta’s AI strategy, marking a noteworthy stance in the ongoing dialogue about AI regulation.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Meta's refusal to adopt the EU’s AI code of practice centers on several key debates:

1. **Copyright and Regulation**:  
   - Participants argue about whether copyright laws are effective economic incentives for creators or tools that disproportionately benefit large corporations. Some assert that modern copyright terms (e.g., 250 years in the EU) are excessive and fail to protect small creators. Critics suggest these laws enable "wealth transfers" to AI firms and media giants, stifling open-source innovation and public access to knowledge.

2. **Practicality of Compliance**:  
   - Skepticism exists about enforcing regulations on AI-generated content, given the sheer volume of outputs. Some users label compliance as "impractical," while others argue standardized interfaces and clearer consent mechanisms (e.g., GDPR-style cookie banners) could streamline adherence. Dark patterns and overly complex policies were cited as barriers to genuine user consent.

3. **EU’s Regulatory Approach**:  
   - Meta’s stance resonated with commenters who view EU regulations as overreach that could stifle innovation. Critics likened the rules to "policy grabs" favoring corporate interests, while supporters emphasized the need to balance accountability and transparency. Concerns were raised that the EU’s focus on copyright might distract from broader issues like privacy and equitable data access.

4. **Government Role and Power**:  
   - Debates emerged over whether governments enforce regulations to protect public interests or powerful entities. Some saw copyright as a government-granted monopoly, while anarchist-leaning users dismissed intellectual property as a social construct. The EU’s multilingual legal framework was noted as a challenge, requiring courts to interpret laws contextually rather than verbatim.

5. **Meta’s Strategic Position**:  
   - Meta’s refusal was framed as part of a broader resistance to ceding control over AI development. Commenters speculated that the EU’s regulations might inadvertently disadvantage smaller players while failing to rein in dominant tech firms. The tension between innovation and regulation was highlighted as pivotal in shaping the future of AI governance.

Ultimately, the discussion reflects a clash between skepticism toward regulatory efficacy and calls for balanced frameworks that protect creators without hampering technological progress.

### AI capex is so big that it's affecting economic statistics

#### [Submission URL](https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/) | 334 points | by [throw0101c](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throw0101c) | [324 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44609130)

In today's digital economy, there's a new heavyweight contender vying for a historic role: AI Capex. Writer Paul Kedrosky's latest piece delves into the gargantuan impact that capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, particularly datacenters, are having on the U.S. economy. With AI capex poised to account for approximately 2% of U.S. GDP in 2025, the implications are as profound as they are widespread—a spending spree reminiscent of the monumental railroad boom of the 19th century.

Kedrosky unravels how this surge in spending, led by tech giants like Nvidia, is transforming economic landscapes, hinting at an unintended economic reshuffling. The potential 0.7% contribution to GDP growth from AI alone represents not just a boon, but a redirection of capital flows that have significant repercussions. While this revolution fast-tracks AI advancements, it invariably starves other sectors, notably infrastructure, similar to the telecom capex bubble of the dot-com era.

China takes notice too. President Xi Jinping's recent cautionary tone underscores the international ripple effects: as over 250 new datacenters rise on Chinese soil, he questions if every province should jump on the AI bandwagon. The conversation around AI capex is expanding beyond boardrooms to global leaders, signaling a pivotal shift in how countries approach industrial investments.

Kedrosky's analysis doesn’t stop at mere economics; it highlights the financial acrobatics companies perform to fund these expenditures. From equity offerings to special-purpose vehicles, firms are pulling levers that reroute traditional pathways of capital allocation. While exciting, this development calls for a careful weighing of priorities, lest critical infrastructure falter in the shadows of AI's dazzling promise.

In this dynamic narrative of technological expansion, earmarking AI as the "industry of the century" might not be hyperbolic. The key lies in managing its momentum intelligently, ensuring an equilibrium that benefits the wider economic infrastructure, and not just its silicon-filled datacenters. As Kedrosky suggests, we're still climbing the peak, and the ascent is reshaping industries as it elevates economies.

**Discussion Summary:**  
The comment thread debates the significance of AI Capex contributing ~2% to U.S. GDP by 2025, drawing historical comparisons to programs like Apollo (4% GDP) and railroads (6% GDP). Users note that wartime spending (WWII: 40% GDP) and COVID stimuli (27% GDP) dwarf AI’s projected impact. Critics argue that framing AI Capex as transformative overlooks past precedents.  

A contentious tangent revolves around sectors like financial services (9% of GDP) and healthcare (20% of GDP). Some users dismiss financial services as inefficient overhead, criticizing Visa/Mastercard’s high profit margins (50%), while others defend them as essential for capital allocation and consumer convenience. Healthcare spending comparisons between countries (e.g., U.S. vs. Spain) highlight disparities in cost-effectiveness and life expectancy outcomes.  

Debates on economic efficiency question centralized planning in large corporations versus market-driven models. Proponents of decentralization argue for competitive efficiency, while skeptics cite monopolistic tendencies. A linked video posits financial services enable "unrealistic consumption" in wealthy nations, sparking disagreements over whether this reflects systemic waste or legitimate economic value.  

Ultimately, the thread reflects skepticism toward hyping AI Capex as revolutionary, urging caution against prioritizing tech investment over critical infrastructure, mirroring past bubbles like the dot-com era. Financial and healthcare sectors’ GDP shares remain hotly contested, illustrating broader tensions between growth narratives and equitable resource allocation.
