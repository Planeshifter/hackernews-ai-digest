### What's up with this new memory_order_consume memory order?

#### [Submission URL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20230427-00/?p=108107) | 58 points | by [luu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=luu) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36040457)

C++20 has introduced a new atomic memory order called std::memory_order_consume or "consume", which is a weaker form of the existing std::memory_order::acquire. While the acquire order prevents all future memory accesses from being reordered ahead of the load, consume only prevents dependent future memory accesses from being reordered. The consume order is not widely used as atomic variables are typically tied to other variables in ways that don't depend on expression dependency graphs. However, consume is useful when weaker memory ordering than acquire is required without invoking undefined behavior.

The consume order is not widely used as atomic variables are typically tied to other variables in ways that don't depend on expression dependency graphs. It is useful when weaker memory ordering than acquire is required without invoking undefined behavior. Users should note that consume does not have a guarantee on non-TSO machines. The discussion follows the specifics of this implementation in various architectures, as well as its performance and practical uses in C++ and Rust.

### RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13048) | 349 points | by [ianbutler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ianbutler) | [170 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36038868)

A new paper titled "RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era" has been submitted to arXiv by Bo Peng and 29 other authors. The publication explores an innovative model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), which combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. The architecture uses a linear attention mechanism that allows the model to be formulated as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. This groundbreaking approach leads to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters and performs on par with similarly sized Transformers. The research presents a significant step towards reconciling the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.

### Generating Music Tracks with Unified Representation and Diffusion Framework

#### [Submission URL](https://ai-muzic.github.io/getmusic/) | 96 points | by [laurieg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=laurieg) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36038945)

Researchers have proposed a unified model for generating any type of music track. The model, called GETMusic, uses a novel music representation called GETScore, which organizes notes as tokens in a 2D structure with tracks progressing horizontally over time. During training, tracks are randomly selected as source or target, and in the forward process, target tracks are masked and corrupted while source tracks remain as ground truth. GETDiff, a diffusion model, then learns to predict the masked target tokens conditioned on the source tracks. The experiments showed that GETMusic provides high-quality results across diverse combinations and surpasses prior works for some specific combinations.

### Hot Pixels: Frequency, Power, and Temperature Attacks on GPUs and ARM SoCs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12784) | 14 points | by [ManDeJan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ManDeJan) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36040758)

A team of researchers has conducted a study showing that GPUs and ARM SoCs are vulnerable to information leakage via power, temperature, and frequency through internal sensors. These hybrid side-channel attacks can bypass countermeasures for traditional microarchitectural side-channel attacks and allow attackers to steal pixels from a website in the browser, without elevated privileges. The paper presents real-world JavaScript-based pixel stealing and history sniffing attacks on Chrome and Safari, with all side channel countermeasures enabled, as well as website fingerprinting attacks. The findings reveal the need for improved security measures for these devices.

The discussion on this submission explored how the vulnerabilities described in the study are related to power consumption, temperature, and frequency. Some commenters noted that similar attacks have been mitigated in the past by balancing electrical power consumption and improving energy efficiency, while others pointed out that concurrent computational loads and fuzzy fonts can also affect security. There were also references made to related attacks such as the TEMPEST and Hertzbleed attacks that have been presented at conferences and the impact of hot pixels. Matthew Green's Twitter account was also mentioned for further reading on the topic.
