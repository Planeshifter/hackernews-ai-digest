Meilisearch, a full-text search engine, is expanding its search capabilities with Arroy's filtered disk. In order to support filtering and selecting subsets of documents, Meilisearch needed to develop a filtering system that can handle large datasets and provide scalability and responsiveness. One of their clients required the ability to filter through over 100 million YouTube video metadata and associated image embeddings to select videos released within specific time frames. 

Previously, Meilisearch ranked only the subset of filtered documents, but now with Arroy's filtered disk, they needed to implement a more efficient method. They were using an in-memory HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) data structure, but it was inefficient. They had to deserialize the whole data structure in memory, which took a lot of time and memory. Additionally, Meilisearch supports multiple vectors by document, so they needed to look up every vector they were iterating, which was not ideal.

With Arroy, Meilisearch was able to integrate the new vector store more quickly through mob programming, where the team codes together at the same time. Arroy provided a smarter search engine that can determine the exact number of results to return, even with filters to consider.

Arroy's internal data structure consists of item nodes (original vectors), normal nodes (split planes), and descendant nodes (tree leaves composed of item IDs). During a search, the algorithm pops the nearest item from a binary heap associated with an infinite distance. The modified Arroy stores the list of descendants in RoaringBitmaps, which are more efficient and allow for easier intersection with the filtered subset of documents.

One challenge Meilisearch faced was that vector IDs are not the same as document IDs, and Meilisearch only knows about the documents after executing the filters. Iterating on a lookup table to construct the final bitmap with all the vector IDs corresponding to the filtered documents would not be efficient, especially when many documents are part of the subset. To address this, Meilisearch used multiple indexes for efficient filtering.

Overall, the integration of Arroy in Meilisearch improved their search tool and highlighted the importance of collaboration and teamwork when facing technical challenges.

There are several discussions taking place in the comments section of the submission about Meilisearch's integration of Arroy's filtered disk. Here is a summary of the key points:

- One commenter suggests that Meilisearch should provide more information about their indexing process, and another mentions that they should discuss it on Discord. It is noted that Meilisearch has improved its indexing speed in version 16, and links to blog posts and tweets are shared to provide more details.
- Another commenter mentions that they recently re-indexed comments in Meilisearch using PHP and synchronized the data with MYSQL. They also mention upgrading to the latest version and mention the indexing speed.
- There is a discussion about the use of RoaringBitmaps in Meilisearch. One commenter finds it interesting as it offers benefits such as memory traversal, while another commenter raises questions about the design choices and suggests considering benchmarks.
- The expansion of Meilisearch's hybrid search capabilities is mentioned, and one commenter agrees that it's a great addition. They also suggest that Meilisearch should consider introducing replication clusters for high availability.
- A commenter shares their plan to use Markdown Astro and Seveltkit SSG to generate an index for searching with Meilisearch.
- A brief discussion about the disk space improvement in Meilisearch is mentioned.
- The topic of product placement in the blog post is brought up by a commenter, to which the original poster replies that Meilisearch works hard and mentions the various search features in different versions.
- There is a suggestion to use bundled libraries like SQLite or PostgreSQL for Meilisearch's storage needs, and another commenter mentions running a local bundled app.

Overall, the comments discuss various aspects of Meilisearch's integration of Arroy's filtered disk, including indexing speed, design choices, hybrid search capabilities, storage solutions, and future developments.
