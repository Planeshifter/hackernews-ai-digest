### Grokking at the edge of linear separability

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04489) | 89 points | by [marojejian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marojejian) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41810753)

In a recent paper titled "Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability," researchers Alon Beck, Noam Levi, and Yohai Bar-Sinai delve into the nuanced dynamics of binary logistic classification. The study emphasizes the concept of "grokking," which describes the delayed generalization and non-monotonic test loss often observed during the training of machine learning models. Through both empirical analysis and theoretical exploration, the authors reveal that grokking is particularly pronounced in training datasets that are on the cusp of linear separability.

Key findings indicate that while a perfect generalizing solution always exists, models tend to overfit when data is linearly separable from the origin. Conversely, in cases where the data is not separable from the origin, the model can achieve perfect generalization over time, although early-stage overfitting is still possible. The research highlights the critical transition point, where models may linger in overfitting before ultimately generalizing—a phenomenon reminiscent of critical behavior in physical systems.

By also examining a simplified one-dimensional model to capture essential characteristics, this paper contributes to our understanding of how machine learning models relate to theoretical frameworks within their performance dynamics. This offers fresh insights into the complex interplay of training conditions and model behavior, echoing trends seen in contemporary machine learning literature.

The discussion around the paper "Grokking at the Edge of Linear Separability" on Hacker News brings out several perspectives regarding the phenomenon of grokking in machine learning, especially in the context of neural networks and classification. A few key points from the dialogue include:

1. **Understanding Grokking**: Many commenters expressed interest in the concept of grokking, which describes the delayed generalization observed during training when a model initially overfits before learning to generalize effectively. The dialogue highlighted parallels between grokking and critical points in physical systems.

2. **Implications for Neural Networks**: There was an emphasis on how grokking relates to the structure of neural networks and their dynamics. Comments referenced how the architecture and training of these models can affect their ability to reach generalization and relate to the behavior of critical systems in statistical mechanics.

3. **Simplification Models**: The use of simplified models in the paper was noted as a beneficial approach for understanding complex behaviors seen in higher-dimensional networks. Several participants mentioned that investigating these simpler scenarios can lead to valuable insights.

4. **Mathematical Considerations**: Commenters explored the mathematical foundations of grokking, including the implications of weight decay and the dynamics of decision boundaries in relation to the thresholds of linear separability. Discussions about specific transformations (like ReLU activation) and decision-making processes in neural networks were common.

5. **Criticality and Overfitting**: The connection made between criticality, overfitting, and grokking drew interest as it resonates with broader research themes in machine learning. Participants speculated on how understanding these interactions could yield strategies to improve model training and performance.

Overall, the discussion showcased a vibrant engagement with the paper's themes, advancing a deeper understanding of the interplay between model training dynamics and their broader implications in machine learning.
