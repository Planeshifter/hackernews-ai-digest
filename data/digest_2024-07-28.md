In an exciting development for the world of theorem proving, researchers have introduced LeanDojo, a platform that harnesses the power of language models as copilots to automate proof generation in Lean—a popular theorem proving environment. LeanDojo offers users the ability to interact with their own models, whether they run locally or in the cloud, enhancing the proof process by suggestive tactics and premise retrieval.

At the heart of LeanDojo is the ReProver model, which employs a sophisticated encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to navigate the complexities of theorem proving. By utilizing an extensive benchmark dataset—comprised of nearly 100,000 theorems, along with tens of thousands of tactics and premises from Lean's rich math library—ReProver demonstrates remarkable capabilities, outperforming traditional built-in tactics as well as zero-shot attempts with models like GPT-4.

LeanDojo also creates a gym-like environment for theorem provers, facilitating interactions with proof states and tactics while providing feedback on errors or completion status. In addition to generating new proofs—discovering 33 previously unproven statements in miniF2F and 39 in ProofNet—it has been instrumental in uncovering formalization bugs.

A unique feature of LeanDojo is its integration with ChatGPT, offering users a more conversational approach to theorem proving. While ChatGPT can intersperse informal discussions with formal proof steps, it currently struggles with complex proofs compared to specialized models like ReProver.

With these advancements, LeanDojo paves the way for a new era in theorem proving, expanding the potential for both formal verification and mathematical exploration.
