### Show HN: Carton â€“ Run any ML model from any programming language

#### [Submission URL](https://carton.run) | 174 points | by [vpanyam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vpanyam) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37682286)

Carton is an open-source API that allows you to run any machine learning (ML) model from any programming language. It provides a single API for all frameworks, making it easy to work with models regardless of the language you're using.

The process starts by packing your model with Carton. This involves wrapping your model with some metadata and putting it in a zip file. Importantly, Carton doesn't modify the original model, avoiding error-prone conversion steps. You just need to specify the framework and the required version, and Carton takes care of the rest.

Once your model is packed, you can load it using Carton. The API reads the metadata included in the packed model to determine the appropriate "runner" to use. If needed, Carton automatically fetches the right runner. A runner is a component of Carton that knows how to run a model with a specific version of an ML framework.

With your model loaded, you can then run inference using Carton's framework-agnostic API. Your application calls into Carton, which in turn calls the underlying framework to execute the model. Carton is implemented in Rust with bindings to several languages, all using the same optimized core.

Carton has been designed with performance in mind. Most of its code is implemented in optimized async Rust, resulting in low overhead. Preliminary benchmarks show that the overhead per inference call is less than 100 microseconds. Furthermore, the Carton team is actively working on further optimizing the system with improved use of Shared Memory, which will bring overhead levels even lower for models with large inputs.

In terms of platform support, Carton currently works on x86_64 Linux and macOS, aarch64 Linux (e.g., Linux on AWS Graviton), aarch64 macOS (e.g., M1 and M2 Apple Silicon chips), and WebAssembly (though for now, only metadata access is supported, with WebGPU runners coming soon).

So why should you use Carton instead of directly using frameworks like Torch or TensorFlow? Carton decouples your inference code from specific frameworks, treating them as implementation details. This allows you to easily keep up with the cutting-edge developments in the ML field. Additionally, while ONNX converts models, Carton wraps them, using the underlying framework to execute the model. This makes it easy to use custom operations, TensorRT, and other framework-specific features without making changes. Carton aims to support ONNX models in the future, enabling even more use cases, such as running models in the browser with WebAssembly (WASM).

In summary, Carton provides a convenient and efficient way to run ML models from any programming language. Its framework-agnostic API, optimized performance, and support for multiple platforms make it a powerful tool for ML deployment and experimentation.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News covers various aspects of the Carton API. Here are some key points from the comments:

- Some users mentioned other tools and frameworks that can be used for running machine learning (ML) models, such as Docker, Nvidias Triton, TensorFlow Java support, and ONNX.
- There was a discussion about the benefits of using Carton over directly using frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow. Carton provides a framework-agnostic API, making it easier to keep up with developments in the ML field. It also allows the use of custom operations and framework-specific features without modification. It was noted that Carton aims to support ONNX models in the future.
- Users asked about platform support, with some expressing interest in Windows support. The current platforms supported by Carton include x86_64 Linux and macOS, aarch64 Linux, aarch64 macOS, and WebAssembly.
- The performance of Carton was discussed, with preliminary benchmarks showing low overhead per inference call. The Carton team is actively working on further optimizing the system.
- Some users raised questions about the use of zip files for packaging models, noting that other container formats like Docker or compressed files could be more suitable.
- There were discussions about the challenges of running ML models and the benefits of using containerization technologies.
- There was interest in the potential use of Carton for running ML models on GPUs, and the Carton team acknowledged the importance of GPU support.

Overall, the discussion revolved around the capabilities, performance, platform support, and potential use cases of the Carton API, with users sharing their thoughts and asking questions about its features and advantages.

### ZipPy: Detect AI-generated text quickly via compression ratios

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/thinkst/zippy) | 24 points | by [makeworld](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=makeworld) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37682872)

The ZipPy project by thinkst aims to detect AI-generated text using compression ratios. The idea is to measure the perplexity of a text by calculating the compression ratios using LZMA or zlib compression algorithms. The project explores the use of compression as an approximate method for detecting low-perplexity text, which could indicate AI-generated content. By comparing the compression ratios of a seed corpus of AI-generated text to that of the sample text, the project can determine if the sample text closely resembles AI-generated content.

1. One commenter, "bstwhz," believes that detecting single blob text generated by AI is practically impossible. They suggest that a practical approach would be to determine multiple blobs of text and compare them to AI-generated content. They give the example of AI-generated student training reports that may have similar topics or prompts, making it possible to detect statistical similarities. However, they point out that an AI detection system might not be effective in detecting cheating, as it may mistake multiple students rephrasing report content for cheating.
2. Another commenter, "kj," states that this is a clever solution but warns about Goodhart's Law. They argue that if this becomes a widely used measure, AI text generators will optimize their output to pass this specific test, making it less reliable.
3. "bArray" suggests that AI-generated student reports have the potential to completely fool human markers. They mention the example of copying paragraphs from different sources, resulting in an extensive and diverse report that can be generated in a short amount of time, making it challenging to investigate for plagiarism.
