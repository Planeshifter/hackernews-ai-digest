#### [Submission URL](https://nathanzhao.cc/explore-exploit) | 47 points | by [nzhaa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nzhaa) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41816542)

In a thought-provoking blog post, Nathan dives deep into the exploration-exploitation dilemma, a concept that parallels real-world decision-making with machine learning. He uses the framework of the multi-armed bandit problem—where each "arm" represents a different option, much like a slot machine with variable rewards—to illustrate how we can develop strategies that maximize rewards over time. Starting from a state of complete uncertainty (t=0), Nathan explains how decision-makers must initially focus on exploration (ϵ = 1) and gradually shift toward exploitation (ϵ approaches 0) as they accumulate knowledge about the best options.

Nathan introduces a forward dynamics model to optimize this process, which predicts the expected rewards based on previous actions and observed results. This model is crucial for refining decision-making, as it helps in selecting the most promising arms while navigating the delicate balance between sampling new options and capitalizing on known rewards. He concludes by emphasizing the iterative nature of reward prediction and decision-making, highlighting how careful training of the model can lead to improved outcomes over time. This insightful analogy not only sheds light on the complexities of machine learning but also provides a framework applicable to various real-world scenarios.

In a recent submission to arXiv (2403.04571), prominent researchers Yoshua Bengio and Nikolay Malkin explore the potential for creating an AI mathematician that transcends current capabilities in mathematical reasoning. While AI excels in language mastery, it still lags in complex reasoning tasks—a gap this essay seeks to address by delving into the cognitive processes of human mathematicians. 

The authors propose that modern deep learning techniques primarily engage system 1 abilities, which rely on intuition but fall short in system 2 capabilities that involve methodical reasoning and uncertainty management. Through an information-theoretical lens, they ponder what defines an intriguing mathematical statement and how this understanding could inform the design of AI systems that not only prove theorems but also generate novel conjectures. 

Their central thesis posits that a succinct set of theorems could effectively encapsulate a broader array of provable statements, offering a promising direction for future research in AI mathematics.
