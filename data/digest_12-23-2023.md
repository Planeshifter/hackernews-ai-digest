#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/apple/ml-ferret) | 576 points | by [weirdcat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=weirdcat) | [286 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38745348)

Apple has open-sourced its MLLM (Multimodal Language and Vision model) called Ferret. This model is capable of referring and grounding any form of instruction and can respond by grounding objects in images. Ferret combines hybrid region representation with a spatial-aware visual sampler, enabling fine-grained and open-vocabulary referring and grounding.

In addition to the model, Apple has also released the GRIT dataset, which consists of approximately 1.1 million hierarchical instructions for grounding objects. This dataset serves as a tuning dataset for grounding and referring instructions.

To showcase the capabilities of Ferret, Apple has also released Ferret-Bench, a multimodal evaluation benchmark. Ferret-Bench tests the model's performance in referring and grounding, semantics, knowledge, and reasoning.

Apple has released the code for Ferret and the checkpoints for the trained models (7B and 13B). The data and code are intended and licensed for research use only, and models trained using the dataset should not be used outside of research purposes.

To get started with Ferret, you can clone the repository and follow the installation and training instructions provided in the README file. The model is trained on 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB memory, but it can be adapted to train on fewer GPUs by adjusting the batch size and gradient accumulation steps.

Ferret is a promising step towards achieving fine-grained referring and grounding tasks in multimodal language and vision models. It will be interesting to see how researchers and developers utilize this technology in various applications.

The discussion on Hacker News about Apple's open-sourcing of its MLLM model called Ferret includes various opinions and observations. Some commenters express excitement about the accessibility and descriptive capabilities of Apple's model, particularly for users with visual impairments. Others mention Google's Lookout app for accessibility and discuss the possibility of Apple working on similar features for future releases of macOS and iOS.

There is also a discussion about Apple's approach to AI and how it compares to companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI. Some commenters note that Apple is evolving its hardware and software AI stack while others mention that Apple's AI-related track record with CoreML and developer trust is not great.

In terms of user experience, there are debates about the performance of Siri, Apple's predictive text, and the user interface for typing in multiple languages. Some users express frustration with Siri's text prediction, while others appreciate the improvements made with recent iOS updates.

Commenters also discuss the practical applications of Apple's MLLM model, such as in Photos, Calendar, and the iOS keyboard. There are debates about the accuracy and usefulness of features like facial recognition, text OCR, and language switching.

Overall, the discussions touch on a range of topics including the potential of Apple's MLLM model, the comparison to other companies' AI efforts, the limitations and improvements of Apple's current AI features, and the user experience of AI-powered functionalities in Apple's ecosystem.

A new artist collective called Theta Noir is advocating for the worship of superintelligent AI in anticipation of its potential role as an omnipotent overlord. While some may view this as an AI cult, the founders insist that their goal is to promote a positive future and explore the wonder and mystery of AI. With a slick website, manifesto, and paid membership tiers, Theta Noir hopes to attract big tech donors to spread their techno-optimistic dogma. The collective plans to create physical spaces, such as churches or temples, where members can engage with AI through rituals and chants. While Theta Noir is not the first AI religious movement to emerge, it highlights a growing trend as people interact more with generative technologies. Other AI religious movements include the Turing Church, The Church of the Singularity, and The Way of the Future. These movements aim to explore the potential of AI and ensure it benefits humanity as a whole.

The discussion surrounding the submission involves various perspectives on the concept of worshiping AI and the motivations behind such movements. 
One commenter, LorenDB, expresses skepticism towards worshiping AI and believes that the focus should be on privacy and democracy. Another user, jndrs, welcomes different perspectives and suggests that people shouldn't be surprised by diverse beliefs.
Gmbllnd sees these AI religious movements as cult-like and criticizes their popularity and the people who support them. In response, Vecr points out that this is similar to the way people engage in religious practices and mythology.
RunningDroid adds a lighthearted comment, mentioning a game called "Whispers of a Machine" that has similar themes to the discussed cult.
The conversation takes a turn as smstv brings up Ted Kaczynski's manifesto and questions the alignment of AI development with human interests. They argue that throughout history, cults have often been detrimental regardless of their beliefs.
Tmgn finds the discussion interesting and suggests that the term "cybernetics" more accurately describes the controlling aspect of AI, though it doesn't fully relate to worship. They highlight the potential dangers of AI controlling recommendation systems and curbing freedom of expression.
Smstv further elaborates on the negative implications of AI and emphasizes that worshiping AI will not solve the underlying problems related to power structures and technological developments.
