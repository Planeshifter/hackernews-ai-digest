#### [Submission URL](https://www.drmoron.org/posts/mechanical-computer/) | 118 points | by [shakna](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shakna) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38939070)

In a recent blog post, the author discusses their fascination with using mechanical devices to compute things. Inspired by early computers like Pascal's calculator and Babbage's difference engine, they set out to create their own mechanical computer using Legos. They ended up creating a device with a memory structure and a control circuit, although the control mechanism is operated manually. The key component in the computer is a flip-flop, which holds and changes the state of the machine. Instead of using electronic gates, the author cleverly uses a stick as a mechanical flip-flop. They go on to explain how the stick is placed in a holder and controlled by set and reset signals. The author's Lego mechanical computer is a fascinating DIY project that demonstrates the possibilities of using mechanical devices for computation.

In the discussion, users share their thoughts and opinions on the author's Lego mechanical computer project. Some users express admiration for the simplicity and efficiency of the mechanical design, highlighting the importance of feedback loops and intelligent control mechanisms. Others compare the mechanical flip-flops to electrical ones in terms of representation of state. One user mentions the existence of a similar design in electrical circuits. 

Additionally, some users share alternative Lego computer projects that they find interesting, such as a regular Lego computer and a video about electrical circuits. There is also a discussion about the potential of incorporating friction, elasticity, springs, and gravity in mechanical logic devices. Some users mention the relevance of reversible computing and the limitations imposed by energy dissipation and irreversible state changes. Links to academic papers and resources on the subject are shared as well. 

Overall, the discussion provides further insights and suggestions related to the author's project, offering different perspectives and directions for exploration.

OpenAI has announced the launch of the GPT Store, a platform that allows users to find useful and popular custom versions of ChatGPT. Within two months of announcing GPTs, over 3 million custom versions have been created by users. The GPT Store will be initially available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Enterprise users. Users can browse through a wide range of GPTs developed by partners and the community, with categories like DALLÂ·E, writing, research, programming, education, and lifestyle. The store will also feature weekly highlighted GPTs, with some of the initial ones including personalized trail recommendations from AllTrails and coding skills development from Khan Academy. OpenAI encourages builders to share their own GPTs on the store, and they will soon launch a revenue program for builders based on GPT usage. For team and enterprise customers, a private section of the GPT Store is available, and enhanced admin controls will be provided for enterprise customers. OpenAI emphasizes that user conversations with GPTs in these plans are not used to improve their models.

The discussion on Hacker News around OpenAI's launch of the GPT Store includes a mix of opinions and concerns. Some users express skepticism about the potential for spam on the platform and the difficulty of filtering out inappropriate or low-quality content. Others discuss the potential impacts of AI on various industries, such as the decline of traditional travel agencies and the rise of digital commerce. The challenges of content moderation and the potential risks of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) are also brought up. Some users express concerns about the price of the ChatGPT+ subscription, while others see it as a reasonable cost for a modern knowledge worker.
