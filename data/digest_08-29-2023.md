Researchers from Meta AI and the Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford have introduced a new video motion prediction method called CoTracker. Unlike existing methods that either track points independently or estimate motion jointly using optical flow, CoTracker simultaneously tracks multiple points throughout an entire video. It incorporates ideas from both optical flow and tracking literature and utilizes a transformer network to model the correlation between different points over time. The architecture can be applied to long videos by using a sliding-window approach. CoTracker outperforms state-of-the-art point tracking methods in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The researchers provided visualizations comparing CoTracker with other methods, demonstrating its ability to produce cleaner and more accurate trajectories, particularly in handling occlusions.

LIDA is an automated tool for generating visualizations and infographics from data, and it is now open source on GitHub. This tool uses large language models (LLMs) and image generation models (IGMs) to understand the semantics of data, enumerate visualization goals, and generate visualization specifications. LIDA consists of four modules: a summarizer, a goal explorer, a visgenerator, and an infographer. It supports any programming language or visualization grammar and provides a Python API and a hybrid user interface for interactive chart, infographic, and data story generation. LIDA can summarize data, explore visualization goals, generate visualizations in any grammar, and create stylized infographics. It also offers operations on existing visualizations, such as explanation, self-evaluation, repair, and recommendation. However, LIDA may not work well with visualization grammars that are not well represented in the LLM's training dataset. The performance is also dependent on the choice of visualization libraries and the degrees of freedom granted to the model. LIDA currently requires code execution, so a sandbox environment is recommended to ensure safe execution. LIDA is built using large language models and image generation models. The research paper on LIDA has been accepted at the 2023 ACL Conference. You can try out LIDA locally on your own data now that it is open source on GitHub.
