midihum is a command-line tool that uses machine learning to humanize MIDI compositions. It takes MIDI compositions as input and produces new compositions with adjusted velocity values for each note, resulting in a more natural and expressive sound. The tool uses gradient boosted trees, trained on over 2.6K piano performances, to make the adjustments. 

The creator of midihum has been working on the tool for the past five years and is pleased with its performance, particularly for solo piano works from the Baroque, Classical, and Romantic periods. The tool accurately predicts and captures the dynamics of the music, identifying peaks and valleys in intensity. 

One interesting feature of midihum is that it tends to produce more extreme velocity values than those performed by humans, giving the compositions a unique character. The tool can be easily used through the command line by running a simple command.

The midihum model was trained on performances from the International Piano-e-Competition for young pianists. The tool is distributed with a GPLv3 license, allowing users to freely copy, distribute, and modify the software.

Overall, midihum is a powerful tool for musicians and composers looking to enhance the naturalness and expressiveness of their digital compositions.

### The Heart of a Language Server

#### [Submission URL](https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2023/12/26/the-heart-of-a-language-server.html) | 75 points | by [thesuperbigfrog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thesuperbigfrog) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38820454)

In a recent blog post, "The Heart of a Language Server," the author dives into the intricacies of building a language server. They discuss how language servers, like those used for Kotlin, C#, and Rust, rely on understanding the current position of the cursor to provide features like go to definition, code completion, and more. 

The post explains that the first step in the process is to determine the node in the syntax tree that covers the cursor's offset. Once this is established, semantic analysis is needed to gather additional information. The challenge with semantic analysis is that it often involves multiple layers of intermediate representations that are only indirectly related to the syntax tree.

To bridge this gap, the author proposes a solution using the concept of source spans. By attaching source span information to semantic elements, a language server can find the appropriate semantic element for a given cursor position by iterating over all semantic elements and finding the one with the smallest span that contains the cursor. However, this approach has drawbacks, as it can be slow and can erase information about the underlying syntax trees.

To address these drawbacks, the author introduces an iterative recursive analysis technique. In this approach, each semantic element is assigned a source_syntax method that returns the original syntax node from which it originated. This allows the language server to map syntax nodes to corresponding semantic elements precisely and lazily compute the mapping.

The post provides examples of different approaches to implementing the source_syntax method, including storing a reference to a syntax node, computing the syntax on-demand, or using a side table for mapping. The author notes that all three approaches are used in Rust Analyzer, the language server for Rust.

In conclusion, the post highlights the importance of mapping syntax nodes to semantic elements and the challenges involved in maintaining this mapping. It emphasizes the need for a precise and efficient solution to power language server features effectively.

Discussion:

User "l-mrk" comments that in Rust, finding the parent file that includes a semantic file declaration generally requires the entire file to be parsed. However, source browsers typically parse source files to a certain depth. Another user, "jen20," confirms that this is a path-based structure in C#.

User "brbl" points out that the way Rust, Kotlin, and C# languages start the package declaration immediately impacts the placement of semantic models. They mention that IDE-friendly languages are designed with flexible semantics in mind, making analysis easier. They note that languages like C++, Lisp, and Rust are difficult to analyze compared to languages like Java, Kotlin, and Dart. They further mention that Rust has good support from IDEs, such as Rust Analyzer, which has been helpful in their experience with the language.

User "mtkld" adds that managing the people, master huge efforts require a level of knowledge and expertise in tools proven to be successful. They mention that IntelliJ Rust, the dedicated Rust IDE, and Rust Analyzer are tools that work great because they have dedicated teams working specifically on analyzing Rust and its consequences. They also note that understanding the build IDE is crucial, and it requires a substantial amount of effort.

User "brbl" gives a brief history of the Rust Analyzer project. They mention that the project started in 2017 alongside the existing LSP implementation RLS, which provided IDE support for Rust. They highlight that initially, people completely rejected the idea that Rust Analyzer could succeed and that IDEs worked well with Rust. However, the success of Rust and the efforts of individuals working to improve the tooling led to surprising progress with relatively little effort. They also note that the Rust Analyzer project was initially a hobby project in 2018 and later sponsored by businesses in 2020.

User "glblr-tst" adds that their experience with Lisp shows that despite the IDE experience lacking compared to other languages, the language has great interactivity and good analysis capabilities, especially with tools like SLIME.

User "mrws" comments that semantic information generated from syntax is placed in a linking mechanism and doesn't need to be searched again. They also mention that finding symbols generated by macros can be challenging, and modifying the compiler could make plugins impossible but still necessary.

User "di4na" agrees and adds that analyzers have a problem of growing fast, as compilers extract information. Even regenerating a part of a file based on partial input is not as straightforward due to the correct syntax. They mention that linking is a persistent topic of conversation and the steps taken for transformations need to be well-defined. They also note that it is difficult to query data dependent on transformations. They mention that using the existing part of the Rust compiler and replacing the Rust Analyzer is not as straightforward and requires ongoing maintenance. They point to C# Roslyn and TypeScript as examples of languages with built-in mindsets for this.

User "cycm" shares their interest in analyzing and transforming trees, mentioning that they have been reading and increasing their belief in XSLT for searching, tree walking, and analyzing transformations. Another user, "hds," recommends functional XSLT as a practical approach.

The discussion covers various aspects of language server development, including the challenges of semantic analysis, IDE friendliness, tooling support, and the trade-offs involved in analyzing and transforming different programming languages.

### Things are about to get worse for generative AI

#### [Submission URL](https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/things-are-about-to-get-a-lot-worse) | 383 points | by [eddyzh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eddyzh) | [722 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38814093)

In a recent article, AI scientist Gary Marcus discusses the potential challenges and legal implications for generative AI systems like OpenAI's DALL-E and ChatGPT. Marcus highlights that these systems have the capability to reproduce text and images verbatim, which could lead to copyright infringement issues. He mentions experiments conducted with film industry concept artist Reid Southen, where they discovered that OpenAI's image software, accessed through Bing, can also replicate sources nearly verbatim. Marcus points out that the current safeguards in place to prevent infringement, such as blocking proper names, are not entirely reliable. Even without mentioning specific characters or films, generative AI systems can still potentially produce infringing material. Marcus states that these systems lack transparency and do not provide information about the provenance of the images they produce. He suggests that unless a new architecture can reliably track the origin of generative text and images, infringement will continue to be a problem. Marcus predicts that the New York Times lawsuit against OpenAI may be just the first of many legal challenges. He also notes that Microsoft, as the provider of Bing used in the experiments, could also be implicated. The full report on these experiments will be published on January 3 on IEEE Spectrum.

The discussion around the submission revolves around several different points. 

One user argues that copyright should not be the main focus of the AI and legal discussions, as there is a broader issue of collective storytelling and reinterpretation of shared cultural narratives. They believe that AI-generated content should be seen as a form of common property involving the evolution of storytelling. 

Another user points out that the discussion overlooks the difference between copyrighting exact works versus characters or storylines. They argue that removing literal copyright terms would allow people to freely make their own interpretations of existing works without infringing copyright. 

There is also a discussion about George Lucas and his handling of merchandising rights for Star Wars. One user provides a quote from an article about Lucas's significant business decision to retain merchandising rights instead of giving them to the studio, which allowed him to generate additional revenue. 

Some users question whether copyright actually stops people from making billions through merchandising, citing examples of unauthorized Star Wars merchandise and homemade drawings of popular characters like Mario. They argue that copyright protects larger companies like Disney but disadvantages smaller creators. 

One user brings up the issue of centralized control by companies like Disney, stating that their extensive marketing of copyrighted content corners the market and hampers competition. 

There is also a discussion about the distinction between creating original artwork of characters like Mario versus reproducing copyrighted materials word-for-word. Some users argue that AI should not be allowed to commercially create copyrighted content, while others mention the costs involved in licensing images and the benefit of access to large libraries of copyrighted materials for creators. 

One user accuses OpenAI of profiting by providing the ability to generate copyrighted images, while another user sarcastically claims that OpenAI is profiting $20 million by drawing Mario pictures and reproducing NYT articles word-for-word. 

Overall, the discussion touches on various aspects of copyright, the rights of creators, the role of AI, and the implications for content generation and ownership in the digital age.

### Driverless cars immune from traffic tickets in California under current laws

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/can-driverless-cars-get-tickets-california-law-rcna131538) | 95 points | by [ceejayoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ceejayoz) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38815531)

The rapid expansion of self-driving cars in California has raised concerns about the need for new laws and regulations to govern the technology. There are ongoing safety concerns and uncertainties about law enforcement's ability to cite autonomous vehicles when they violate traffic laws. While driverless cars have been involved in incidents such as running red lights and blocking emergency responders, there is currently little that law enforcement can do to penalize these violations. Traffic tickets can only be issued if there is an actual driver in the car. The lack of accountability has led some to question whether it's a level playing field and whether fairness is a priority. California's current legal framework does not encompass driverless vehicles and new laws are needed to govern the technology adequately. In contrast to California, Texas and Arizona have adapted their transportation laws to allow the ticketing of driverless cars. Despite the limitations, autonomous vehicle makers claim their technology is getting better and that their cars are already safer than human drivers. However, with the technology still in its early stages and much testing happening on city streets alongside human drivers and pedestrians, there are concerns about the unknown risks and the lack of consent for these experiments.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the need for regulations and liability in the context of self-driving cars. Some users point out that in Texas, autonomous vehicles can be ticketed for traffic violations regardless of whether there is a person present in the vehicle, while California's legal framework does not cover driverless vehicles. Others argue that individual owners of self-driving cars should be responsible for any violations, while some suggest that open-source software could bypass regulatory controls. There is also discussion about the potential market for self-driving cars and the challenges of regulatory compliance. Overall, the conversation showcases differing opinions on the responsibility and accountability for self-driving cars.

Researchers at Stanford University have developed an AI tool called PIGEON (Predicting Image Geolocations) that can accurately guess the location where a photo was taken. The system, which was trained using images from Google Street View, can identify the correct country 95% of the time and pinpoint the location within about 25 miles. While the technology has potential applications in fields such as biology and cultural heritage, privacy experts are concerned that it could be used for government surveillance, corporate tracking, or stalking. The PIGEON algorithm recently outperformed a human expert in a geolocation contest.

The discussion around the submission consists of several different topics:

1. Some users are surprised that the PIGEON tool is able to accurately geolocate photos using limited resources. One user mentioned that a YouTuber attempted to replicate the results and found them to be surprisingly accurate, even locating a random photo taken of a replanted tree outside a window.

2. Another user brings up Google's location statement AI and wonders if the technology could be applied to photos that are shared online.

3. A user mentions that changing camera settings on Android devices can enable location metadata to be included in photos.

4. Another user shares a link to an article about Google's dumbing down of geolocation in photos.

5. One user challenges a user named Bard who claimed to have given hints about their location, specifically in Switzerland. The challenge suggests that Bard is being cryptic without providing any concrete information.

6. There is a brief mention of Rainbolt, though it is not clear what this refers to.

7. A discussion ensues about using the iPhone Photos app to add location metadata to photos. One user mentions a feature in the app that adds location metadata automatically.

8. Some users discuss the need for a more sophisticated search method to find landmarks in photos and mention an AI model called Visual Lookup.

9. One user mentions that Stanford graduate students have written a paper about the PIGEON tool but have not made the full model publicly available, which raises concerns about its potential implications.
