#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00927) | 131 points | by [fzliu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fzliu) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43562384)

In a fascinating update for those following advancements in language model technology, a new paper has been submitted to arXiv by Olga Golovneva and her team titled "Multi-Token Attention." This paper is shaking up the traditional soft attention mechanism used by large language models (LLMs). Traditionally, attention weights rely on the similarity between individual query and key token vectors, potentially limiting the information that can be harnessed. However, the authors introduce an innovative approach called Multi-Token Attention (MTA), which allows attention weights to be influenced by multiple query and key vectors at once. This novel method leverages convolution operations to help nearby queries and keys impact each other's attention weights. As a result, MTA can utilize richer and more nuanced information, making it particularly adept at handling complex language modeling tasks and searching through lengthy contexts. The initial evaluations reveal that MTA outperforms standard Transformer models in various benchmarks, showcasing its potential as a more precise and powerful tool for language processing. Keep an eye on this development‚Äîit could be a game-changer in the computation and language research landscape!

Issues like numerical instability, correctness errors, and performance drops compared to optimized libraries like Flash Attention were raised.

2. **Comparisons to Existing Methods**:
   - **RoPE and Chunking**: Some argued that positional encoding techniques like RoPE (used in LLaMA) or hierarchical chunking (e.g., splitting text into logical segments for local attention) might be more efficient for handling long contexts than overhauling attention mechanisms outright.
   - **Hybrid Architectures**: Users shared positive results from combining CNNs/GRUs with Transformers for stability and performance, suggesting MTA could learn from hybrid approaches. Others referenced "convolution comeback" models like Hyena, which blend convolutional operations with attention.

3. **Computational Trade-offs**: Critics questioned whether the complexity of MTA justifies its marginal gains, especially given increased computational costs. The discussion emphasized balancing performance improvements with real-world constraints, like inference speed and memory bandwidth.

4. **Context-Length Challenges**: While MTA aims to handle long contexts, users debated whether local attention windows or hierarchical methods (e.g., Longformer) are sufficient. Some viewed MTA's focus on nearby tokens as a potential step backward compared to Transformers' global attention.

5. **Tokenization Debates**: A tangent emerged on moving beyond subword tokenization (e.g., BPE) to byte-level models (like Byte Latent Transformer). Critics argued LLMs are fundamentally tied to tokenization, while optimists pointed to byte-level approaches as more flexible alternatives.

6. **Broader Architectural Trends**: Participants highlighted evolving trends in efficient attention (e.g., Flash Attention, RetNet, Mamba) and the importance of optimizing existing methods rather than reinventing the wheel.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects cautious optimism about MTA‚Äôs conceptual innovation but underscores practical hurdles. Many users advocated for incremental improvements or hybrid architectures over radical changes, emphasizing the need for stability, efficiency, and compatibility with existing optimizations.

### What, exactly, is an 'AI Agent'? Here's a litmus test

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tines.com/blog/a-litmus-test-for-ai-agents/) | 90 points | by [1as](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=1as) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43560849)

In the quest to clearly define what constitutes an "AI agent," a spirited discussion often emerges. The term generally refers to AI-driven systems possessing autonomy, reasoning, and tool-using capabilities. Yet, there's an apparent paradox: widely used systems like ChatGPT fit this bill, but are not often labeled as agents by creators such as OpenAI or the tech community. This reflects a nebulous vibe of ‚Äúwe‚Äôll know it when we see it.‚Äù

Seeking clarity, Tines devised a concrete definition with inspiration from legal concepts of agency. Central to this definition is the notion of "identity." Just as in law‚Äîwhere an agent can act both on behalf of a principal and independently‚Äîa true AI agent is a system taking actions under its own identity. This independence shows up in audit logs naming the agent directly.

The litmus test for determining a genuine AI agent rests on the system‚Äôs ability to operate autonomously, engage in reasoning, and take responsibility for its actions. Unlike AI assistants, which function under human supervision and control, a bona fide agent acts on behalf of an organization under its own identity.

Applying this differentiation helps categorize tools like Tines's Workbench as non-agents, emphasizing their essential function as effective human collaborators. Meanwhile, true AI agents hold the promise of independently pushing the boundaries of action and decision-making in organizations. Tines eagerly anticipates the evolution and greater deployment of such systems, foreseeing transformative shifts in how AI operates alongside us.

The Hacker News discussion on defining "AI agents" revolved around several key themes, reflecting both alignment with and skepticism toward Tines' identity-based definition:

### **1. Core Debate: What Constitutes an "Agent"?**
- **Identity vs. Autonomy**: While Tines' legal-inspired definition (an AI acting under its own identity in audit logs) resonated with some, others argued that **autonomy** and **feedback loops** are more critical. For instance, users debated whether ChatGPT plugins (e.g., Code Interpreter) qualify as agents if they execute code independently but lack persistent identity.
- **Workflows vs. Agents**: Many comments distinguished between predefined workflows (e.g., LangChain scripts) and true agents. Workflows follow deterministic paths, while agents dynamically adapt‚Äîthough some users noted that modern systems blend both (e.g., Temporal workflows with LLM flexibility).

### **2. Limitations of Current LLMs**
- Participants highlighted that today‚Äôs LLMs often lack **reliable reasoning** and **planning capabilities**, making them unsuitable for complex agentic tasks. Examples included hallucinations, rigid outputs, and the need for human supervision in tools like IFTTT/Zapier automations.

### **3. Practical Concerns and Examples**
- **Gray Areas**: Users pointed out edge cases, like whether an AI scheduling movie tickets via a calendar API constitutes an agent, or if long-running marketing bots qualify. The line between ‚Äútool‚Äù and ‚Äúagent‚Äù remains blurry.
- **Real-World Systems**: Code Interpreter was cited as a near-agent for its ability to execute code and react to outputs, while critics noted its confined scope. Some argued that even simple feedback loops (e.g., retrying failed API calls) inch systems toward agency.

### **4. Skepticism Over Definitions**
- Several users dismissed rigid definitions, arguing that **functionality matters more than labels**. For example, *jnlsncm* criticized semantic debates, emphasizing reliability over terminology, while others compared the debate to past AGI discussions.

### **5. Broader Implications**
- Terminology‚Äôs Impact: A subset stressed that clear definitions aid design and communication. *swyx* noted that good mental models lead to better tools, even if classifications are imperfect.
- Cultural Divide: The discussion mirrored broader industry tensions‚Äîbetween marketing buzzwords (‚ÄúAI agent‚Äù) and technical precision, and between academic definitions and real-world implementations.

### **Conclusion**
The discussion underscored that while Tines' identity-based definition offers clarity, the community remains divided. Most agree that true agents require autonomy, reasoning, and accountability‚Äîbut where to draw the line (e.g., identity vs. action impact) is unresolved. As LLMs evolve, the boundary between ‚Äúadvanced tool‚Äù and ‚Äúagent‚Äù will likely keep shifting.

The discussion on Nolan Lawson's evolving views on generative AI reflects a mix of skepticism, curiosity, and introspection about AI's role in coding and creativity:  

1. **Skepticism and Adaptation**:  
   - Some users humorously questioned AI's reliability (e.g., arithmetic errors in JavaScript), while others acknowledged its efficiency gains (e.g., automating repetitive tasks like FTP workflows). A subthread debated whether AI tools genuinely improve productivity or risk diluting foundational coding skills.  

2. **Human Creativity vs. AI**:  
   - Commenters likened generative AI to a "derivative" force, echoing McLuhan‚Äôs idea of technology as an extension of humanity. While AI can assist with technical challenges (e.g., TypeScript generics), many argued that human creativity‚Äîarchitecting solutions, optimizing systems, and the "joy" of problem-solving‚Äîremains irreplaceable.  

3. **Nostalgia and Critique**:  
   - Lawson‚Äôs candid reflection resonated as a "deeply human" take in a tech landscape often dominated by hype. Some lamented the encroachment of AI on craftsmanship, comparing it to "1000 monkeys typing on typewriters," while others appreciated his balanced perspective.  

4. **AI Methodology Shifts**:  
   - A reinforcement learning (RL) advocate highlighted RL‚Äôs resurgence as a framework for generalizable intelligence, celebrating its potential after years of being overshadowed by narrow approaches.  

**Key Takeaway**: The thread underscores a tension between embracing AI's practical benefits and preserving the irreplicable spark of human ingenuity. As one user put it, even amid AI‚Äôs rise, the thrill of "architecting a solution" or "debugging a gnarly problem" remains uniquely fulfilling.

### Real-Time Introspective Compression for Transformers

Hey there, tech enthusiasts! Today's top story on Hacker News dives into a fascinating new approach for transformer models, specifically tackling the notorious challenges of introspection and the ephemerality of cognition. Transformers, like those powering GPT-3, process massive amounts of data but struggle with self-monitoring and dynamically revisiting internal states due to their fleeting nature.

Enter "Real-Time Introspective Compression for Transformers," a brainchild of Jeffrey Emanuel and his innovative squad. The crux of this method is likening a transformer's thought process to the save states in video games. Instead of saving every exhaustive detail (akin to every frame of gameplay), this technique aims to compactly archive crucial "game states" (or model states) to enable precise replay and introspection. 

The magic? This is achieved through a sidecar transformer model, which encodes and decodes latent representations of these states on a theoretical lower-dimensional manifold, conserving space while retaining fidelity. This could revolutionize how we debug, enhance interpretability, and refine the capabilities of AI systems. Not only does this promise to shed light on the mystery box nature of transformers, but it also opens new doors for AI efficiency with its smart compression techniques. Ready your bookmarks; this one's a keeper!

However, concerns were raised about **fidelity loss** and the **computational overhead** of maintaining compressed latent states. Some questioned whether the added space requirements might offset efficiency gains.

2. **Comparisons to Existing Models**  
   - A user asked if the approach essentially recreates **recurrent neural networks (RNNs)**. The response clarified that transformers process sequences non-recurrently, and the sidecar model‚Äôs role is to encode latent states for retrospection without altering the transformer‚Äôs core architecture.

3. **Future Scalability**  
   - Skeptics joked about computational costs (e.g., "April Fools prank"), but others countered that hardware advancements (e.g., smaller, more capable models like 30B-parameter systems) could make the method practical within 4‚Äì5 years. Debates touched on **thermodynamic limits** of computing power as a potential roadblock.

4. **Strategic Abstraction & Learning**  
   - The idea of "strategy distillation" (extracting higher-level reasoning patterns) sparked discussion about how gradient updates could transfer latent reasoning strategies across tasks, enabling more dynamic learning akin to **reinforcement learning agents**.

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - The method was framed as a step toward transformers evolving from "stateless text generators" into **reflective cognitive systems** capable of self-improvement. Users highlighted potential for debugging, exploring alternative decision paths, and even meta-learning ("learning to learn").

### Notable Quotes:
- *"Transformers today discard internal states... [This] reloads saved 'game states' for LLMs."*  
- *"It‚Äôs fundamentally moving AI from generating text to thinking."*  
- *"Compute power is increasing... highly relevant in 4‚Äì5 years."*

### Conclusion:
