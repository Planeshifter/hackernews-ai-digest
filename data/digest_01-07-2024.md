#### [Submission URL](https://zserge.com/posts/ai-eliza/) | 116 points | by [john-doe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=john-doe) | [101 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38900304)

In the year 2023, AI became a hot topic in the media, sparking debates about its potential and progress. But the fascination with non-human intelligence goes way back, with dreams of simulating human intelligence dating back to ancient times. The Turing test, introduced in the 1950s, became a benchmark for determining whether AI could truly be considered intelligent. One of the earliest AI programs to pass this test was Eliza, created in 1966 by Joseph Weizenbaum. Eliza emulated the speech patterns of a psychotherapist and still outperforms some modern AI programs. Today, we'll recreate Eliza's basic chatbot functionality using Go code. By implanting knowledge in the form of structured keywords and transformation rules, Eliza can engage in more sophisticated conversations. Synonym groups help with reducing rule duplication and create more natural responses. With some additional preprocessing and postprocessing rules, Eliza can provide a more intelligent and human-like interaction. Stay tuned for more updates on AI progress!

The discussion begins with a comment from user "jll29" linking an academic paper about Joseph Weizenbaum and his AI program Eliza. The paper discusses Weizenbaum's views on AI and how Eliza passed the Turing test. User "dstfn" adds that Weizenbaum wrote a book called "Computer Power and Human Reason" which explores the relationship between humans and machines. Another user, "stvrs," expresses confusion about how computers make decisions. User "aatd86" responds by saying that choice is determined by mechanism and provides an example involving quantum mechanics. User "vdrh" argues that choice is not determined by mechanisms and mentions compatibilist views on free will. The discussion then veers into a debate about determinism, complexity, and the nature of human judgment. Users "jhnnywrkr" and "vdrh" have an extensive conversation about the compatibility of human judgment with computation, with "jhnnywrkr" arguing that judgment is non-computable due to non-mathematical factors. User "xtrctnmch" chimes in at the end to reference Joseph Agassi's critical take on Weizenbaum's work.
