**Introducing the Model Context Protocol: A New Standard for AI Connectivity**

In a significant step towards enriching AI capabilities, a new open-source initiative, the Model Context Protocol (MCP), has been announced. Launched on November 25, 2024, MCP aims to bridge the gap between AI assistants and the disparate data sources they rely on, such as content repositories and business tools. 

With the rapid evolution of AI technologies, there has been a persistent challenge: AI models often find themselves isolated from essential data due to cumbersome integrations and legacy systems. The MCP addresses this by offering a universal protocol that simplifies how AI services interact with various data sources, ultimately enhancing the quality and relevancy of their responses.

The MCP framework consists of three key components that developers can start using immediately:
1. The Model Context Protocol specification and SDKs.
2. Local MCP server support in the Claude Desktop applications.

### Computing with Time: Microarchitectural Weird Machines

#### [Submission URL](https://cacm.acm.org/research-highlights/computing-with-time-microarchitectural-weird-machines/) | 125 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235418)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers introduce the concept of microarchitectural weird machines (µWMs), which leverage the intricate behaviors of modern CPUs to craft a novel form of computation powered by side effects from microarchitectural components like branch predictors and caches. This approach opens the door to a unique obfuscation technique that allows malware to stealthily execute harmful actions while remaining invisible to conventional detection methods. Notably, the researchers demonstrate a µWM cleverly disguising malware that remains dormant until it receives a specific trigger, at which point it decrypts and executes a payload.

The paper also details the construction of these µWMs, which consist of weird registers (WRs), weird gates (WGs), and weird circuits (WCs), showcasing their ability to perform complex computations such as generating SHA-1 hashes. This innovative framework represents a potential game-changer in program obfuscation, as existing security tools typically overlook the underlying microarchitectural interactions, making µWMs resistant to traditional analysis techniques. As side-channel attacks become more prevalent, this research raises intriguing implications for the future of security and malware development in computing systems.

The discussion on the submission about microarchitectural weird machines (µWMs) contains several key points raised by users:

1. **Comparison to Other Attacks**: Users drew parallels between µWMs and known attack methods such as SQL injection and the ways they exploit system vulnerabilities. This includes an analogy to how SQL injection can manipulate execution flow by using techniques like sleep delays.
