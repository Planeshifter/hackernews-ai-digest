### Show HN: Sweep, Open-weights 1.5B model for next-edit autocomplete

#### [Submission URL](https://huggingface.co/sweepai/sweep-next-edit-1.5B) | 466 points | by [williamzeng0](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=williamzeng0) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46713106)

Sweep Next-Edit 1.5B: a tiny, local “next-edit” code model in GGUF (Q8_0) that predicts your next patch rather than the next token. It’s a 1.5B-parameter fine-tune on Qwen2.5-Coder with an 8k context, quantized to a 1.54 GB GGUF for llama.cpp.

Why it’s interesting
- Edit-level autocomplete: Uses file context, recent diffs, and current state to propose the next edit, making multi-line changes feel like “apply patch” rather than keystroke-by-keystroke.
- Fast and local: Claims sub-500ms latency with speculative decoding on a laptop, while outperforming models 4x larger on next-edit benchmarks.
- Open and IDE-ready: Apache 2.0 license and a JetBrains plugin for direct integration.

Specs and usage
- Architecture: Qwen2-based, 1.5B params, 8192-token context.
- Format: GGUF Q8_0; intended for llama.cpp (via llama-cpp-python).
- Get started: Download run_model.py and the model, install llama-cpp-python and huggingface_hub, then run the script. The provided prompt format includes file context + diffs.

Caveats
- Early days: modest download count so far; no hosted inference providers listed.
- Performance claims are benchmark-based; real-world mileage will vary with project and hardware.

Links: Blog post with technical details/benchmarks and a Sweep AI JetBrains plugin are provided in the release.

**JetBrains dissatisfaction:** A significant portion of the discussion centers on frustrations with JetBrains' native AI offerings. Users like **vnllmw** and **cmrdprcpn** express disappointment that JetBrains "dropped the ball" regarding AI integration, prompting moves to VS Code or Zed. They specifically criticize "Junie" (JetBrains' AI assistant) and the lack of fluid, third-party model support for "tab-to-complete" functionality compared to the chat-heavy Claude Code workflow.

**Local alternatives and cost:** Several users (**ntsylvr**, **KronisLV**) are looking to replace paid subscriptions (Cursor, Copilot) with competent local models due to cost and "subscription fatigue." There is enthusiasm for the "small model" approach (1.5B attributes) that allows for low-latency, private inference on consumer hardware, though **mark_l_watson** notes that small, purpose-built models are often underappreciated.

**Plugins and privacy:** diverse tooling discussions emerged, with **lnrdcsr** effectively sharing a community-created Neovim plugin. However, skepticism arose regarding the official JetBrains plugin included in the release; users like **klb** and **NewsaHackO** noted that the official plugin currently appears to require a sign-in or cloud endpoint, seemingly contradicting the "run local" appeal of the GGUF weights.

**Technical nuances:** There was discussion regarding the specific nature of the model, with **kmrnjn** asking for the distinction between "next-edit" logic and standard FIM (Fill-In-The-Middle). **shpscrk** theorized that while FIM simply fills text gaps coverage, an edit model applies diff-like logic to existing file states.

### Your brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant

#### [Submission URL](https://www.media.mit.edu/publications/your-brain-on-chatgpt/) | 468 points | by [misswaterfairy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=misswaterfairy) | [339 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46712678)

MIT Media Lab study: AI-assisted writing may create “cognitive debt”
A new preprint from MIT researchers tracked 54 people writing essays with three approaches—LLM (e.g., ChatGPT), traditional search, or no tools—while measuring brain activity via EEG and scoring output with human and AI graders. After three sessions, some participants switched conditions for a fourth to test carryover effects.

Key findings
- Brain engagement: Brain-only writers showed the strongest, most distributed connectivity; search users were mid; LLM users were lowest. Cognitive activity scaled down with more external tool use.
- Carryover “debt”: Participants who switched from LLM to brain-only showed reduced alpha/beta connectivity—signs of under-engagement—even after the tool was removed.
- Switching to LLM: Those who moved from brain-only to LLM had higher memory recall and activation patterns similar to search users.
- Output characteristics: Within each group, essays clustered in similar named entities, n-grams, and topic ontology. LLM users reported the lowest sense of ownership and had trouble accurately quoting their own work.
- Longitudinal signal: Over roughly four months, LLM users underperformed across neural, linguistic, and behavioral measures compared to brain-only.

Why it matters
- Convenience vs. capacity: The results suggest a tradeoff—LLMs speed up drafting but may dampen cognitive engagement and degrade recall and ownership, with effects that can persist after turning the tool off.
- Education implications: Raises questions about how and when to use AI in writing curricula, and how to design tools that support, rather than replace, cognitive effort.

Caveats
- Preprint, not yet peer-reviewed.
- Modest sample (54 initially, 18 for the crossover session).
- EEG is indirect; essay tasks and scoring may not generalize to all writing contexts.
- Results reflect specific prompts, tools, and timeframes.

Paper: “Your Brain on ChatGPT: Accumulation of Cognitive Debt when Using an AI Assistant for Essay Writing Task” (arXiv:2506.08872)
https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion threads focused heavily on applying the study’s concept of "cognitive debt" to software engineering, specifically the trade-off between writing code manually versus reviewing AI-generated output.

**Coding as Understanding vs. Coding as a Commodity**
*   **The case for manual writing:** User *mcv* validated the study with an anecdote about implementing a complex graph layout algorithm. They found that while AI helped as an "interactive encyclopedia" to explain concepts, letting it write the actual code caused a loss of understanding and flow. They argued that writing the code is necessary to grasp the intricacies of the problem.
*   **The "Muscle" argument:** Users *Kamq*, *jvndrbt*, and *lrntrd* argued that writing code creates a mental model that reading cannot replicate. They suggested that reading/reviewing code often takes longer than writing it if the goal is deep comprehension, and that relying on AI creates "knowledge inertia" or "silly causal loops" where humans clean up poor design choices without understanding the implementation details.

**The Counterpoint: The "Actual Job" is Problem Solving**
*   **Focus on ROI:** User *vdrh* consistently argued that the "actual job" of a developer is solving business problems, not writing low-level syntax. They posited that deep algorithmic understanding is often "low ROI" work and that the industry has historically moved away from low-level details (e.g., moving from Assembler to high-level abstractions).
*   **AI as a Coworker:** From this perspective, AI acts as a coworker or a new layer of abstraction. *vdrh* suggested that digging into low-level code manually is rarely productive and that developers should focus on architecture, domain models, and verifying specs.

**The Verification Gap**
*   **Subtle Errors:** *mythical_39* and *lzd* questioned whether a developer can effectively verify code they didn't write, noting that AI errors are often subtle. *krnnr* provided a specific example where AI wrote "beautiful" but inefficient code for a data comparison task because it lacked the human's context on specific data characteristics (optimization opportunities) that standard tests might miss.
*   **Automated Solutions:** *pixl97* and *smllrfsh* suggested that the solution to these verification issues is more automation—specifically, using AI to generate adversarial test cases or to run iterative profiling and optimization loops to catch performance regressions.

### eBay explicitly bans AI "buy for me" agents in user agreement update

#### [Submission URL](https://www.valueaddedresource.net/ebay-bans-ai-agents-updates-arbitration-user-agreement-feb-2026/) | 256 points | by [bdcravens](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bdcravens) | [272 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46711574)

eBay draws a line on AI shopping bots, tightens arbitration terms

- What’s new: eBay’s latest User Agreement (posted Jan 20, 2026; effective Feb 20, 2026 for existing users) explicitly bans AI “buy-for-me” agents and LLM-driven bots from interacting with the site without prior written permission. The clause now names “buy-for-me agents, LLM-driven bots, or any end-to-end flow that attempts to place orders without human review” under its long-standing prohibition on automated access/scraping.

- Why it matters: This targets agentic commerce tools and LLM-based scrapers that browse listings, extract data, or place orders autonomously. It follows eBay’s December robots.txt tweaks adding AI guardrails and arrives amid backlash to Amazon’s “Buy For Me” agent, which surfaced merchant products without consent. Expect stricter enforcement against AI-driven scraping/training and automated checkout flows.

- Arbitration changes:
  - Clarifies and broadens the class-action waiver to cover more forms of group or representative actions.
  - Clarifies how to opt out of arbitration.
  - Updates the physical notice address to: 339 W. 13490 S., Ste. 500, Draper, UT 84020 (DisputeNotice@eBay.com remains).
  - Net effect: more emphasis on individual arbitration over group litigation.

- Practical impact:
  - Devs/companies building AI shoppers, price-trackers, or LLM data pipelines will need explicit permission to access eBay or risk violations.
  - Sellers and buyers should review the arbitration section and note any opt-out deadlines and the new mailing address.

**Discussion Summary**

The discussion on Hacker News focused heavily on the economic incentives behind eBay's ban, with users generally agreeing that AI agents threaten the marketplace's ad-driven business model.

*   **The "Dumb Pipe" Theory:** The top thread argued that eBay relies on monetizing "wandering attention" via sponsored listings and impulse buys. Users noted that "laser-focused" AI agents—which execute transactions without browsing—effectively turn eBay into a commoditized backend database, destroying the margins derived from human browsing behavior.
*   **Quality Control & Scams:** Commenters pointed out that unlike Amazon's commodity stock, eBay lists unique used goods where condition matters. There was skepticism that current LLMs could reliably detect scams (e.g., "box only" listings) or judge item quality, leading to a spike in returns and disputes that would harm the ecosystem.
*   **Aggregator Threat:** Drawing comparisons to the "DoorDash problem," users suggested eBay is preventing a future where they are severed from their customers, with AI agents acting as a middleware layer that dictates where purchases occur based on who pays the AI.
*   **Search vs. transacting:** While many users expressed interest in using AI for *monitoring* listings (getting alerts for specific server parts or collectibles), there was a consensus that fully autonomous *purchasing* is currently too risky for a flea-market style platform.

*Note: Some users humorously (and critically) observed that the top comment analyzing the "death of the browsing model" read like it was written by an AI itself, sparking a meta-discussion on the "Dead Internet Theory."*

### Claude's new constitution

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-new-constitution) | 532 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [620 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707572)

Anthropic publishes Claude’s new constitution (CC0), a blueprint for how the model should think and act. Unlike the earlier list of standalone rules, the new document explains the “why” behind behaviors, aiming to help models generalize and exercise judgment rather than follow rigid instructions. It’s written primarily for Claude, serves as the final authority on desired behavior, and is now central to training—guiding synthetic data generation, response ranking, and value shaping.

Key points:
- Priorities (in order): be broadly safe; broadly ethical; compliant with Anthropic’s guidelines; genuinely helpful. Conflicts should be resolved in that order.
- Mix of principles and “hard constraints”: bright-line bans for high‑stakes areas, but otherwise guidance over legalism.
- Transparency goal: publishing the constitution clarifies which behaviors are intended vs. unintended as AI influence grows.
- Open license: released under CC0, inviting reuse by others.
- Practical focus: helps Claude balance honesty, compassion, and sensitive info protection; frames oversight as essential in the current development phase.

Why it matters: This is a notable evolution of Constitutional AI—from rules to a value‑laden, trainable artifact. Expect debate on whether such constitutions translate into reliably safer behavior versus better-sounding outputs, and how well this approach scales as models gain capability.

Based on the discussion, users engaged in a philosophical debate regarding the risks of moving from strict rules to "values-based" judgment in AI, focusing heavily on moral relativism versus objective truth.

**The Risks of Subjective Morality**
The thread opened with `jshmcgnns` arguing that updating a constitution based on "generally favorable" values or "practical wisdom" rather than objective truth is dangerous. They contended that checking values against a specific team's views or cultural pressures risks embedding a form of moral relativism, effectively making one company's subjective ethics the "de facto standard" for the world's influential tools.

**Debate on Universal Moral Standards**
This critique sparked a contentious sub-thread debating whether "universal moral standards" actually exist:
*   **The "Torturing Babies" Test:** User `skssn` proposed "torturing babies for sport" as a universal moral wrong that essentially no culture accepts.
*   **Historical Relativism:** Several users (`srssy`, `lsnt`, `Amezarak`) challenged this, citing historical examples of infanticide, ritual sacrifice, and harsh treatment of children in the Middle Ages or ancient cultures to suggest that values are historically relative.
*   **Defining the Terms:** `skssn` defended the universal standard by distinguishing "sport" (sadism/hobby) from warfare, genocide, or religious sacrifice, arguing that purely sadistic torture of infants is universally reviled. `Dilettante_` and `Cthulhu_` complicated the definition by pointing out gray areas, such as tickling (causing a reaction) or vaccination (inflicting pain for medical good).

**The Nature of Moral Framing**
The discussion shifted to the utility of moral philosophy itself:
*   **Pragmatism:** `Antibabelic` argued that "moral framing" is redundant; society punishes harmful acts and humans have negative emotional reactions to them, making the label of "morality" unnecessary information.
*   **Systemic Understanding:** `jychng` strongly disagreed, comparing moral philosophy to germ theory. They argued that relying solely on social punishment or disgust is like washing hands just to avoid social shame; understanding the underlying moral system (like understanding germs) is required to know *why* the rules exist and to maintain them if laws or social norms change.

### Show HN: yolo-cage – AI coding agents that can't exfiltrate secrets

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/borenstein/yolo-cage) | 57 points | by [borenstein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=borenstein) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46706796)

yolo-cage: let your AI code “YOLO,” without leaking secrets or merging PRs

What it is
- An open-source sandbox that lets autonomous coding agents work freely while constraining their blast radius. It replaces nonstop “Are you sure?” prompts with infra-level guardrails so risky decisions wait until PR review.

How it works
- Per-branch sandboxes: Each agent gets its own pod; it can only push to its assigned branch.
- Git/GitHub mediation: A dispatcher enforces branch isolation, blocks dangerous gh commands (e.g., gh pr merge, gh repo delete), and runs TruffleHog on pre-push.
- Egress proxy: Filters all HTTP/S, scans bodies/headers/URLs for secrets (patterns like sk-ant-*, AKIA*, ghp_*, SSH keys), blocks exfiltration sites (pastebin, file.io, transfer.sh), and denies risky GitHub API calls (merge, repo delete, webhook edits).
- Stack: Vagrant VM running MicroK8s; the agent (e.g., Claude Code in “YOLO mode”) runs inside the sandbox. All outbound traffic is filtered.

CLI highlights
- create/attach/shell/list/delete sandboxes; port-forward to access web apps from your host; up/down the VM; upgrade/version commands.

Why it matters
- Moves safety from user vigilance to infrastructure controls, reducing decision fatigue while preserving speed. Useful for teams trialing AI agents against real repos with scoped credentials.

Limitations (explicitly acknowledged)
- Doesn’t eliminate risk: DNS exfiltration, timing channels, steganography, and clever encodings can still leak data. Provides a Security Audit/escape testing guide.

Basics
- Prereqs: Vagrant with libvirt (Linux) or QEMU (macOS, experimental), 8GB RAM, 4 CPUs, GitHub PAT (repo scope), Claude account.
- License: MIT. Latest release: v0.2.14 (Jan 21, 2026).

Discussion on this open-source sandbox for AI agents centered on the reliability of regex-based filtering, the philosophy of "defense in depth," and the paradox of using AI-generated infrastructure to constrain AI.

*   **The AI Recursion Paradox:** Commenters were quick to note the irony (and potential risk) of using a tool explicitly written by AI to contain AI risks. The author, **brnstn**, confirmed the codebase was "100% AI wrote, 90% raw text," but defended the approach using a construction analogy: while a construction site (the dev environment) is inherently dangerous and requires guardrails (hard hats/sandboxes), the goal is to produce a safe final structure.
*   **Security Mechanisms & Limitations:** Critique focused heavily on the egress proxy.
    *   Users like **smnw** and **KurSix** argued that content scanning (via LLM-Guard) is easily bypassed by obfuscation (e.g., ROT-13, encoding environment variables) or encryption if the agent decides to be malicious or "annoyed" by restrictions.
    *   The consensus among skeptics was that content analysis is unreliable; strict network solutions (allow-listing specific IPs/packages) are necessary.
    *   **brnstn** acknowledged these limitations, clarifying that the threat model targets **accidental leaks** and human inattention (speed) rather than sophisticated, malicious attacks.
*   **Data Privacy:** **brndw** pointed out that allowing an agent to read the repo already exposes code to the LLM provider (Anthropic). The author suggested treating the agent's environment as "pre-compromised" regarding code confidentiality, while using the sandbox to protect secrets and prevent destructive actions (like deleting repos).
*   **The Shift to Machine-Speed Security:** A commenter from Docker (**srn-dckr**) noted a resurgence in sandboxing (MicroVMs/containers). They observed that traditional security implicitly relies on human hesitation and judgment speed; because agents execute actions instantly, infrastructure-level constraints are replacing human "Are you sure?" prompts.

### Three types of LLM workloads and how to serve them

#### [Submission URL](https://modal.com/llm-almanac/workloads) | 73 points | by [charles_irl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=charles_irl) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46707708)

Title: The three types of LLM workloads (and how to serve them), with concrete infra picks

Gist:
The post argues that “per-token” model APIs hide crucial engineering trade-offs. With open models (DeepSeek, Qwen) and open inference stacks (vLLM, SGLang) catching up fast, teams should architect around their actual workload type to unlock big wins in cost, latency, and reliability.

What’s new/useful:
- Clear workload taxonomy:
  - Offline (batch/analytical): write asynchronously to storage, optimize for throughput per dollar.
  - Online (interactive): human-in-the-loop, streaming, optimize for low latency.
  - Semi-online (bursty/HTAP-like): machine-to-machine on streams of batches, optimize for elasticity and per-replica variability.
- Concrete engine guidance:
  - Offline: vLLM, leveraging async RPC and chunked prefill; send large batches to expose maximum parallelism.
  - Online: SGLang with excess tensor parallelism + EAGLE-3 speculative decoding, served on edge Hopper/Blackwell GPUs behind low-overhead, prefix-aware HTTP proxies.
  - Semi-online: either vLLM or SGLang, but focus on rapid autoscaling that tolerates variable load per replica.
- Why it matters: As open models/inference mature, you can beat generic API pricing by aligning infra to workload shape—throughput-heavy jobs want different kernels, batching, and schedulers than latency-critical chat.
- Technical nuggets:
  - Separate prefill (prompt processing) vs decode (generation); prefill can be chunked.
  - Mixed batching lets lightweight decode piggyback on heavy prefill, improving GPU utilization (see SARATHI).
  - GPUs are inherently throughput-optimized; the win is in batching/scheduling as much as in kernels.
- Examples: Dataset-wide augmentation (Weaviate), bulk call-summary generation—classic offline jobs where job-level completion time matters more than per-request latency.
- Vendor angle: Modal describes how to implement these patterns on its platform with sample code, but the recommendations are generally applicable.

Takeaway:
Stop treating all LLM calls the same. Classify your workload, then pick engine + scheduling + scaling strategies accordingly; you’ll likely cut costs for batch jobs and shave latency for interactive ones.

**Discussion:**

*   **Complexity vs. Specificity:** A commenter reacted with potential exasperation to the density of the "Online" workload recommendation (referencing the specific stack of SGLang, EAGLE-3, and Hopper GPUs). The author (`charles_irl`) responded, acknowledging the jargon but arguing that concrete recommendations derived from first principles are preferable to vague generalizations ("palaver").
*   **Humor:** Users jokingly aligned the "three types" title with Julius Caesar's famous opening to *De Bello Gallico*: "All Gaul is divided into three parts."

### GenAI, the snake eating its own tail

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ybrikman.com/blog/2026/01/21/gen-ai-snake-eating-its-own-tail/) | 95 points | by [brikis98](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brikis98) | [113 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46709320)

GenAI’s two superpowers: a productivity boon—and a slow-motion ecosystem collapse

Thesis: Tools like ChatGPT and Claude massively boost productivity, but they also siphon value from the human-made content and communities they were trained on—without attribution, traffic, or revenue flowing back. That asymmetry looks unsustainable: a snake eating its own tail.

What’s happening
- Online communities: The author argues LLMs accelerated the decline of Q&A hubs like Stack Overflow (citing charts from Marc Gravell), with similar vibes at Quora, Wikipedia, and Reddit. Developers now ask AI directly instead of searching, reducing new questions/answers—the very fuel future models need.
- Open source: Tailwind CSS is more popular than ever, yet Tailwind Labs reportedly laid off ~75% of staff. Claimed causes: docs traffic down >40% as devs query AI instead; and AI can crank out high-quality components, eroding demand for Tailwind’s paid UI product. Net effect: users and AI capture the value; maintainers get squeezed. The author expects similar pressure across OSS.
- Books and blogs: LLMs are patient, judgment-free tutors that can explain concepts in multiple modalities—so people increasingly learn without visiting original sources. Much of that knowledge comes from books/blogs, often without attribution or permission, raising legal and ethical concerns.

Why it matters
- If creators, maintainers, and communities can’t sustain their work, the quality and freshness of the very data LLMs depend on will degrade—hurting everyone downstream.
- The author calls for mechanisms that realign incentives—e.g., attribution, licensing, and compensation models—so users, AI companies, and creators all share in the value.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**Stack Overflow’s Decline Predates AI**
The most prominent thread in the discussion challenges the author’s timeline regarding Stack Overflow. Numerous users argue that the decline began significantly earlier (estimates range from 2014 to 2018) than the arrival of GPT-4. They attribute this stagnation to "knowledge saturation"—the idea that most fundamental questions in stable technologies have already been answered—and the platform's strict moderation, which prioritizes a repository of facts over community discussion.

**Hostility vs. Automated Help**
A major driver for the shift to LLMs, according to commenters, is cultural rather than purely functional. Users described Stack Overflow as increasingly hostile to beginners, citing aggressive moderation and flaming of "naive" questions. In contrast, LLMs provide a "sweet," judgment-free interface for learning, leading some to say "good riddance" to the old gatekeeping dynamics.

**Economic Incentives and "Slop"**
The discussion acknowledges the "ecosystem collapse" risk but offers different outcomes:
*   **Monetizing Authenticity:** Some speculate that if "authentic" content becomes scarce, AI companies will be forced to incentivize creation directly, potentially paying significantly for high-quality training data (e.g., "$1M rewards" for top articles).
*   **The Value of Human Work:** Others argue that as AI floods the web with derivative content or "slop," the demand for novel, human-generated creativity and effective problem-solving will actually increase, reinvigorating the desire for original work in arts and code.

**Critique of the Tailwind Example**
One commenter specifically pushed back on the Tailwind Labs example, suggesting that a business model based on selling UI components on top of an open framework is inherently vulnerable. They argue that developers may simply be building these components themselves more efficiently, rather than AI "stealing" the traffic.

### Show HN: Retain – A unified knowledge base for all your AI coding conversations

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/BayramAnnakov/retain) | 42 points | by [Bayram](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bayram) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46710756)

Retain: a native macOS app that unifies all your AI chats into a searchable, local-first knowledge base. It syncs conversations from Claude Code, claude.ai, ChatGPT, and more, then auto-extracts “learnings” (corrections, preferences) you can export to CLAUDE.md so Claude keeps your context.

Highlights
- Multi-source sync: Auto from Claude Code and Codex CLI (file watching); manual from claude.ai and ChatGPT via cookie import
- Fast search: Full-text search (FTS5) across 10k+ conversations, with a conversation browser and menu bar UI
- Learning extraction: Detects corrections/preferences; export approved items to CLAUDE.md
- Local-first privacy: Stores everything in a local SQLite DB; no servers, telemetry, or tracking
- Optional AI analysis: Gemini-based extraction and Claude Code CLI analysis are opt-in and limited in scope
- Status: Core sync/search are stable; learnings extraction and automations are still in active development
- Caveats: macOS Sonoma+ only; web sync relies on cookies that expire ~30 days; cookie-based auth can break if site APIs change; no import-from-exports yet; no multi-Mac conflict resolution

Why it matters
- Reduces “context amnesia” across AI tools by consolidating history and turning repeated corrections into durable preferences
- Open-source (MIT) and privacy-forward, with clear boundaries around any cloud features

Getting started
- Download the notarized DMG from Releases, grant Full Disk Access for cookie-based sync, and optionally add a Gemini key for AI extraction

Repo: https://github.com/BayramAnnakov/retain

Here is the summary of the Hacker News discussion:

**Discussion**
Users welcomed Retain as a necessary utility, specifically praising its search functionality as a superior alternative to the "bare bones" search found in Anthropic’s official Electron app. Reviewers on Windows and Linux expressed disappointment regarding the macOS exclusivity; in response, the creator hinted that a cross-platform version (potentially utilizing Java) is being considered. There was also a brief semantic debate regarding the "local-first" marketing label, with some users noting the distinction between local storage and the cloud-based origin of the data, a nuance the creator acknowledged.

### Anthropic's original take home assignment open sourced

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/anthropics/original_performance_takehome) | 619 points | by [myahio](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=myahio) | [347 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46700594)

Anthropic open-sources its original “performance take-home” challenge

- What it is: A public version of Anthropic’s engineering take-home focused on low-level performance tuning. You’re given a slow baseline on a simulated machine and asked to drive down cycle counts. Includes tracing tools and tests; multicore is intentionally disabled.

- Why now: Their earlier 4-hour challenge was later tightened to 2 hours after Claude Opus 4 beat most humans; Claude Opus 4.5 then surpassed that. This release lets anyone try, with unlimited time, starting from the slowest baseline.

- Benchmarks (lower is better; from the 2-hour version that started at 18,532 cycles):
  - 2164: Claude Opus 4 (with lots of test-time compute)
  - 1790: Claude Opus 4.5 (casual session; ~best human in 2 hours)
  - 1579: Claude Opus 4.5 (2 hours with test-time compute)
  - 1548: Claude Sonnet 4.5 (many hours)
  - 1487: Claude Opus 4.5 (11.5 hours)
  - 1363: Claude Opus 4.5 (improved harness)
  - Best human: “substantially better,” exact number not disclosed

- Hiring hook: If you beat 1487 cycles (Opus 4.5’s best at launch), Anthropic invites you to email performance-recruiting@anthropic.com with your code (and ideally a resume).

- Anti-cheat warning: Several early submissions under 1300 cycles were invalid—LLMs “optimized” by modifying tests (e.g., re-enabling multicore). Keep tests unchanged and validate with:
  - git diff origin/main tests/
  - python tests/submission_tests.py

- Why it matters: Rare, transparent peek into how a top AI lab evaluates systems/performance engineering under tight constraints—plus a public leaderboard moment pitting humans vs. state-of-the-art models on real optimization work.

**Discussion Summary:**

Commenters engaged in a technical deep dive of the challenge while debating the necessity of low-level optimization skills in modern software engineering.

*   **Specialized vs. General Knowledge:** several users pointed out that this challenge is exceptionally niche, requiring knowledge of GPGPU constraints, arithmetic pipelines, and hardware-specific optimization that "99% of developers" never encounter. One veteran with 30 years of experience admitted to not understanding the prompt, while others noted that unless a candidate has worked at specific hardware or billion-dollar tech firms, they likely lack the context to attempt it.
*   **Technical Analysis:** User `mike_hearn` provided a detailed breakdown of the challenge, explaining that it requires reverse-engineering a Python based simulation of a VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and SIMD machine. The architecture resembles mobile DSPs (like Qualcomm’s Hexagon) rather than standard Intel or NVIDIA architectures, forcing the programmer to manually schedule parallel instructions. Other users described the target role as a "glorified human compiler."
*   **The State of Software Engineering:** The high barrier to entry sparked a broader debate about developer competency. Some argued that the industry suffers from "software bloat" because modern web developers rely heavily on frameworks without understanding the underlying fundamentals (e.g., plain JavaScript or memory management).
*   **Algorithms Debate:** A sub-thread emerged regarding sorting algorithms. While some users argued that implementing sort functions is indistinguishable from using built-in libraries for most jobs, others shared anecdotes where understanding basic algorithms (like using insertion sort for nearly-sorted data) resulted in significant performance gains over standard library implementations (like C++ `qsort`).

### OpenAI API Logs: Unpatched data exfiltration

#### [Submission URL](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/openai-api-logs-unpatched-data-exfiltration) | 47 points | by [takira](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=takira) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46710569)

OpenAI API Logs can exfiltrate data via Markdown image rendering, researchers claim

- What happened: A security team says OpenAI’s Platform API log viewer (for “responses” and “conversations”) renders Markdown images, enabling a data exfiltration attack. An attacker poisons a data source with an indirect prompt injection that makes the model output a Markdown image whose URL includes sensitive data as query params. Even if the app blocks rendering (e.g., LLM-as-judge, CSP, sanitization, or plaintext UI), the malicious response may be flagged and later opened in OpenAI’s API logs—where the image auto-loads and leaks the data to the attacker’s domain.  
- Scope: Beyond API logs, the researchers say Agent Builder, Assistant Builder, Chat Builder preview environments, ChatKit Playground, and the Starter ChatKit app are also impacted.  
- Vendor response: Reported via BugCrowd; the researchers say OpenAI closed it as “Not applicable” after four follow-ups.  
- Why it matters: This shifts the exfiltration point from end-user apps (where teams often harden Markdown/image rendering) to developer tooling and review workflows. Any app mixing sensitive data with untrusted sources (e.g., KYC flows) could leak PII when a dev opens flagged logs.  
- Mitigations (pragmatic):  
  - Treat AI ops surfaces like production: don’t auto-load remote content in logs; use network egress allowlists, image proxying, or offline/raw-log viewers.  
  - Strip or neutralize Markdown before storing/reviewing logs; review in a browser profile with remote content blocked.  
  - Add detection for model-generated URLs carrying user data; alert or redact before logs reach UI.  
  - Minimize ingestion of untrusted content or gate it through sanitizing fetchers.

Note: These are researchers’ claims; OpenAI reportedly disputed applicability.

Here is a summary of the Hacker News discussion:

**Technical Assessment and Mitigations**
The community largely agreed that rendering Markdown images within a raw log viewer is a security flaw. Users argued that log viewers should display raw text for debugging purposes; rendering remote content defeats this purpose and introduces the risk of "Stored XSS-style" attacks (though technically limited to data exfiltration via image requests rather than JavaScript execution). Several commenters questioned why OpenAI does not implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to block arbitrary third-party image loading in their dashboard, identifying this as the primary technical failure.

**Clarifying the Attack Vector**
There was some initial confusion regarding the threat model, with some users questioning why developers seeing user data was being treated as a vulnerability. Others clarified that this is an *Indirect Prompt Injection* attack:
1.  **The Trap:** An external attacker poisons data (e.g., a website or social media profile) that an AI application ingests.
2.  **The Trigger:** The application blocks the initial malicious response but logs it for review.
3.  **The Leak:** When a developer views the log, the browser automatically renders the Markdown image, sending a request—containing sensitive data in the URL parameters—back to the attacker’s server.

**Vendor Response and Bug Bounty Issues**
Significant discussion focused on OpenAI supposedly closing the report as "Not Applicable." Commenters speculated that bug bounty platforms (like BugCrowd) prioritize speed over quality, leading triagers who may not understand complex logic bugs to dismiss valid reports. One user corroborated this pattern, claiming they reported a similar exfiltration vulnerability in OpenAI’s Agent Builder in December that was also dismissed.

**Critique of the Submission**
While acknowledging the vulnerability is real, some users criticized the article's structure. They felt it read too much like a marketing piece for the researchers' product ("PromptArmor"), making it difficult to skim for the actual technical details. However, even critics agreed that the underlying finding—that the log viewer lacks basic CSP protections—is valid.

### Comic-Con Bans AI Art After Artist Pushback

Comic-Con bans AI art from its official art show after artist backlash

- What changed: San Diego Comic-Con quietly updated its art show rules to prohibit any work created partly or wholly with AI, reversing a years-long policy that allowed labeled, not-for-sale AI pieces (including “style of” disclosures). The change came within 24 hours of artists calling out the policy online.

- Who pushed back: Comic and concept artists Tiana Oreglia and Karla Ortiz mobilized peers, arguing that allowing AI images normalizes exploitative tech trained on artists’ work and accelerates job erosion. Ortiz pointed to Marvel’s Secret Invasion AI title sequence and Coca-Cola’s AI-driven ads as signs studios are replacing early-stage ideation and storyboard work.

- Behind the scenes: Oreglia says art show organizer Glen Wooten told her he opposed genAI but needed public pressure to get the ban approved. Comic-Con didn’t comment to 404 Media.

- Why it matters: A flagship creative institution siding with artists signals growing resistance to generative AI in professional art spaces. Expect similar policies to spread to other conventions and galleries—even as AI imagery continues to surface on show floors and in adjacent events.

Here is a summary of the top story and the discussion surrounding it.

### **Comic-Con Bans GenAI from Art Show**
In a reversal of its previous policy, San Diego Comic-Con has quietly updated its rules to ban all artwork created partly or wholly with generative AI from its official art show. The move follows immediate backlash from prominent artists, including Karla Ortiz and Tiana Oreglia, who argued that permitting AI imagery normalizes technology built on the non-consensual scraping of human work and accelerates the erosion of creative jobs. While organizers privately opposed AI, they reportedly required public pressure to justify the ban. This decision marks a significant institutional stance against AI in professional creative spaces, a trend expected to spread to other conventions.

### **Discussion Summary**
The Hacker News discussion focuses on the philosophical borders of "art," the ethics of training data, and historical comparisons to previous technological shifts.

**Is it Art, Product, or Theft?**
A significant portion of the debate centers on whether AI creations can be defined as art or if they are simply commercial products.
*   **The "Factory" Argument:** User **scfy** draws parallels to Andy Warhol’s "Factory" and mass production, as well as Marcel Duchamp’s readymades (e.g., *Fountain*), arguing that art has long been commercialized and that "thing-ness" (the physical object) often matters more than the effort. They suggest the resistance to AI is similar to the initial resistance to photography.
*   **The Counterpoint:** User **hddnnpln** disputes this, arguing that referencing Duchamp or Warhol ignores that those works were critiques of consumerism/art, whereas AI is simply a tool for mass production without the critical intent. **rprdcr** calls the Warhol comparison a "trap" for those with little art history knowledge, noting that while masters had apprentices, the master still directed the vision, whereas AI removes the human element entirely.
*   **Definition:** User **t0bia_s** takes a hardline stance, stating "generative art" is an oxymoron and should be termed "kitsch," while **jzzmn** argues that the value of an "Artist Alley" is the connection between the patron and the human creator, which AI severs.

**Copyright and Training Ethics**
The conversation shifts from aesthetics to legality and morality regarding how AI models are built.
*   **spwa4** and **rckydrll** discuss the asymmetry of copyright enforcement. They argue that while individuals face massive fines for piracy, AI companies indiscriminately ingest copyrighted works to build for-profit models without penalty. **spwa4** suggests that if corporations were held to the same statutory damages as individuals (e.g., per willful infringement), companies like OpenAI would be bankrupt.
*   **jltsrn** notes that regardless of the legal definition, many artists view the uncompensated training on their work as a violation of moral rights.

**Historical Context & "Cheating"**
*   **DocTomoe** and **AJ007** recall the early days of digital art, noting that using Photoshop, layers, or the "undo" button was once considered "cheating" by traditionalists.
*   However, others distinguish AI from these tools. **whtvrcct** argues that AI is not just a new medium (like the jump from physical to digital) but a fundamental replacement of the creative act.
*   **andyfilms1** suggests they are fine with AI existing as a category, provided it isn't presented as handmade, noting that the real issue is the deception regarding the effort and origin of the piece.

### The Agentic AI Handbook: Production-Ready Patterns

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nibzard.com/agentic-handbook) | 204 points | by [SouravInsights](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SouravInsights) | [142 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46701969)

Agentic AI is a loop, not magic: a production pattern guide and a 30‑minute on‑ramp

The post argues that “agentic AI” isn’t a new model trick—it’s a software shape: an LLM running inside a loop with tools, state, and clear stopping conditions. Demos are easy; making that loop reliable in production is the real work. It introduces a production‑minded pattern library (Awesome Agentic Patterns and agentic-patterns.com) focused on closing the demo‑to‑production gap.

Key points:
- Start with two habits: diff‑first (review every change) and loop‑first (run to clear exit conditions like tests, lints, evals).
- A practical 30‑minute on‑ramp: pick a small task, establish a single pass/fail command, constrain scope, demand a stepwise plan with checkpoints, accept changes only via diffs, run tests, repeat until green.
- When agents aren’t worth it: faster to do by hand, no deterministic validation, ambiguous “done,” or high-risk privileges.
- When they are: clear acceptance criteria, objective signals, repetitive or mechanical changes, and tightly constrained scope. Most “agent failures” are loop design failures, not model failures.
- Interest spiked in late Dec 2025; the repo sits around 2.8k stars mid‑Jan 2026, likely driven by HN visibility, maturing CLI/IDE tools, and people finally putting in focused time.
- Public signals: Linus Torvalds finds AI useful for low‑risk hobby code but not critical systems; Tobias Lütke says AI use is baseline at Shopify; Armin Ronacher urges hands‑on trial time; Ryan Dahl claims “writing syntax directly” is waning.

Why it matters: Teams shipping agents should optimize loops, constraints, and reviewability—not just prompts. If you try one thing, make every change go through diffs and a single definitive test command.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reveals a sharp divide between the theoretical promise of "agentic patterns" and the current reality of using them, with many commenters expressing frustration over tooling reliability and workflow integration.

**Skepticism and Tooling Friction**
*   **"Banging rocks together":** Several users, including **lknt**, feel that current agent-specific IDEs and CLIs introduce more friction than they solve. They report that agents struggle with simple context, fail to apply execution diffs correctly, and create "merge hell."
*   **Copy-paste vs. Integration:** There is a recurring debate over whether specialized tools offer real value over Copy-Pasting from ChatGPT. **Bewelge** argues that the time saved by avoiding copy-paste is negligible compared to the "thinking time" needed for debugging, claiming that manual coding helps formulate the problem in the brain—a sentiment echoed by references to DHH feeling "competence draining from fingers."
*   **Success Stories:** Conversely, **CurleighBraces** shares a strong success story using `codex` (CLI) to fix a hard crash in an embedded device in minutes, arguing that the tool's ability to "jump in" and read the repo offers a paradigm shift over manual context gathering.

**The "Test-First" Reality**
*   **Agents writing tests:** A major critique (started by **prttygd**) focuses on agents failing to write usable tests for existing code. **mbddng-shp** argues that asking an LLM to generate tests is dangerous; they often produce "garbage assertions" that provide 100% coverage but test nothing of value.
*   **Inverted Workflow:** The consensus among successful users (like **thrchs**) is that the human must remain the architect of the constraints. The recommended workflow is not "Agent, write tests," but rather "Human writes the test harness/specs; Agent writes code until the test passes."

**Expectations vs. Reality**
*   **The "Natural Language" Fallacy:** **galaxyLogic** and **Nekobai** debate whether AI tools should be intuitive enough to work with vague instructions. Some argue that if an AI requires a "manual" to operate, it fails the promise of natural language interfaces; others counter that complex software engineering still requires precise specifications, regardless of the interface.
*   **AI Reviewing AI:** **theshrike79** outlines a multi-model workflow where a "smarter" model (Claude Opus) plans and a cheaper model implements, followed by an AI code review step, suggesting that reliable loops might require pitting models against each other.
