### Neal Stephenson was prescient about our AI age

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/chatbots-ai-neal-stephenson-diamond-age/677364/) | 137 points | by [Rant423](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Rant423) | [309 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39287616)

Neal Stephenson, the acclaimed science fiction author, is considered to be remarkably prescient in predicting technological advancements. In his 1995 novel, The Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, he envisioned a future where the protagonist has a personalized and ultra-advanced chatbot as a tutor and mentor. This fictional device, known as the Primer, adapts to the learning style of the young girl and speaks in the voice of a live actor.

Stephenson recently discussed his novel and the current state of AI with Matteo Wong. While he acknowledges the progress made in AI technologies like generative AI models, such as ChatGPT, he remains more pessimistic about AI's capabilities compared to the Primer. According to him, current chatbots are essentially statistics engines that generate coherent-sounding sentences, rather than oracles with true intelligence.

Stephenson also points out the limitations of current generative AI models when it comes to education. While these models can generate sentences that sound correct, they lack the underlying intelligence to discern whether the information is actually accurate. He suggests that for educational purposes, it would be more beneficial to focus on understanding each learner's style and connecting them with the most suitable learning resources.

Despite the advancements in generative AI, Stephenson draws attention to the need for specialized abilities in AI applications. He compares the application of language models like GPT-4 to medical diagnosis or tutoring to "pseudo-intelligence," highlighting the limitations and potential pitfalls of using these models in areas where they lack expertise.

Overall, Stephenson's insights provide valuable perspectives on the current state of AI and its potential limitations in comparison to the imaginative concepts presented in his novel.

The discussion about Neal Stephenson's novel and his views on AI on Hacker News covers various topics and perspectives. Some users discuss the accuracy of science fiction predictions in general, while others mention specific examples from Stephenson's books. There's also a debate about the different worldviews and disagreements among people, with one user mentioning the portrayal of China in Stephenson's work as an example.

Another user suggests that eventually, AI chatbots will become more human-like, while others express concerns about the impact of AI on personal interactions. There is also a discussion about the internet and the need for digital identities in online communication.

Some users mention other authors and novels that they consider favorites or relevant to the discussion. The conversation shifts to the challenges of explaining things on the internet and the difficulty of reaching a common reality due to discussions being influenced by propaganda and differing perspectives. There's also a mention of paid commenters and trolls.

In summary, the discussion covers a range of topics related to science fiction predictions, AI, worldviews, the internet, and the challenges of online discussions.
