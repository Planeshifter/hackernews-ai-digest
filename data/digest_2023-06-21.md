### Giving LLM’s a Backspace Token

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05426) | 76 points | by [bilsbie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bilsbie) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36425375)

Researchers Chris Cundy and Stefano Ermon have developed a new method called SequenceMatch for autoregressive sequence modeling with backtracking. Unlike the traditional maximum-likelihood objective method, SequenceMatch involves imitation learning (IL), allowing for a variety of divergences between the generated and dataset sequences, including those generated out of distribution. The model can also incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. SequenceMatch training has shown improvements in text generation over MLE on language models. The paper outlines the SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models. The discussion on the submission revolves around the latency and interactivity of the models and how they could be used in practical applications. Some have raised concerns about the validity of the evaluation metrics used in the study, while others have suggested exploring Beam search as an alternative to backtracking.

### How RLHF Works

#### [Submission URL](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/how-rlhf-works) | 159 points | by [natolambert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=natolambert) | [31 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36418807)

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) works when two conditions are met, according to Nathan Lambert, who says there needs to be some signal showing that applying vanilla supervised learning only does not work and a complex optimization landscape that needs to slowly change over time to achieve success. The setup, however, is hard and Lambert explains it using the example of generating chat agents that are both helpful and not spewing toxic statements, which requires a capable language large model to follow instructions and applying a combination of fine-tunings and systems engineering for the harm reduction half. Data practices that can tank model performance, such as imitating models and using imperfect datasets, should also be avoided.

The submission is about reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and how it works only under specific conditions, as explained by Nathan Lambert. Successful RLHF requires a signal that demonstrates that applying supervised learning algorithms does not work and a complex optimization landscape that changes slowly over time. The discussion revolved around various topics such as the Direct Preference Optimization paper, resources for RLHF, the applications of RLHF, and the challenges associated with creating models that generate content that conforms to human values. One commenter stressed the importance of honesty and truthfulness in the development of models, while others discussed the limitations of RLHF based on the data and features of the model.

Dropbox has launched two new AI-powered tools, Dash and AI, designed to aid knowledge workers in their tasks. The universal search Dash is a machine-learning powered tool for finding information across multiple platforms, such as Salesforce and Google Workspace, in one place. Dash can also organise links, create quick-access start pages and will soon answer users' questions and offer insights via generative AI. Meanwhile, AI summarises files such as contracts and meetings recordings; with one click, users can get a concise summary of the information they need. Alongside this, Dropbox has launched a $50m venture initiative called Dropbox Ventures for AI-focused startups.

Some of the commenters on the thread were critical of Dropbox's focus on AI tools, with one user suggesting that the company should concentrate on improving their core product. Another user expressed concern over the privacy policy, pointing out that Dropbox permits the analysis of the contents of a single document. Another user complained about the use of buzzwords like "cold storage." However, another commenter defended AI as a useful tool and congratulated Dropbox on their recent venture initiative for AI startups. The thread also included a link to a TechCrunch article with more information about Dropbox's launch of AI tools and venture initiative.

### Humans aren’t mentally ready for an AI-saturated ‘post-truth world’

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/generative-ai-deepfakes-disinformation-psychology/) | 290 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [485 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36417252)

As AI-powered tools become more ubiquitous in daily life, there are legitimate concerns about how these systems will impact individuals and society at large. For instance, AI-generated content could facilitate the spread of disinformation and further erode people's sense of trust. Additionally, as humans become more reliant on AI to perform tasks, we may become less capable of learning new things or completing tasks independently. However, some experts suggest that AI could eventually help alleviate the loneliness epidemic, as people may come to see AI as a friend. Ultimately, much more research is needed to understand the psychological effects of living in an AI-dominated world.

The comments present a range of opinions on the subject, including discussions about the effects of the internet, the importance of critical thinking and mistrust of corporations, and the relationship between language and thought. Some commenters suggest that the negative consequences of the widespread use of AI may be limited if people are able to adapt and find ways to control and regulate the technology. Others argue that the risks are too great and that we should proceed with caution.
