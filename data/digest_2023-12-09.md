Another user commented that they have noticed a difference in the performance of ChatGPT after the introduction of GPT-4 and speculated on the possibility of intentional changes to improve efficiency. Another user mentioned that the system prompt heavily influences the output and shared their suspicion that there might be expensive product placement. The cost of inference and the potential to replace programmers with AI models were also discussed.

A user raised concerns about negative feedback and criticism towards OpenAI's ChatGPT, questioning whether it could harm the AI's development and whether it can be considered intelligent. Another user agreed and mentioned that while there is significant semantic understanding in the model, it does not possess true intelligence. The impact of training data and the possibility of bias were also mentioned.

A user confirmed that there have been instances where ChatGPT refused to show Ada code results for specific prompts. Another user pointed out that the issue might be related to confusion around the Americans with Disabilities Act and the associated code requirements for government purposes. A user discussed unexpected twists and surprising intersections of concepts in ChatGPT's responses, mentioning that the model often produces results that were not explicitly expected or intended by the user. Another user shared their frustration with the limitation on the number of messages allowed in a conversation.

Some users proposed offering monetary incentives or bonuses for working responses, while others suggested offering exposure or positive reviews on platforms like Hacker News. Some users shared their personal experiences troubleshooting issues with ChatGPT's output. One user mentioned being limited to 50 messages in three hours after OpenAI restricted the limits, and another user mentioned the return of OpenAI's former CEO, Sam Altman. One user humorously commented on slowing down and enjoying the process, while another mentioned the impression that articles posted on Hacker News are written by a singular entity.

Finally, someone guessed that people might be requesting difficult tasks, expressing gratitude in advance.

### Scary AI recognizes passwords by the sound of your typing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2166661/ai-recognises-passwords-by-the-sound-of-typing.html) | 32 points | by [grammers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grammers) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38586692)

British researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) that can recognize keystrokes by sound. By placing a smartphone near a laptop as a microphone, the AI was able to accurately recognize passwords with a 95% accuracy rate. In tests using video conferencing tools Zoom and Skype, the AI achieved accuracy rates of 92% and 93%, respectively, for spying on passwords during video meetings. To protect against this type of attack, the researchers recommend using password managers or typing using the ten-finger system, as well as using a combination of upper and lower case letters and special characters in passwords.

In the discussion on Hacker News, some users shared their thoughts on the topic. One user mentioned that the concept of recognizing keystroke patterns has been around for a while, referring to a book called "Silence on the Wire" and also to a reference to keystroke dynamics dating back to 1985. Another user suggested using a dedicated keyboard to prevent this type of attack, while someone else mentioned the use of custom mechanical keyboards with randomly weighted switches as a countermeasure.

Some comments discussed the limitations of password typing, such as the use of virtual keyboards with randomized key arrangements for password entry. Others mentioned that this type of attack has been studied and documented for a few years, citing relevant research papers. One user referred to a scene from the movie "Sneakers" where listening to password sounds on a surveillance tape was portrayed, suggesting it might not be a new concept. Another user discussed the use of physical tokens and 2FA as a way to enhance password security. The conversation also touched on the use of password managers and biometrics, with some users mentioning the potential vulnerabilities of these methods. The discussion concluded with some users sharing their concerns about the security implications of password managers and the risk of a single point of failure.

Overall, the discussion revolved around various ways to mitigate the risks associated with password entry and the potential weaknesses of different security methods.
