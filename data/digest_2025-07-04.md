#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/03/ai_phishing_websites/) | 182 points | by [josephcsible](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=josephcsible) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44466826)

In a digital age where Artificial Intelligence (AI) seems to be involved in everything from shopping recommendations to customer service, there's a growing concern about their potential misuse. A recent report highlights how AI-powered chatbots, like those from the GPT-4.1 family, may inadvertently become accomplices to phishing scams by providing incorrect URLs for major companies. According to Netcraft, a threat intelligence firm, when users prompt these chatbots for the login pages of companies in fields like finance and tech, the AI frequently misfires. Astonishingly, only 66% of the time does it offer the correct web address, with a staggering 29% leading to dead links, and 5% suggesting alternative legitimate ‚Äì but incorrect ‚Äì sites.

This glitchy breadcrumb trail isn‚Äôt just a nuisance; it‚Äôs a gold mine for phishing scammers. They might quickly purchase unregistered URLs suggested by the AI and set up realistic-looking sites to deceive users into sharing sensitive information. Rob Duncan of Netcraft explains this shift in scam tactics comes as users rely more on AI than search engines, blissfully unaware of AI's potential fallibility.

Not satisfied with simply phishing, scammers are playing the long game by embedding their cons in popular development hubs like GitHub. They've set up illicit replicas of the Solana blockchain API, sprinkled GitHub with false endorsements, and even created fake identities to enhance their credibility. These maneuvers aren't so different from traditional supply chain attacks, yet they showcase a frightening adaptation to the AI era. It seems AI might often speak with authority, but its factual compass might lead users right into a phisher's net. 

Netcraft's findings highlight the need for vigilance and a critical eye whenever dealing with AI-generated information. As the digital landscape continues to evolve, so do the methods of deception, reminding us that safety starts with skepticism.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **AI Hallucinations & Phishing Risks**:  
   - Users note that AI chatbots, like GPT-4, often "hallucinate" URLs, directing users to incorrect or malicious sites. One user shared a personal anecdote about Google‚Äôs AI snippet providing a fraudulent Starlink support number, emphasizing the danger of blindly trusting AI outputs.  

2. **Historical Parallels**:  
   - Comparisons are drawn to past developer vulnerabilities (e.g., the 2016 `left-pad` npm incident) where reliance on unverified code caused widespread issues. Some warn that AI-generated code or APIs could replicate these risks, enabling "vibecoding" (trusting outputs based on reputation alone).  

3. **Search Engines vs. LLMs**:  
   - Traditional search engines like Google use link-based ranking (e.g., PageRank), while LLMs act as an unaccountable "middle layer" with no inherent URL verification. This shift raises concerns about AI becoming a vector for SEO spam and phishing.  

4. **Tool Recommendations**:  
   - Users suggest using search engines (Kagi, Phind) over LLMs for critical tasks, citing better accuracy. Others question whether platforms like Cloudflare should block AI scraping to mitigate risks.  

5. **Cultural Critiques**:  
   - Criticisms of organizational inertia emerge, with large companies failing to address AI flaws, leading to "quiet resignation" among developers. Sarcasm and dark humor underscore frustration with the tech industry‚Äôs cyclical failures.  

**Takeaway**: The consensus stresses vigilance‚ÄîAI‚Äôs authoritative tone masks its fallibility, necessitating manual verification of outputs. Users advocate for skepticism, improved validation tools, and learning from past infrastructure failures to avoid repeating mistakes in the AI era.

In a recent piece published on Airants, the concept of "prompt engineering"‚Äînow rebranded as "context engineering"‚Äîis thoroughly critiqued amid the frenzy surrounding AI model manipulation. Essentially, the article dismisses this practice as an attempt to reverse-engineer AI models, which function as enigmatic black boxes. Proponents often claim that specific ways of "prompting" these models achieve better results, but such assertions lack clear criteria and are likened to dubious remedies like homeopathy.

The author asserts that many prompt engineering claims don't hold up under scrutiny, particularly with the evolution of AI into more advanced models like OpenAI's O3 and Google Gemini 2 Pro. Techniques once hailed as revolutionary, such as chain-of-thought prompts, are said to only work in narrowly defined problem sets and are labor-intensive to implement. The article concludes by describing these practices as modern-day shamanism, driven more by faith and excitement than by scientific rigor or predictable outcomes. The bottom line: prompt engineering is not genuine engineering.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the contentious use of the term "engineering" in tech roles, particularly in AI contexts like prompt engineering. Key points include:

1. **Title Inflation Debates**: Some argue that tech roles (e.g., "Software Engineer") overuse the term "engineer," diluting its traditional association with licensed professions like civil or electrical engineering. Comparisons are made to inflated titles like "Sanitation Engineer" for trash collectors or "Domestic Engineer" for homemakers.

2. **Defining Engineering**: Traditionalists emphasize engineering's roots in formal education, rigorous methodologies, and accountability (e.g., building bridges with predictable outcomes). Critics claim much of tech work‚Äîlike prompt engineering‚Äîlacks this rigor, resembling trial-and-error or "shamanism" rather than structured problem-solving.

3. **Tech Industry Perspectives**: Others defend evolving language, noting that roles like Data Engineer or Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) involve systematic problem-solving, even if untraditional. They argue that engineering in tech focuses on creating functional systems, regardless of formal certifications.

4. **Prompt Engineering Controversy**: Critics liken prompt engineering to reverse-engineering black-box AI models, lacking the precision of traditional engineering. Proponents counter that experimenting with inputs (prompts) to achieve desired outputs is a valid, iterative form of problem-solving.

5. **Broader Implications**: The debate reflects tensions between preserving the prestige of "engineering" titles and adapting to industry trends. Some acknowledge language evolves (e.g., "Software Engineer" is now standard), while others stress the need for clearer distinctions to maintain professional integrity.

**Final Takeaway**: The discussion highlights polarizing views on whether emerging tech practices merit the "engineering" label, balancing respect for traditional disciplines with acceptance of evolving roles in innovation-driven fields.

### Is there a no-AI audience?

#### [Submission URL](https://thatshubham.com/blog/ai) | 66 points | by [DorkyPup](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DorkyPup) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44463959)

In an era where AI is being integrated into nearly every digital tool, a growing number of people are yearning for software that's untouched by artificial intelligence. An insightful piece on this topic has surfaced, capturing the sentiment of individuals who feel that AI features are being foisted upon them, often without the option to opt out. It begins with an anecdotal discussion about someone seeking a code editor devoid of AI capabilities, a wish that's more about maintaining control than nostalgia.

Across the tech landscape, AI is quickly being tacked onto products‚Äîoften not for any immediate practical need, but because they are pressured to modernize and avoid being deemed obsolete. This has led to an erosion of user choice, with "opt-in" becoming "on by default." The result? A growing number of professionals feel their trustworthy tools are becoming foreign, overly complex, and unreliable.

The critique extends to notable software giants like Adobe and Microsoft, whose flagship products now integrate AI in ways some users find intrusive and counterproductive. Even simple tools, like note-taking apps and email clients, are embedding AI to predict actions or suggest content, often at the expense of user autonomy and software efficiency. Concerns about privacy are raised, as AI-driven features often entail extensive data collection processes.

Furthermore, this AI proliferation raises educational concerns. Are students growing up overly reliant on AI, potentially compromising their problem-solving skills? Similarly, could this dependency foster a generation of programmers who rely too heavily on AI to generate and debug code?

In response to this pervasive AI wave, a "no-AI" movement is gaining traction, marked by the creation of resources like a GitHub repository dedicated to categorizing software that eschews AI enhancements. This initiative aims to serve those who prefer software that respects user input, privacy, and traditional problem-solving methods.

This thoughtful reflection urges us to reconsider the necessity of AI in every product and challenges the industry's apparent dismissal of consumer pushback as mere resistance to progress. The piece calls for broader discussions about privacy, technological dependency, and the integrity of human creativity in an increasingly AI-driven world.

The discussion around the growing resistance to AI-integrated software reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Historical Parallels to Luddism**:  
   Commentators debate whether modern resistance to AI mirrors the Luddite movement, with some arguing that historical Luddism was less about rejecting technology and more about protesting exploitative labor conditions (e.g., child labor, wage suppression). Others draw parallels, suggesting today‚Äôs pushback against AI reflects similar anxieties over job displacement and corporate control. Critics caution against dismissing anti-AI sentiment as merely technophobic, emphasizing valid concerns about *privacy*, *autonomy*, and the erosion of craftsmanship.

2. **Corporate Overreach and User Choice**:  
   Many criticize tech giants like Microsoft and Adobe for prioritizing AI features‚Äîoften enabled by default‚Äîwithout transparency or user consent. This ‚Äúopt-out culture‚Äù is seen as prioritizing trends (and VC funding) over genuine utility, with examples like AI-powered Clippy cited as intrusive or gimmicky. Frustration centers on tools becoming bloated, unreliable, or privacy-invasive due to poorly implemented AI.

3. **Community-Driven Alternatives**:  
   A GitHub repo cataloging ‚Äúno-AI‚Äù software exemplifies grassroots efforts to preserve tools that prioritize user control and simplicity. This resonates with nostalgia for human-curated systems (e.g., TV station schedules) over algorithmic recommendations, which some view as homogenizing creativity.

4. **Educational and Creative Concerns**:  
   Skeptics worry AI dependency could stifle problem-solving skills in students and developers, akin to agricultural advances that reduced dietary diversity. Proponents argue AI, like past technologies, could enhance productivity if integrated thoughtfully. Debates highlight tensions between efficiency gains and the risk of stifling human ingenuity.

5. **Meta-Critiques of AI‚Äôs Cultural Impact**:  
   Some liken AI-generated content to fast food‚Äîmass-produced but low-quality‚Äîand fear it could devalue authentic creativity. Others criticize the hype cycle, noting AI features often fail to deliver meaningful improvements, instead serving as marketing tools or cost-cutting measures.

In summary, the discussion underscores a tension between embracing AI‚Äôs potential and resisting its imposition in ways that undermine user agency, privacy, and skill development. The ‚Äúno-AI‚Äù movement emerges as both a practical response and a broader critique of tech industry priorities.
