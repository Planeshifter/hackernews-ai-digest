#### [Submission URL](https://danluu.com/ai-bias/) | 57 points | by [davezatch](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=davezatch) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40703751)

The discussion around bias in ML/AI models continues to be a hot topic, with recent examples highlighting the challenges faced in addressing biases inherent in language models and generative AI. One noteworthy incident involved Playground AI (PAI) generating a professional LinkedIn profile photo by transforming an Asian woman's face to that of a white woman with blue eyes, sparking debate on bias in AI outputs.

The reaction to such incidents varies, with some dismissing them as not indicative of bias. Critics point out that models often exhibit skewed representations, such as an overabundance of Asian faces in certain datasets, leading to skewed outputs. Playground AI's CEO defended the model's output, likening it to a single dice roll and questioning the assumption of bias based on a singular result.

Further investigations revealed similar bias patterns in other prompts, where the model consistently favored white and stereotypical representations across various professions and ethnicities. These findings underscore the systemic issue of bias prevalent in many AI systems, including those deployed by major tech companies.

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing bias in AI models to ensure fair and accurate outcomes. It highlights the need for thorough checks and safeguards to mitigate biases and promote inclusivity in AI technologies.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-ai-cameras-emotions-uk-train-passengers/) | 74 points | by [amunozo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amunozo) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40709824)

Thousands of train passengers in the United Kingdom may have unknowingly had their faces scanned by Amazon's image recognition software during AI trials at major UK train stations like Euston, Waterloo, and Manchester Piccadilly. The AI surveillance technology was used to predict passengers' demographics, emotions, and behaviors, raising concerns about privacy and potential future use in advertising.

The trials conducted by Network Rail included object recognition and wireless sensors to enhance safety measures, such as detecting trespassing on tracks, monitoring platform overcrowding, and identifying antisocial behavior. However, the use of AI to analyze passenger demographics and emotions has drawn criticism from civil liberties advocates, citing concerns about the accuracy and ethical implications of such technology.

The documents obtained by civil liberties group Big Brother Watch revealed that the AI trials involved a combination of smart CCTV cameras and cloud-based analysis to monitor various scenarios. While some use cases were deemed successful, others, like emotion detection, were discontinued due to concerns about reliability.

Despite the potential benefits in enhancing security and safety measures, the widespread deployment of AI surveillance in public spaces without proper consultation has sparked debates about privacy and data protection. The AI trials' focus on passenger demographics and emotional analysis highlights the ongoing challenges and controversies surrounding the use of AI technology in public spaces.

The discussion on the Hacker News thread revolves around the use of AI technology for surveillance in public spaces, specifically in UK train stations. Users express concerns about the invasion of privacy and potential misuse of the technology.

### What is intelligent life? Portia Spiders and GPT

#### [Submission URL](https://aeon.co/essays/why-intelligence-exists-only-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder) | 41 points | by [FrustratedMonky](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FrustratedMonky) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40709700)

The concept of intelligence is a complex and ever-evolving one, especially when considering the wide array of creatures on Earth. From slime molds to fifth-graders, from shrimp to border collies, what truly defines intelligence? Abigail Desmond and Michael Haslam dive into this subject, challenging the notion of intelligence as a single, measurable entity and suggesting that it is a label we use to categorize a variety of traits that have helped different species thrive.

They argue that intelligence is a relative concept, existing only in relation to human expectations and evolving over time. While humans often associate intelligence with our evolutionary success, many other species have thrived without what we traditionally consider intelligent behavior. The authors propose that intelligence is a human construct that we project onto the world around us, leading to unexpected discoveries of intelligence in unexpected places.

In a world where intelligence is sought after in romantic partners, pets, leaders, and even AI programs, understanding and defining intelligence remains a challenge. The diversity of ways in which different species survive and thrive challenges our preconceived notions of intelligence, urging us to think beyond our human-centric view of the world.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the concept of intelligence and its different facets:

1. Users discuss the complexity of defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its specific cognitive capabilities, relating this to the challenges in AI research.
2. Recommendations are made for reading "A Brief History of Intelligence" and the books "Children of Time" and "Blindsight."
3. The conversation delves into the portrayal of intelligence in different species, such as Portia Spiders and the parallel drawn to female dominance in society.
4. Connections are made between "Deepness in the Sky" and "Blindsight" in terms of storytelling techniques.
5. References are shared regarding BEAM Robotics and the exploration of consciousness and copyright in thought experiments.
6. The discussion extends to thought experiments exploring consciousness in simulated environments, with references to related works by Greg Egan and philosophical arguments about consciousness in robots akin to zombies.

Overall, the comments showcase a deep dive into various aspects of intelligence, consciousness, literature recommendations, and philosophical musings related to the topic.

### Stable Diffusion 3 banned on CivitAI due to license

#### [Submission URL](https://civitai.com/articles/5732/temporary-stable-diffusion-3-ban) | 41 points | by [samspenc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samspenc) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40710133)

Civitai, a community known for its AI models, has announced a temporary ban on all Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) based models. This decision stems from concerns regarding the licensing terms associated with SD3, which could potentially give too much control to another AI entity, Stability AI. The community is taking a cautious approach by having their legal team review the license for clarity and seeking more information from Stability AI.  

The ban includes all models trained on content created with SD3 and any models that incorporate SD3 images in their datasets. The fear is that in the future, the rights to SD3 could be passed on to a new owner who may impose strict restrictions or impose fees on model creators.  

Despite the ban, Civitai encourages continued experimentation with SD3, advising model creators to be fully aware of the licensing terms before engaging with it. They highlight the emergence of alternative models without such limitations, offering hope for the community. The decision is made in the interest of protecting the community and its creators. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing situation.

The discussion on the submission "Temporary Stable Diffusion 3 Ban: Civitai Temporarily Bans SD3 Models Due to Licensing Uncertainty" covers a range of viewpoints and concerns regarding the ban on models based on Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3). One user raised the issue of potential copyright violations due to licensing uncertainty, while another user emphasized the importance of legal clarity and understanding the licensing terms before engaging with AI models. There are also discussions about the safety implications of SD3 models, comparisons between SD3 and SDXL models, and debates about the potential manipulation of weights in models like SDXL. Additionally, concerns are raised about the potential risks and ethical implications of training AI models on human-like content. Overall, the community is engaged in a thoughtful dialogue about the licensing, safety, and ethical considerations surrounding the use of SD3 models in the AI community.
