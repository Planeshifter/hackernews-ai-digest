### QLoRA: Efficient Finetuning of Quantized LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14314) | 282 points | by [Garcia98](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Garcia98) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36064568)

A new approach to finetuning quantized language models has been presented in a paper called QLoRA by Tim Dettmers and three other authors. The approach reduces memory usage enough to finetune a 65B parameter model on a single 48GB GPU while preserving full 16-bit finetuning task performance. The team use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models and provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations. They find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. The team release all of their models and code, including CUDA kernels for 4-bit training.

#### [Submission URL](https://ericsink.com/entries/depth.html) | 70 points | by [luu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=luu) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36055066)

GitHub has introduced its latest tool, GitHub Copilot, which is an AI pair programmer. While the accomplishment is impressive, Eric Sink wonders whether it is a step too far towards shallow understanding in the software development field. He notes that deep understanding is vital to the field, and that technical depth is important even though fewer people seem to value it. Copilot looks like it will be fun, but it remains to be seen whether or not it will replace the need for learning the fundamentals of programming.

The discussion about GitHub Copilot, an AI pair programmer, includes opinions on the value of deep understanding and technical depth in software development. Some users argue that abstractions and generalists are valuable, while others believe that understanding fundamental concepts is more important. The use of AI in programming is seen as both helpful and potentially harmful in perpetuating shallow knowledge. The discussion also touches on the importance of building on existing standards and concepts rather than reinventing the wheel. The value of structured knowledge is debated, with some arguing that specific details can be found through AI-powered search while others believe that deep understanding and documentation are necessary. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of striking a balance between deep understanding and practical application in software development.

### The teens behind the Mirai botnet

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/mirai-botnet) | 222 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36056320)

In his new book, "Fancy Bear Goes Phishing: The Dark History of the Information Age, in Five Extraordinary Hacks", author Scott J. Shapiro tells the story of Paras Jha, the teen behind the Mirai botnet. Jha began with a relatively small distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on his college's registration website, but eventually grew his botnet to tens of thousands of infected IoT devices. The Mirai botnet, which became infamous for carrying out some of the largest DDoS attacks in history, was eventually taken down by law enforcement. Jha pleaded guilty to his role in creating and using Mirai, and was sentenced to six months in a halfway house and 2,500 hours of community service.

The submission discusses the story of Paras Jha, the teen behind the Mirai botnet, who was sentenced to six months in a halfway house and 2,500 hours of community service for creating and using the botnet. The discussion includes topics such as the UK's NCA launching advertising campaigns to identify potential customers of criminal DDoS attacks, the legality of DDoS-as-a-service providers, and the Computer Fraud Abuse Act which prohibits various actions that result in damage to a computer. Some comments touch on the effectiveness of rehabilitation and the importance of education in preventing cybercrime.

### App in Google Play turns malicious and sends mic recordings every 15 minutes

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/05/app-with-50000-google-play-installs-sent-attackers-mic-recordings-every-15-minutes/) | 28 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36062396)

A security researcher at ESET has discovered that iRecorder Screen Recorder, an Android app with over 50,000 downloads from Google Play, has been surreptitiously recording nearby audio every 15 minutes and sending it to the app developer without users' knowledge. The app was originally benign and allowed users to record the screens of their devices, but was later updated to remotely turn on the device mic and record sound, connect to an attacker-controlled server and upload audio and other sensitive files. The secret espionage functions were implemented using code from AhMyth, an open source remote access Trojan RAT and code taken from AhMyth was heavily modified.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the security and privacy implications of the iRecorder Screen Recorder Android app. Some users express concerns about the trustworthiness of Android devices, pointing out that the app was allowed to access the microphone without user consent. Others suggest that users review apps before installing them or rely on more secure alternatives. One user comments on the potential of AI to detect malware, while another expresses surprise that Google Play allowed the app to be listed without vetting for such malicious behavior.

### Nvidia shares spike 18% on forecast beat driven by A.I. chip demand

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q1-2024.html) | 37 points | by [tim_sw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tim_sw) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36063758)

Nvidia has reported better-than-expected earnings for the first quarter of its fiscal year 2024 and given a bullish forecast for the current quarter. The chipmaker said it expected sales of around $11 billion in Q2, more than 50% higher than Wall Street estimates of $7.15 billion. The strong performance was driven by surging demand for data centre products, which saw sales of $4.28 billion, a 14% YoY increase, while the gaming division's revenue dropped 38% to $2.24 billion. The automotive division, including self-driving technologies, grew 114% YoY but stood at under $300m in sales for the quarter.

The discussion about Nvidia's better-than-expected earnings in Q1 2024 suggests divided opinions on the stock's valuation and its long-term growth prospects. Some users believe that Nvidia's sales growth is unsustainable and that the hype around the company is overblown, recommending short-selling the stock. Others argue that Nvidia's dominance in the data center and AI computing markets justifies its high valuation and that the demand for its GPUs will continue to rise in the coming years. Some users also mention Nvidia's partnerships with AWS, Microsoft, and other large internet companies as a key factor in its growth story. One user points out that Nvidia's revenue from the gaming division has dropped significantly, although this is partially offset by the growth of its self-driving technology division.

The submission discusses the negative impact that short-term rentals, specifically Airbnb, can have on neighborhoods and communities. Individuals share stories of rental properties being listed on Airbnb and causing disturbance to neighbors via large parties and events. Others mention that Airbnb rentals were originally intended for individuals looking for a room to stay in and not a location for large parties, resulting in damage to neighboring properties. Some argue that Airbnb can be a source of income for homeowners and that the responsibility lies with the renters to be a responsible party. However, concerns continue regarding the negative effects short-term rentals can have on community wellbeing and the need for improvements in Airbnb regulations.
