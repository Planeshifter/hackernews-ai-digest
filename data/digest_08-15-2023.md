### Bayesian Flow Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037) | 81 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37134315)

A new paper titled "Bayesian Flow Networks" introduces a new class of generative models called Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs). BFNs modify the parameters of independent distributions using Bayesian inference based on noisy data samples. These modified parameters are then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. This generative procedure is similar to the reverse process of diffusion models but simpler since no forward process is required. The paper derives discrete and continuous-time loss functions for different types of data and proposes sample generation procedures. BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling and outperform existing discrete diffusion models on a character-level language modeling task. The network inputs for discrete data are on the probability simplex, making it possible to use gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains like language modeling. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The Tyrannosaurus rex, despite being extinct for millions of years, continues to captivate people's imaginations. Thanks to the likes of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, as well as the fascination of elementary-school children, the T. rex remains a widely recognized dinosaur. In scientific circles, the T. rex is known by its proper scientific name, Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex for short. This name follows the binomial nomenclature system, which assigns a two-part name (genus and species) to every species on Earth. While binomial names are important to scientists, they are rarely used in everyday conversation. However, they still play a vital role in fields like molecular biology and evolutionary ecology. The system of binomial nomenclature was developed by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century, and though widely known, his life and scientific contributions remain controversial. A new biography seeks to provide a comprehensive account of Linnaeus's life but grapples with the question of how he should be classified. Linnaeus, often considered the father of modern taxonomy, was born into a family of botanists and showed a keen interest in plants from a young age. Despite facing challenges in his education, Linnaeus went on to study medicine and became a pioneer in the field of botany.

The discussion surrounding this submission on Hacker News covers various topics related to taxonomy and the life of Carl Linnaeus, the father of modern taxonomy. Some users appreciate the scientific contributions of Linnaeus and discuss the importance of binomial nomenclature in fields like molecular biology and evolutionary ecology. Others share their personal experiences and perspectives on Linnaeus's work, including the influence of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg's portrayal of dinosaurs, the relevance of Linnaeus's system in classifying species today, and the controversy surrounding his life and categorization. One user mentions a biography about Linnaeus that attempts to provide a comprehensive account of his life but has issues in capturing the full essence of his work.

According to researchers from the University of California, Irvine, computers are now better at completing CAPTCHA tests than humans. CAPTCHA, which stands for Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart, is a common bot defense measure used by websites to identify low-risk human users. However, the study found that bots were able to complete the tests in less than a second with 99.8% accuracy, while humans took 9-15 seconds with an accuracy of just 50-84%. The researchers suggest that organizations should use "intelligent algorithms" to distinguish between bot and human interactions instead of relying solely on CAPTCHA.

The discussion surrounding the submission revolves around various aspects of CAPTCHA, spam, and bot behavior. 

One user suggests that relying solely on CAPTCHA is not sufficient because bots can easily mimic human behavior. They propose using behavioral analysis and intelligent algorithms to distinguish between bots and humans. Another user adds that intelligent bots can generate convincing reviews and engage in misleading behavior, which can pose a challenge for platforms that rely on user-generated content.

There is a debate about the effectiveness of microtransactions as a solution. Some argue that if people have to pay small amounts for access to services, it can help manage spam. However, others point out that people don't want to pay for such services, and implementing microtransactions may not be practical.

The discussion also touches upon the idea of using phone numbers for verification. Some users express concerns about privacy and the potential misuse of personal information. Others mention that relying on phone numbers may not be effective as they can be easily obtained and used for spamming.

There is also discussion about the limitations of CAPTCHAs and the need for better solutions. Some users suggest that trusting behavior-driven AI and using web integrity APIs can help tackle the challenges posed by bots.

The conversation extends to topics like online privacy, trust, and the impact of AI on the internet. There are varying opinions on the importance of privacy and the implications of AI and behavioral analysis. One user mentions the importance of trust and consent in internet interactions.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complex nature of combating spam and determining bot behavior, and it explores different approaches and their implications.

### What coal and Jevons’ paradox tell us about AI and data

#### [Submission URL](https://hex.tech/blog/jevons-paradox-demand-for-insight/) | 70 points | by [erehweb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erehweb) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129853)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the future of data jobs. Will computers replace human data practitioners? According to a blog post by Barry McCardel, the job of a data practitioner is more than just writing code or making charts. It involves formulating the right questions, anticipating the needs of stakeholders, and providing valuable insights. While AI can automate certain rote tasks, it is unlikely to replace the human element of data work.

McCardel draws a parallel to Jevons' Paradox, which observed that as coal-powered engines became more efficient, overall coal consumption increased. The same rebound effect could apply to AI and data. As the cost of generating insights decreases, the demand for data work and the number of questions that can be answered with data will likely increase. Organizations are supply-constrained when it comes to utilizing data, and AI can help unlock the untapped potential of data teams.

While AI will undoubtedly change how data practitioners work, McCardel argues that it will likely lead to an increased need for human hours rather than a decrease. The impact of data on organizations is far from reaching its theoretical limit, and AI can help data teams be more impactful. McCardel concludes by discussing Hex, a platform that enables the creation and sharing of interactive data products, and invites readers to explore opportunities with the company.

Overall, the blog post highlights the potential of AI to augment rather than replace human data practitioners, and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's main points about AI and the future of data jobs. One commenter agrees with the post, saying that AI may take over low-value tasks but will not replace the higher-level strategic work that humans can do. They argue that as technology progresses, there is a shift in the types of jobs available. Another commenter brings up the concern that AI may replace non-essential service vendors and result in organizational changes. 

There is also a discussion about the impact of automation on different types of jobs. Some argue that AI will lead to an increase in the need for human hours rather than a decrease. Others point out that certain jobs, like manual labor, may be more easily replaced by automation, while others believe that higher-skilled jobs will still be in demand. The potential impact on the middle class is also mentioned.

Another comment highlights the importance of natural language communication, social and emotional intelligence, and decision-making in certain professions, suggesting that AI may not fully replace these roles. However, another commenter challenges this notion, stating that AI has the potential to approximate decision-makers and replace jobs traditionally done by lower-skilled workers. They argue that humans are not horses and will adapt to new roles.

There is also a discussion about the current and future job market and the creation of new roles. Some argue that the current job market is not representative of the future, and there is uncertainty about the impact of AI on employment. Others discuss the changing dynamics in households and the increase in multiple jobs held by individuals.

Overall, the comments touch on various aspects of the impact of AI on jobs, the potential changes in the job market, and the role of humans in the age of automation.

Google Chrome is introducing a new feature that will allow users to summarize entire articles using built-in generative AI. The AI-powered Search Generative Experience (SGE) can already provide summaries of search results, and now it will also offer article summaries once users click on a link. The feature, known as "SGE while browsing," is being rolled out as an early experiment in Google's opt-in Search Labs program. Initially, it will be available on the Google app for Android and iOS, with plans to bring it to the Chrome browser on desktop soon after. The feature will only work on freely available articles and won't support paywalled content. Google is also making other enhancements to SGE, such as providing definitions and diagrams for certain words and improving summaries of coding information. The company has received positive user feedback on SGE so far and believes it will become a standard function of Search over time.

The discussion primarily revolves around a comparison between the new Chrome search feature and an existing tool called Kagi. One user points out that Kagi works with most browsers by using JavaScript, while Chrome's search feature seems to have limitations. Another user provides a bookmarklet code that allows users to use Kagi on Chrome by redirecting the page to the Kagi website.

### Elon Musk’s X is throttling traffic to news and websites he dislikes

#### [Submission URL](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/08/15/twitter-x-links-delayed/) | 190 points | by [c5karl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=c5karl) | [79 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37136858)

The company formerly known as Twitter, now called X, has been slowing down the speed at which users can access links to news organizations and online competitors like the New York Times and Facebook. This move appears to be targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner Elon Musk. Users who clicked a link on Musk's website were made to wait about five seconds before seeing the page. However, X began reversing the throttling on some sites hours after the story was first published. The delay affected the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that X uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is routed through the domain, allowing X to track and potentially throttle activity to targeted websites, potentially affecting traffic and ad revenue. Some of the targeted businesses have expressed concerns about the delays and the potential for targeted pressure on news organizations. Online companies invest heavily to ensure their websites open quickly, as even tiny delays can lead to users abandoning the site.

Some users discuss how the throttling of traffic to specific websites was observed and comment on the technical aspects of how this could be implemented. There are also debates about the ethics of such actions and whether X should be allowed to engage in practices that potentially stifle competition. Some users argue that as a private company, X has the right to regulate its platform as it sees fit, while others express concerns about the implications for free speech and fair competition. Additionally, there are discussions about Elon Musk's motivations and behavior, as well as comparisons to other platforms like Facebook and Twitter in terms of content moderation and censorship.
