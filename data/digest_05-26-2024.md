### To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language (2020)

#### [Submission URL](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) | 272 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [188 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40480913)

Neuroscientists from MIT have discovered that reading computer code does not engage the brain's language-processing centers, but rather activates a general-purpose brain network called the multiple demand network. This network, responsible for complex cognitive tasks like solving math problems, is not the same as the language network. The study suggests that understanding computer code is a unique cognitive process distinct from language and math. By analyzing brain activity while participants read code in Python and ScratchJr, the researchers found minimal involvement of language regions and stronger activation of the multiple demand network. This sheds light on how the brain processes coding differently from other cognitive tasks.

### Why is Sam Altman so obsessed with 'Her'? An investigation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/why-is-sam-altman-so-obsessed-with) | 25 points | by [grugagag](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grugagag) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40479167)

In a shocking turn of events, Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, has stirred up controversy by attempting to tie his company's products to the movie 'Her' in which Scarlett Johansson voices an AI named Samantha. Altman's extreme obsession with the film has led to questionable decisions, such as creating a ChatGPT voice similar to Johansson's without her consent.

The scandal reached new heights when Johansson publicly stated she had never agreed to lend her voice to OpenAI's project, prompting legal action. This debacle has raised concerns about Altman's motives and the ethical implications of his actions, especially considering the power dynamics and entitlement depicted in the movie 'Her.'

Critics speculate that Altman's fascination with 'Her' stems from its portrayal of AI as a tool for fulfilling one's desires, emotionally and sexually. The narrative of the film presents AI as a means of catering to individual needs, boosting egos, and providing companionship—themes that resonate with Altman's attempts to integrate AI technology into his company's products.

As the story unfolds, it becomes clear that Altman's misguided attempts to emulate the scenario in 'Her' have backfired, drawing criticism from the public and sparking a debate on the ethical use of AI. The fallout from this incident raises questions about the intersection of technology, ethics, and entertainment, highlighting the dangers of blurring the lines between fiction and reality in the pursuit of innovation.
