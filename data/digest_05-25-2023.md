#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/2012/08/before-the-fire/) | 12 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36069260)

NASA's Saturn-Apollo Applications (SAA) program aimed to make use of Apollo hardware and investments to continue with post-Apollo manned spaceflight. Launched in 1965, the SAA program proposed two objectives: Long-Duration Flights and Spaceflight Experiments. Long-Duration Flights aimed to measure the effects of space flights of increasing duration to establish the basic capabilities required for future manned space flight goals, while Spaceflight Experiments would cover space life sciences, astronomy, space physics, advanced lunar exploration, and space technology development. The program was expected to kick off in 1968 with missions AS-209, AS-210, AS-211, and AS-212, and would see 21 Saturn IB and 16 Saturn V launches by the end of 1973 under the Case I schedule, and up to 26 Saturn IB and 17 Saturn V launches under the more ambitious Case II schedule.

The discussion on the submission includes only two comments. 

The first comment is by user "pnwrst," who provides a link to an article on the Spaceflight History Blog that talks about the NASA's Saturn-Apollo Applications (SAA) program. 

The second comment is by user "pcrds," who criticizes the lack of captions in the article's main text. In response, user "JKCalhoun" agrees with the criticism and adds that the staff at the Spaceflight History Blog is fantastic. They also mention that the fascination with space exploration dates back to the 1960s and 70s, when optimistic charts and diagrams of lifting bodies and space stations were widely available in libraries.

### RFC: Enforcing Bounds Safety in C (-fbounds-safety) – Clang Front end

#### [Submission URL](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/rfc-enforcing-bounds-safety-in-c-fbounds-safety/70854) | 28 points | by [tambourine_man](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tambourine_man) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36066023)

In an effort to eliminate out-of-bounds memory access vulnerabilities in C, a proposed extension called -fbounds-safety has been introduced. This extension offers bounds annotations that programmers can use to attach bounds to pointers in order to ensure that the program does not access memory outside the specified bounds. The extension has been adopted on millions of lines of production C code and proven to work in a consumer operating system setting. It is designed to preserve the Application Binary Interface (ABI), interoperates well with plain C code, and can be adopted partially and incrementally while still providing safety benefits. Programmers can continue to compile source code with the extension using toolchains that do not support it and its adoption cost is relatively low. The programming model has been tested on large-scale, real-world C codebases, and feedback is sought to propose upstreaming and eventual standardization of the work.

The submission discusses a proposed extension, "-fbounds-safety" in C, aimed at eliminating out-of-bounds memory access vulnerabilities in C by attaching bounds annotations to pointers. The discussion in the comments highlights the importance of addressable memory and machine registers in systems programming and debates the practicality of adopting the extension in current C-source code. Some argue that the problem of bounds checked languages not being binary compatible with existing C-source is a key challenge, while others suggest that a precise implementation might mitigate the issue. The potential impact on runtime performance is also a topic of concern, though some argue that optimizing for safety is worth it. The commenters also reference ongoing research on experimental prototypes such as ARM Morello or Solaris SPARC, which implement similar features, and argue that adding bounds checking support in the C programming model is a step in the right direction.
