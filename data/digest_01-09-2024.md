### Translating blog posts with GPT-4, or: on hope and fear

#### [Submission URL](http://antirez.com/news/141) | 73 points | by [grep_it](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grep_it) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38932428)

In his blog post titled "Translating blog posts with GPT-4, or: on hope and fear," Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez, shares his process of writing blog posts and his experiment with using GPT-4 to translate his posts from Italian to English. Sanfilippo explains that his typical process involves thinking about a topic for weeks or months before writing a blog post. Once he has enough ideas, he spends about 30 minutes writing the post without focusing too much on the form. This approach allows him to quickly share his thoughts while juggling other responsibilities. However, he admits that this often results in blog posts that are poorly written, with limited vocabulary and grammar errors.

To address this issue, Sanfilippo decided to try a new approach for his post about LLMs and programming. He wrote the post in Italian and used GPT-4 to translate it into English. Surprisingly, he found that the translated post was much better in quality than his usual English posts. He was able to hear his own voice in the translation, and tools that detect AI-generated text couldn't tell the difference.
While the process may seem synthetic and raise concerns about losing confidence in writing English, Sanfilippo is uncertain about how his blog will be written in the future. He appreciates that the translated post represents his true voice in his mother tongue and wonders if English writing is somewhat of a bluff. He ponders whether style is more about sentence construction or vocabulary selection and believes it's a combination of both.
Sanfilippo concludes with a mix of hope and fear for the possibilities of machine-assisted communication. He sees the potential for machines to talk as a positive development for humanity but also worries about the potential laziness that AI could cultivate, with people no longer willing to put in the effort of learning a new language.
In the comments section of the blog post, readers can engage in further discussions.

The discussion on the blog post titled "Translating blog posts with GPT-4, or: on hope and fear" covers various topics related to machine translation and language learning.
