### We reverse-engineered Flash Attention 4

#### [Submission URL](https://modal.com/blog/reverse-engineer-flash-attention-4) | 120 points | by [birdculture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birdculture) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45399637)

A team dug into the newly released FA4 kernel and explains why it’s the fastest way to run Transformer attention on Nvidia’s Blackwell GPUs—reporting ~20% over cuDNN’s closed‑source kernels. The big win isn’t just new math; it’s a far more complex asynchronous pipeline inside each kernel launch. FA4 splits Q/K/V into tiles, streams K/V past Q tiles, and maps pipeline stages onto specialized warps, letting the warp scheduler keep hardware busy via producer/consumer barriers—think Unix pipes or async web servers, but on a GPU. Alongside the pipeline, two classic Tri Dao tricks show up: a faster approximate exp and a more efficient online softmax. The write‑up offers a “quick tour” for general software engineers and a “deep dive” with source links; there’s no official FA4 tech report yet, but the kernel code is open. Big picture: cheaper, faster attention for LLM inference and training, tuned for Blackwell’s SMs, with patterns (warp specialization, tiling, async barriers) that generalize to other high‑perf CUDA kernels.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Technical Appreciation for FA4 Analysis**:  
   Commenters praised the detailed breakdown of FlashAttention-4 (FA4), highlighting its asynchronous pipeline design, warp specialization, and optimization tricks (e.g., faster exp approximation). Comparisons were made to Tri Dao’s prior work and MegaKernels, with users noting the significance of open-source contributions for understanding GPU kernel efficiency on Blackwell hardware.

2. **Debate Over Reverse Engineering Definitions**:  
   - A central debate revolved around whether **reading and analyzing source code** (like FA4’s) qualifies as reverse engineering. Some argued it’s merely “code summarization” unless dealing with binaries or undocumented systems. Others referenced formal definitions (e.g., IEEE’s) that include recovering design intent from existing code.  
   - Traditional reverse engineering was contrasted as involving **binary decompilation** or hardware analysis (e.g., recovering proprietary algorithms from executables). Examples like Quake’s fast inverse square root were cited as cases where code study revealed hidden optimizations, straddling the line between learning and reverse engineering.  

3. **Semantic Nuances**:  
   - Terms like “software archaeology” (recovering design artifacts) and “engineering” (deducing intent from code structure) were proposed to distinguish efforts.  
   - Some humorously likened reverse engineering to “Tolkien decoding Elvish,” emphasizing the interpretive challenge.  

4. **Challenges and Value**:  
   - Users acknowledged the difficulty of understanding complex code (e.g., CUDA kernels, assembly) without documentation, emphasizing the skill required to extract insights.  
   - Open-source FA4 was seen as a boon, enabling collaborative analysis and learning, while closed-source alternatives (like cuDNN) faced criticism for opacity.  

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion reflects a blend of admiration for FA4’s technical innovations and lively debate over terminology. While the FA4 analysis showcased GPU programming advancements, the community grappled with defining “reverse engineering”—ultimately agreeing that understanding code at a systemic level (even with source access) involves engineering rigor akin to traditional reverse processes.

### LLM Observability in the Wild – Why OpenTelemetry Should Be the Standard

#### [Submission URL](https://signoz.io/blog/llm-observability-opentelemetry/) | 127 points | by [pranay01](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pranay01) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398467)

Pranay Prateek (SigNoz) recaps a live chat with Chatwoot co-founder Pranav about a very real problem: once AI agents hit production, debugging gets hairy fast. Chatwoot’s cross-channel agent “Captain” occasionally replied in the wrong language or with off-base answers—and the team lacked end‑to‑end visibility into why.

What they needed was clear: see retrieved docs for RAG, tool calls, inputs/outputs at each step, and the decision path. But today’s observability options split along two imperfect standards:
- OpenTelemetry (OTel): battle-tested, multi-language, widely adopted—but designed for general apps with basic span kinds only.
- OpenInference (via tools like Phoenix): AI-native span types (LLM, tool, chain, agent), great filtering—but limited language support and weaker adherence to OTel semantic conventions.

In practice, this created friction. OpenAI’s native traces are rich but tightly coupled to OpenAI’s agent framework and don’t let you slice spans independently. New Relic (with OTel) worked but buried details behind too many clicks. Phoenix produced beautiful AI-centric traces, yet didn’t fully honor OTel semantics—so OTel spans showed up as “unknown”—and there’s no Ruby SDK, a blocker for Chatwoot’s Rails stack.

Prateek’s conclusion: pick one telemetry backbone and stick to it—preferably OpenTelemetry if the rest of your stack already speaks OTel. Enrich OTel spans with AI-specific attributes until GenAI semantic conventions mature, and keep any AI libraries as close to OTel as possible to avoid fragmented, siloed views. For teams, that means standardizing span names/attributes, mapping AI events to OTel, and resisting mixed standards that make production debugging harder, not easier.

The discussion around LLM observability using OpenTelemetry (OTel) vs. OpenInference (Phoenix) highlights several key debates and practical challenges:

### Core Themes:
1. **Observability Trade-offs**:
   - **OTel** is praised for its broad adoption, multi-language support, and compatibility with existing infrastructure (e.g., SigNoz, New Relic). However, it lacks native AI-specific semantics, requiring teams to enrich spans with custom attributes.
   - **OpenInference/Phoenix** offers AI-native features (e.g., LLM-specific span types, retrieval visualization) but faces criticism for incomplete OTel compliance (e.g., spans labeled as "unknown") and limited language support (e.g., no Ruby SDK).

2. **Semantic Conventions**:
   - Critics argue that Phoenix’s adherence to OTel is superficial—it uses OTel’s data format but ignores AI-specific semantic conventions, leading to poor UI rendering of spans in generalist tools like SigNoz. Proper semantic tagging (e.g., `llm_model`, `prompt`) is crucial for actionable insights but remains fragmented.

3. **Tooling Experiences**:
   - Users shared mixed experiences: Phoenix’s UI is lauded for AI-centric traces but called "clunky" compared to alternatives like **Langfuse**, which prioritizes developer experience and OTel integration.
   - Small startups highlighted frustration with setup complexity, while others emphasized the need for tools that balance experimentation (Phoenix) with production readiness (OTel-based stacks).

4. **Evaluation Challenges**:
   - Non-technical users writing 10-page prompts and dynamic routing introduce non-determinism, complicating debugging. Metrics like task completion rates, token costs, and error tracking are essential but hard to standardize.
   - Some equate LLM observability to "explainability," stressing the need to trace decision paths in black-box systems.

### Key Debates:
- **OTel vs. OpenInference**: While OTel is recommended as the backbone for teams already using it, hybrid approaches may be inevitable until GenAI semantic conventions mature.
- **Vendor Narratives**: Critics accused the article of conflating compatibility—Phoenix uses OpenInference specs, making it OTel-compatible only in data format, not semantics. This misalignment can silo data in AI-specific tools.
- **Cost vs. Value**: Adding monitoring infrastructure (e.g., tracing conversational flows) incurs overhead, but users agreed it’s critical for debugging stochastic LLM behaviors.

### Takeaways:
- Teams should standardize on **OTel** if possible, extending it with AI attributes, while pushing for mature semantic conventions.
- **Phoenix/Langfuse** are viable for AI-focused use cases but may require workarounds for integration. Developer experience and language support remain deciding factors.
- The discussion underscores the nascent state of LLM observability, balancing between generalist standards and domain-specific needs.

### GPT-OSS Reinforcement Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://docs.unsloth.ai/new/gpt-oss-reinforcement-learning) | 169 points | by [vinhnx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vinhnx) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45392744)

Unsloth adds RL fine‑tuning for OpenAI’s gpt-oss, claims big speed and memory wins

- What’s new: You can now train gpt-oss with reinforcement learning (GRPO and more) in Unsloth. They’ve rewritten Transformers inference for gpt-oss RL (since vLLM lacks BF16 and LoRA support here) and claim 3x faster generation, 50% less VRAM, and up to 8x longer context with no accuracy hit.

- Performance numbers: ~21 tokens/s in 4-bit RL mode; ~30 tokens/s in BF16, with significantly lower VRAM than other RL implementations. Works across GPUs from T4 to A100/H100.

- Long-context trick: Unsloth’s “Flex Attention” keeps O(N) memory and supports differentiable attention sinks needed for RL. They warn FlashAttention 3 currently breaks backprop for sinks (see FA3 issue 1797), so disabling FA3 elsewhere reverts to O(N^2); Flex Attention avoids that.

- 4-bit RL support: Unsloth says it’s the only framework offering 4-bit RL for gpt-oss. They also use weight sharing, custom kernels, and torch.compile “combo kernels” for speed.

- Hardware friendliness: A free Colab notebook fine-tunes gpt-oss-20b with GRPO on 15GB T4s. Embedding offloading saves ~1GB VRAM. gpt-oss-120b reportedly fits on 80GB GPUs.

- RL extras: The Colab auto-tunes matmul kernels, includes four new reward functions, and shows techniques to mitigate reward hacking.

- Roadmap: 50% weight-sharing for RL slated once vLLM adds compatible support.

Why it matters: If you want to do RL-style fine-tuning on gpt-oss without top-end hardware—or need long-context RL training—this promises practical speeds and memory use on commodity GPUs. As always, the headline gains are vendor benchmarks; FA3 caveats and implementation quirks (padding, sinks) apply.

The discussion around Unsloth's RL fine-tuning for GPT-OSS reveals several key themes:

### **Technical Praise & Innovation**
- Users commend Unsloth for enabling RL training on GPT-OSS with optimizations like Flex Attention and 4-bit support, addressing gaps in frameworks like vLLM. Performance claims (3x speed, 50% VRAM reduction) are highlighted as practical for commodity GPUs (e.g., T4 to A100).
- **Flex Attention** is noted for maintaining O(N) memory efficiency and supporting attention sinks critical for RL, avoiding pitfalls in FlashAttention 3. This enables long-context RL training without accuracy loss.

### **Skepticism & Debate**
- **RL Limitations**: Some argue RL fine-tuning risks catastrophic forgetting and may not outperform RAG/Agentic systems. Critics claim RL’s utility is niche (e.g., financial/legal strategy automation) and warn against overhyping its impact on general reasoning.
- **Decryption Claims**: A subthread debates RL’s potential for cryptographic breakthroughs. While Unsloth suggests RL could aid in "finding attack surfaces," skeptics dismiss breaking SHA-256/AES as unrealistic, emphasizing foundational math limits.

### **Model Performance & Benchmarks**
- **GPT-OSS vs. Competitors**: Users clash over benchmarks. GPT-OSS-120B ranks lower (#53 on LLM Arena) compared to DeepSeek V3 (#9) or Qwen-32B, but defenders argue GPT-OSS excels in enterprise reasoning and resource efficiency (e.g., fitting 120B on 80GB GPUs).
- **Architecture Debates**: Dense vs. MoE models are compared. GPT-OSS’s MoE design (3B active params) is praised for speed and memory efficiency, while Qwen’s dense 32B model is seen as computationally heavier but competitive in specific tasks.

### **Ethical & Practical Concerns**
- **Reward Hacking**: Unsloth’s notebook demonstrates mitigation techniques, but users stress the need for high-quality data to avoid model degradation.
- **Censorship & Use Cases**: Some note GPT-OSS’s popularity in uncensored enterprise applications, while others critique its performance in structured tasks (e.g., constrained JSON generation).

### **Final Takeaways**
- Unsloth’s work is seen as a significant technical leap for RL on GPT-OSS, enabling accessible fine-tuning with tangible speed/memory gains.
- Skepticism persists around RL’s broader applicability and ethical risks (e.g., decryption misuse), alongside debates about model benchmarking and architecture trade-offs.

### New in Firefox: Visual search powered by Google Lens

#### [Submission URL](https://connect.mozilla.org/t5/discussions/new-in-firefox-desktop-only-visual-search/m-p/106216#M41026) | 59 points | by [ReadCarlBarks](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ReadCarlBarks) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45398900)

Firefox is adding Google Lens-powered visual search on desktop

What’s new: Mozilla is rolling out a right‑click “Search Image with Google Lens” option in Firefox for desktop over the next few weeks. The menu item (initially tagged NEW) lets you:
- Find visually similar products, places, or objects
- Copy, translate, or search text inside images
- Get inspiration for travel, learning, or shopping

Details:
- Desktop-only at launch; gradual worldwide rollout
- Appears only if Google is set as the default search engine
- Mozilla is soliciting feedback on context‑menu placement, provider choice, and other entry points (new tab, address bar, mobile)

Community reaction: Mixed. Several users want this as an opt‑in extension and raise privacy concerns about sending images to Google, urging Mozilla to allow alternative visual search providers.

Controls and workarounds users highlighted:
- Early toggle: about:config → browser.search.visualSearch.featureGate (set true to try; availability may depend on rollout)
- Studies: some rollouts ship via Firefox studies; you can opt out of studies in settings
- Enterprise policy: admins report you can disable via policies.json with a VisualSearchEnabled flag (e.g., set to false), configurable via the Enterprise Policy Generator add‑on; applies to all profiles

Why it matters: Visual search is becoming a baseline browser feature. Mozilla’s choice to integrate Google Lens prioritizes capability and familiarity, but the pushback underscores demand for privacy controls and provider choice.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The integration of Google Lens into Firefox sparked debate, with reactions split between appreciation for utility and concerns over privacy and Mozilla’s reliance on Google. Key themes:

### **Privacy Concerns**
- Users criticized Mozilla for deepening ties with Google, arguing it undermines Firefox’s independence. Comments like "*Don’t like Google… clear move [for] Google money*" reflect skepticism about Mozilla’s funding model.
- Sending images to Google raises privacy red flags. Critics urged Mozilla to allow alternative providers (e.g., Microsoft, OpenAI) or open the feature to extensions.

### **Alternatives & Extensions**
- **SearXNG** was recommended as a privacy-focused, self-hostable metasearch engine that aggregates results without tracking.
- Users highlighted existing Firefox extensions like **[Search by Image](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search_by_image/)** and **[Image Search](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-)** for multi-engine visual searches without Google integration.
- **LibreWolf** (a privacy-focused Firefox fork) and **Arkenfox** user.js were suggested for users seeking hardened defaults.

### **Technical Workarounds**
- Disabling the feature: Toggle `browser.search.visualSearch.featureGate` in `about:config`, opt out of Firefox Studies, or use enterprise policies (`VisualSearchEnabled` flag).
- Some noted the feature only appears if Google is the default search engine, prompting users to switch providers.

### **Criticism of Mozilla’s Decisions**
- Frustration over non-optional features: "*Should be an opt-in extension*" echoed widely. Users argued Mozilla should prioritize extensibility over bundling Google tools.
- Skepticism about Mozilla’s leadership: A misplaced reference to Brendan Eich was corrected, shifting blame to CEO Mitchell Baker for perceived declines in principled decision-making.

### **Feature Appreciation**
- Supporters praised Google Lens’s utility for translating text in images, identifying objects/plants, and shopping. One user shared: "*I use Lens multiple times a day… it’s pretty amazing.*"
- Some viewed the integration as catching Firefox up to Chrome’s existing visual-search capabilities.

**Takeaway**: While the feature’s practicality is acknowledged, the backlash underscores a vocal demand for privacy-first defaults, provider choice, and Mozilla’s need to reconcile its Google partnership with its privacy-centric ethos.
