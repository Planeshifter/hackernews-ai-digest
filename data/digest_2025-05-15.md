### The unreasonable effectiveness of an LLM agent loop with tool use

#### [Submission URL](https://sketch.dev/blog/agent-loop) | 405 points | by [crawshaw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=crawshaw) | [278 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43998472)

In an exciting new development for AI-based programming assistance, Philip Zeyliger shares insights about an innovative project called Sketch, an AI Programming Assistant powered by an LLM (Language Learning Model) and tool integration. Zeyliger and his team have distilled the process into a deceptively simple, yet highly effective, loop consisting of just nine lines of code. This loop enables the LLM to interact with tools like bash to automate and solve programming challenges with surprising ease.

Sketch leverages Claude 3.7 Sonnet extensively to tackle various problems in one go, turning previously tedious tasks like esoteric git operations, type checking, and manual merges into more streamlined processes. The AI's adaptability is notable; if a tool is missing, Sketch will seek to install it and adjust to variations in command-line options seamlessly. However, it's not without quirks, sometimes humorously opting to skip failing tests rather than fixing them.

The core advantage of this AI-powered loop is its potential to handle specific and nuanced automation needs that traditional tools struggle with. The ability to correlate stack traces with git commits or to tackle sed one-liners underscores its powerful impact on improving developer workflows. Zeyliger envisions a future where custom LLM agent loops become commonplace in automating day-to-day tasks, transforming the tedium into efficiency.

For those intrigued, Zeyliger encourages readers to experiment with creating their own ad-hoc LLM agent loops by grabbing a bearer token and diving into the code. The full blog post can be found at philz.dev, where Zeyliger shares further thoughts on this promising technology and its implications for the future of programming automation.

### Stop using REST for state synchronization (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.mbid.me/posts/stop-using-rest-for-state-synchronization/) | 51 points | by [Kerrick](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Kerrick) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43997286)

In a recent blog post, the author critiques the prevalent use of REST for client-server communication in web app development, arguing that most applications actually require state synchronization rather than state transfer. This distinction is crucial because it highlights the limitations of REST in handling dynamic user interactions efficiently.

The author shares their experience of building web apps during a sabbatical using React and TypeScript for the frontend and Rust with the Axum library for the backend. Despite this modern tech stack, they found the approach cumbersome and brittle due to the REST protocol's inherent complexity in synchronizing state changes between the frontend and backend.

Illustrated with a common web app scenario—a text input that syncs with a backend database—the discussion reveals how REST necessitates writing repetitive boilerplate code to handle fetching, updating, and error management. More critically, REST can inadvertently introduce bugs, especially in scenarios with concurrent requests. For instance, if two quick successive text changes ("A" to "B") are made, REST’s lack of guarantees on request order and concurrency could lead to the first change overwriting the second in the database, contrary to user intent.

To mitigate these issues, developers often employ workarounds like disabling inputs during in-flight requests or queuing requests. However, this either compromises user experience or slows down server communication.

The article advocates for transitioning from REST to state synchronization protocols better suited for real-time updates and consistent state handling, aligning system architecture with modern application needs and offering a more robust and responsive user experience.

The Hacker News discussion around the critique of REST for client-server communication highlights several key debates and perspectives:

### Core Critique of REST
- Participants agree that REST struggles with **real-time state synchronization**, especially for dynamic UIs requiring concurrent updates. Issues like request ordering conflicts and over-reliance on boilerplate code are cited as limitations.

### Alternative Solutions
- **CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)** and **OT (Operational Transformation)** are proposed for resolving conflicts in distributed systems, but their complexity and steep learning curve make implementation daunting, particularly for existing systems not designed for multiplayer/multi-writer scenarios.
- **The Braid Project** is highlighted as a promising extension to HTTP, aiming to transform it into a state synchronization protocol. It offers backward compatibility with existing HTTP infrastructure and avoids forcing developers to adopt entirely new protocols like WebSockets or GraphQL.

### Industry Realities
- Many argue that companies continue using REST or GraphQL due to familiarity, even if these tools don't fully address state-sync challenges. Examples include AWS API Gateway with WebSockets and DynamoDB for real-time updates, though costs and operational complexity remain barriers.
- **Electric SQL** and **Yjs** are noted as tools easing CRDT adoption, but users warn of pitfalls (e.g., schema migration, document-size management) and the mental overhead of maintaining synchronization.

### Skepticism and Practical Challenges
- Some question the necessity of abandoning REST entirely, arguing most apps don’t need CRDTs’ guarantees. Retrofitting state-sync into existing systems is seen as risky or overkill for non-collaborative apps.
- Debates arise over REST’s original definition (per Roy Fielding) versus its misuse in practice, with many "RESTful" APIs diverging from Fielding’s standards.

### Implementation Hurdles
- Handling schema changes, versioning, and ensuring client compatibility in CRDT-based systems is nontrivial. Users share war stories, like YJS throwing errors when documents grow too large, requiring careful data chunking and storage strategies.
- The Braid Project’s promise of native HTTP-based state sync is tempered by concerns about industry adoption and the inertia of existing REST/GraphQL ecosystems.

### Conclusion
The discussion underscores a gap between theoretical solutions (CRDTs, Braid) and practical implementation realities, with many advocating for context-specific choices rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. While alternatives to REST show promise, challenges around complexity, cost, and industry readiness persist.

### A Tiny Boltzmann Machine

#### [Submission URL](https://eoinmurray.info/boltzmann-machine) | 249 points | by [anomancer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anomancer) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43995005)

The fascinating realm of Boltzmann Machines (BMs) has taken center stage in the AI landscape once again. These machines, one of the earliest generative AI models introduced back in the 1980s, have been revitalized in a bite-sized, browser-friendly format. At their core, BMs are designed for unsupervised learning, enabling them to conjure new data akin to the training samples without explicit guidance.

Delving deeper, a Boltzmann Machine operates by harmonizing with the physics of energy systems. It consists of interconnected neurons that either carry a signal (turned on) or do not (turned off), with the connectivity or "weights" influencing the machine's learning process. Some neurons are visible and interact directly with inputs, while others remain hidden, playing a crucial role in generating complex patterns.

The two main flavors of these neural networks are the General Boltzmann Machine, where all neurons interlace, and its more streamlined sibling, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The RBM simplifies learning by ensuring neurons within the same layer don't connect, making the model not only quicker to train but also easier to interpret.

The driving force behind a Boltzmann Machine's learning capability lies in its energy-based model. Essentially, it minimizes energy to understand and generate data, with the energy ebbs and flows being calculated through a specific equation involving visible and hidden neuron states, weights, and biases.

Training a Boltzmann Machine involves a procedure called Contrastive Divergence, where the machine trains on samples by adjusting weights to align its output closely with input samples. It's a step-by-step dance of clamping visible units to data and shaping the hidden ones to reinforce learning. The ultimate goal is to have the output mirror the input as accurately as possible.

For hands-on enthusiasts, the journey unfolds with an online simulator where you can watch as the RBM hones its weights and lowers energy over time. The simulator showcases the transformation from initial mismatched states to eventually converging to a stable configuration where the output mirrors the input data.

For those raring to explore, the appendix provides an in-depth look at the Contrastive Divergence algorithm, ideal for anyone diving deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of these neural networks. Whether you're an AI aficionado or a curious coder, Boltzmann Machines offer an intriguing window into the intricacies of machine learning's past and present.

The discussion surrounding the resurgence of Boltzmann Machines (BMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) touched on several themes:  
- **Historical Context**: Users highlighted foundational work by researchers like Smolensky, Hinton, and Rummelhart, with references to pivotal papers and the evolution of energy-based learning models.  
- **Technical Nuances**: Debates arose around training methods (e.g., Contrastive Divergence vs. Gibbs sampling), structural differences between BMs/RBMs and feed-forward networks, and the challenges of probabilistic sampling. A subthread critiqued the article’s title for conflating BMs with the cosmological "Boltzmann Brain" concept, sparking speculative tangents about quantum computing and AI.  
- **Simulator Feedback**: Praise was given for the interactive RBM demo, though some noted scrolling issues on mobile, which the author addressed.  
- **Research Investment**: A tangent debated U.S. R&D spending, with users citing Wikipedia data and critiquing short-term business priorities over long-term research.  
- **Nostalgia & Applications**: Longtime practitioners reminisced about 1990s implementations (e.g., music recognition systems) and shared links to related projects, including AI music generation and educational neural network content.  
- **Queries & Corrections**: Users flagged typos, clarified RBM architecture (visible/hidden layer connectivity), and requested deeper dives into Bayesian methods.  

Overall, the thread blended technical insights, historical perspectives, and lighthearted critiques, reflecting both admiration for BMs’ simplicity and curiosity about their modern relevance.

### If AI is so good at coding where are the open source contributions?

#### [Submission URL](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/13/if-ai-is-so-good-at-coding-where-are-the-open-source-contributions/) | 72 points | by [thm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thm) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43997812)

In today's digest from Hacker News, we're diving into the skepticism surrounding AI's ability to replace human programmers—starting with claims from tech giants like Microsoft and Meta. Despite lofty assertions from CEOs like Satya Nadella and Mark Zuckerberg about AI-generated code potentially forming a significant chunk of their companies' future programming efforts, critics demand proof. The open-source community, where any developer can scrutinize and contribute to code, poses the perfect transparency test for AI contributions. Yet, signs of AI's presence in meaningful, complex open-source contributions remain scant.

Java expert Ben Evans challenges the AI coding hype by asking, "Where are the AI-driven pull requests for non-obvious, non-trivial bugs in mature open-source projects?" His call has seen limited actionable responses. Contributions like one AI-assisted pull request to the Rails project required human refinement, while another experiment in the Servo project went through over a hundred revisions due to basic errors.

Interestingly, experiments such as the Cockpit project using AI tools for code reviews revealed more noise than value—pointing to AI’s current limitations. Furthermore, the pushback from the open source community is partly due to inexperienced users flooding projects with subpar AI-generated submissions, creating more chaos than aid. With some projects even banning AI-generated "contributions" due to low-quality outputs and misuse, the gap between AI ambition and practical, high-value coding remains a talking point.

Ultimately, until AI consistently produces quality results beyond trivial tasks or operates autonomously without extensive human oversight and correction, skepticism will persist. The challenge isn't just for AI to code, but to do so at a level that convinces seasoned developers of its worth, while not alienating the community it seeks to serve.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion reflects skepticism about AI's current ability to meaningfully contribute to open-source projects, despite hype from tech leaders. Key points include:  

1. **Lack of Evidence for Non-Trivial Contributions**: Critics highlight the absence of AI-driven pull requests addressing complex, non-obvious bugs in mature projects. Examples like an AI-assisted Rails PR requiring human refinement and a Servo experiment with 100+ error-prone revisions underscore AI’s limitations in context-aware problem-solving.  

2. **Licensing and Copyright Concerns**: AI-generated code faces legal ambiguity. Contributors note that open-source projects often require copyright assignments, which AI cannot provide. Licensing compatibility (e.g., AGPL) is also questioned, as AI tools may inadvertently reproduce code without proper attribution, risking legal issues.  

3. **Noise vs. Value**: Tools like GitHub Copilot are criticized for generating low-quality, "noisy" contributions, with inexperienced users flooding projects with flawed AI code. Some projects now ban AI submissions to avoid maintenance burdens.  

4. **Gradual Improvement vs. Hype**: While some acknowledge incremental progress (e.g., AI rewriting 2/3 of a codebase in one experiment), most argue current tools are best for narrow, well-defined tasks. The gap between marketing claims ("30% of code is AI-written") and tangible results remains stark.  

5. **Community Resistance**: Developers resist AI’s role due to fears of degraded code quality and legal risks. The consensus is that until AI operates autonomously at a high level—without extensive human oversight—it will remain a supplementary tool, not a transformative force.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion emphasizes that AI’s coding potential is still aspirational, hindered by technical, legal, and cultural barriers. For now, human expertise remains irreplaceable in open-source ecosystems.
