Researchers from the Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago and Adobe have developed a groundbreaking approach called INTRINSIC LoRA (I-LoRA) that delves into the hidden capabilities of generative models such as VQGAN, StyleGAN-XL, StyleGAN-v2, and Stable Diffusion. By modulating key feature maps, the I-LoRA method can extract intrinsic scene properties like normals, depth, albedo, and shading, showcasing the deep understanding these models have of scene intrinsics. 

The study sheds light on how generative models can synthesize highly detailed and realistic images, hinting at their ability to implicitly capture image intrinsics. Surprisingly, the research reveals that these models can internally produce top-quality scene intrinsic maps without the need for additional decoders or extensive fine-tuning.

Through a Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) technique that involves tweaking less than 0.6% of the total model parameters, I-LoRA can adapt to various generative architectures with just a small set of labeled images. The results show that the intrinsic scene maps generated using I-LoRA match or even surpass those from leading supervised techniques, even across different generative models, without altering the original generator head.

This innovative method has the potential to unlock new possibilities and applications for generative models, opening up the door to a deeper exploration of their inherent understanding of scene intrinsics.

### Developer just open sourced tool that could bring an end to Nvidia's AI hegemony

#### [Submission URL](https://www.techradar.com/pro/a-lone-developer-just-open-sourced-a-tool-that-could-bring-an-end-to-nvidias-ai-hegemony-amd-financed-it-for-months-but-abruptly-ended-its-support-nobody-knows-why) | 24 points | by [rmason](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rmason) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39486381)

The developer behind ZLUDA, a tool allowing Nvidia's CUDA code to run on AMD and Intel GPUs without modifications, has open-sourced the project after losing support from both AMD and Intel. Originally developed in 2020 to enable Intel GPUs to run CUDA, the tool has since been revamped and now only supports AMD Radeon GPUs based on the ROCm solution. Despite its potential, both Intel and AMD have decided not to pursue compatibility with the CUDA ecosystem, favoring their own solutions. While ZLUDA has shown promise, it is not a foolproof solution, lacking full support for features like NVIDIA OptiX. The sudden discontinuation of support by AMD remains a mystery, possibly to avoid legal issues. Nonetheless, ZLUDA continues to offer a glimmer of hope for running CUDA software on alternative GPU architectures.

- **KuriousCat** commented that things don't add up regarding AMD killing the project, as the benefits of supporting AI specific needs are overwhelming, suggesting a violation of legal terms with Nvidia.
- **pxlpt** responded by pointing out that despite AMD's quarterly funding of ZLUDA in the past years, the company decided to discontinue support for the project for unknown reasons. The decision seems to be related to the lowest pulled contract and a lack of funding that couldn't be directly tied to the project.
- **FloatArtifact** mentioned that bridging AMD's current state to improving stock or worst developers while developing native compatibility is an impressive project with limitations in compatibility.
- **thygtt** expressed agreement with the discussion.

### Nvidia open source driver to use NVK and Zink for OpenGL on newer GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2024/02/nvidia-open-source-driver-to-use-nvk-zink-for-opengl-on-newer-gpus/) | 39 points | by [mfilion](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfilion) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39484866)

In recent news on Hacker News, there's a fascinating development in the open-source driver world for NVIDIA GPUs. A merge request on the Mesa Git repository has added initial support for using Zink as a translation layer to handle OpenGL tasks. This move allows owners of newer NVIDIA GPUs, specifically GeForce RTX 20xx series and above, to opt for Zink over the default NVC0 Gallium3D implementation. By leveraging Zink, OpenGL can be supported through a generic implementation, simplifying maintenance and potentially boosting performance.

If you're keen to try this out, it may involve setting an environment variable after updating to Mesa 24.1. However, as this feature is still on the main branch of the Mesa repository, many distributions might not have incorporated these changes yet. For those on source-based distros or using package building systems like AUR, tracking the main branch through mesa-git can offer access to these bleeding-edge features. While this technology is still in progress, recent developments have shown promising improvements, with developer Mike Blumenkrantz noting that all GL games now run on NVK.

The community's response has been mixed, with some expressing relief at the evolving options for NVIDIA GPUs and the potential for open-source drivers. Others highlight the benefits of streamlining maintenance through Zink and the performance enhancements it could bring. Amidst discussions on market trends, open-source advocacy, and support for GamingOnLinux, the conversation showcases a blend of excitement, skepticism, and hope for the future of GPU drivers.

The discussion is centered around the implementation of power management support in NVIDIA GPUs from 2018-2019 and its impact on heavy GPU applications. There is a comparison made to RISC-V for power management delegation and the shift in handling GPU drivers. Some express disappointment in the lack of definitive support for newer GPUs like the RTX 20 series, while others are hopeful for the future and potential paths forward with the latest NVIDIA drivers.

Additionally, there is mention of NVK in relation to the topic. There is optimism that NVIDIA GPUs can potentially replace Nvidias with the combination of NVK and Zink. Some users also suggest that AI could play a role in tackling this issue. The conversation reflects a mix of perspectives on the current state and future possibilities for NVIDIA GPU support on Linux.

### Jim Keller criticizes Nvidia's CUDA, x86

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/jim-keller-criticizes-nvidias-cuda-and-x86-cudas-a-swamp-not-a-moat-x86-was-a-swamp-too) | 193 points | by [flykespice](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=flykespice) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39480341)

In a recent critique, legendary processor architect Jim Keller shared his thoughts on Nvidia's CUDA architecture, comparing it to the complex evolution of x86 processors. Keller highlighted that CUDA, much like x86, has grown incrementally to maintain backward compatibility, resulting in a platform that is comprehensive but may hamper performance and development ease. Despite its widespread use, Keller noted that many developers opt for more efficient open-source frameworks over CUDA for accelerated computing tasks.

Moreover, Keller emphasized that Nvidia offers alternative tools like Triton Inference Server and TensorRT, which optimize AI model deployment and accelerate deep learning inference on GPUs. While platforms like x86, Arm, and CUDA face criticisms for their intricate evolution and compatibility constraints, they provide stability and cohesion, unlike more fragmented frameworks like GPGPU.

Although Keller did not express his views on AMD's ROCm or Intel's OneAPI, his remarks suggest a skepticism towards the future of x86. As a seasoned architect with experience at major chipmakers, Keller's insights shed light on the challenges and opportunities within the processor architecture landscape. While his stance on Nvidia's technology remains critical, Keller's contributions and perspectives continue to influence the industry, raising questions about the trajectory of modern computing platforms.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the thoughts shared by Jim Keller regarding Nvidia's CUDA architecture and alternative tools like Triton Inference Server and TensorRT. One user points out that Jim Keller works at Tenstorrent - a direct competitor of Nvidia. The conversation touches upon the differences between Nvidia and Tenstorrent in terms of philosophy and design. Additionally, there are comments discussing Keller's philosophy as outlined in a YouTube video, emphasizing the importance of theory, craftsmanship, and experimentation in computer science progress. Moreover, there are mentions of Keller's experience at various chipmakers and insights into managing company directions.
