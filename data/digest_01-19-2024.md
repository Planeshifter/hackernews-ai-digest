### Calculus on Computational Graphs: Backpropagation (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) | 161 points | by [throwup238](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwup238) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39057461)

In this post from August 31, 2015, the author gives an introduction to backpropagation, the algorithm that makes training deep models computationally tractable. They explain how backpropagation can make training with gradient descent up to ten million times faster, and how it is a powerful tool in many areas. The author then introduces computational graphs as a way to think about mathematical expressions, using the expression \(e=(a+b)*(b+1)\) as an example. They explain how to evaluate the expression using computational graphs and how to calculate derivatives on these graphs. They discuss the sum rule and the product rule, as well as how to calculate derivatives for nodes that aren't directly connected. The author then explains the problem with just "summing over the paths" and introduces forward-mode differentiation and reverse-mode differentiation as algorithms for efficiently computing the sum by factoring the paths. They compare the two algorithms and explain how reverse-mode differentiation tracks how every node affects one output. The post ends by discussing the importance of reverse-mode differentiation in computational victories.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission includes various comments and conversations. Here are some key points discussed:

- One user shared a link to a paper by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard, providing additional information on backpropagation.
- Another user shared a link to Andrej Karpathy's YouTube video on backpropagation in neural networks.

### Will Japan see more marriages with Tokyo's taxpayer-funded AI-driven dating app?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3248989/will-japan-see-more-marriages-tokyos-taxpayer-funded-ai-driven-dating-app-or-it-just-throwing-money) | 39 points | by [ulrischa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ulrischa) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39060790)

The Tokyo metropolitan government is launching an AI-driven dating app called Tokyo Futari Story, aimed at helping single residents find their life partners. The app has a stringent registration process that includes verifying users' salaries and single status, and pairs them up based on shared values using AI technology. The need for such a service is evident, as a large percentage of men and women in Tokyo have never been married. However, critics argue that the app is not a solution to the underlying reasons why people are not getting married and having children, such as financial constraints. They suggest that the government should address these fundamental issues instead of funding a dating app. While some welcome the initiative, others believe it is unnecessary, as there are already many dating sites available. The app is set to go live in the spring.

The discussion on this submission revolves around several key points. 
1. The high cost of housing in Tokyo and its impact on the affordability of living, particularly for young professionals and families. The exorbitant rental prices and the lack of affordable housing options are seen as major hurdles to getting married and having children. The cost of living in Tokyo is compared to other cities, such as Sydney, to highlight the discrepancy.
2. The cultural and societal factors influencing the decline in marriage and birth rates. Some comments suggest that financial constraints are not the sole reasons for people delaying or avoiding marriage. The preference for remaining single, concerns about financial stability, and the pressure to provide documentation that verifies annual income are cited as factors contributing to the decline in marriages and births.
3. The lack of social security and support for raising children is seen as a significant issue, further discouraging people from starting families. The absence of reliable birth control methods in the past and the prevalence of child labor in older generations are also mentioned as reasons for the lower birth rate.
4. The discussion touches on the need to address the underlying socio-economic problems and provide better work-life balance instead of funding dating apps. Some argue that the government should focus on making housing more affordable and improving social security for families, rather than attempting to solve the issue through dating apps.

Overall, the comments reflect a nuanced understanding of the complex factors contributing to the decline in marriage and birth rates in Tokyo, including societal expectations, financial constraints, and the lack of support for raising families. There is a general consensus that addressing these underlying issues is crucial in finding a solution.
