#### [Submission URL](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop/) | 161 points | by [throwup238](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwup238) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39057461)

In this post from August 31, 2015, the author gives an introduction to backpropagation, the algorithm that makes training deep models computationally tractable. They explain how backpropagation can make training with gradient descent up to ten million times faster, and how it is a powerful tool in many areas. The author then introduces computational graphs as a way to think about mathematical expressions, using the expression \(e=(a+b)*(b+1)\) as an example. They explain how to evaluate the expression using computational graphs and how to calculate derivatives on these graphs. They discuss the sum rule and the product rule, as well as how to calculate derivatives for nodes that aren't directly connected. The author then explains the problem with just "summing over the paths" and introduces forward-mode differentiation and reverse-mode differentiation as algorithms for efficiently computing the sum by factoring the paths. They compare the two algorithms and explain how reverse-mode differentiation tracks how every node affects one output. The post ends by discussing the importance of reverse-mode differentiation in computational victories.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission includes various comments and conversations. Here are some key points discussed:

- One user shared a link to a paper by Terence Parr and Jeremy Howard, providing additional information on backpropagation.

As technology continues to advance, the future of skin cancer detection looks promising, and DermaSensor sets the stage for further innovations in AI-powered medical devices.

The discussion on Hacker News about this submission revolves around several key points.

One user points out that the marketing of the device contradicts the FDA's clarification, stating that the device is essentially meant to help physicians suspect abnormal lesions rather than provide a definitive diagnosis. They express skepticism that the device would be trusted by physicians and suggest that a primary care physician would refer patients to a specialist instead.

Another user comments that this seems like a paid subscription model, questioning the pricing structure of $199/month for patients and $399/month for unlimited use. They find it absurd and criticize the medical industry for such practices.

There is also a discussion about the accuracy of AI-powered skin cancer detection. Some users suggest that there are existing phone apps with high accuracy, while others argue that factors like image resolution, lighting, and skin pigmentation can affect accuracy. One user mentions a study that showed iPhone apps detecting skin cancers with 95% accuracy in 2020.

Another user raises concerns about the potential for false positive rates and the healthcare system's ability to handle the influx of unnecessary tests and follow-ups. They argue that frequent incorrect checks could create unnecessary costs and backlogs.

The discussion also touches on the cost of medical technology and the use of outdated operating systems. One user points out the high cost of digital X-ray machines and the need for software updates, while another mentions the use of Windows XP in some medical devices, highlighting the importance of security and compatibility.

### Will Japan see more marriages with Tokyo's taxpayer-funded AI-driven dating app?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/people/article/3248989/will-japan-see-more-marriages-tokyos-taxpayer-funded-ai-driven-dating-app-or-it-just-throwing-money) | 39 points | by [ulrischa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ulrischa) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39060790)

The Tokyo metropolitan government is launching an AI-driven dating app called Tokyo Futari Story, aimed at helping single residents find their life partners. The app has a stringent registration process that includes verifying users' salaries and single status, and pairs them up based on shared values using AI technology. The need for such a service is evident, as a large percentage of men and women in Tokyo have never been married. However, critics argue that the app is not a solution to the underlying reasons why people are not getting married and having children, such as financial constraints. They suggest that the government should address these fundamental issues instead of funding a dating app. While some welcome the initiative, others believe it is unnecessary, as there are already many dating sites available. The app is set to go live in the spring.

The discussion on this submission revolves around several key points. 

1. The high cost of housing in Tokyo and its impact on the affordability of living, particularly for young professionals and families. The exorbitant rental prices and the lack of affordable housing options are seen as major hurdles to getting married and having children. The cost of living in Tokyo is compared to other cities, such as Sydney, to highlight the discrepancy.

2. The cultural and societal factors influencing the decline in marriage and birth rates. Some comments suggest that financial constraints are not the sole reasons for people delaying or avoiding marriage. The preference for remaining single, concerns about financial stability, and the pressure to provide documentation that verifies annual income are cited as factors contributing to the decline in marriages and births.

3. The lack of social security and support for raising children is seen as a significant issue, further discouraging people from starting families. The absence of reliable birth control methods in the past and the prevalence of child labor in older generations are also mentioned as reasons for the lower birth rate.

4. The discussion touches on the need to address the underlying socio-economic problems and provide better work-life balance instead of funding dating apps. Some argue that the government should focus on making housing more affordable and improving social security for families, rather than attempting to solve the issue through dating apps.

Overall, the comments reflect a nuanced understanding of the complex factors contributing to the decline in marriage and birth rates in Tokyo, including societal expectations, financial constraints, and the lack of support for raising families. There is a general consensus that addressing these underlying issues is crucial in finding a solution.

Welcome to the Hacker News Daily Digest, where we bring you the top stories from the tech world straight to your screen. Today, we have an exciting submission that caught our attention.

ðŸš€ SpaceX Successfully Launches Starship Prototype SN10 ðŸš€

In a big win for SpaceX and space enthusiasts everywhere, the aerospace company achieved yet another milestone in their journey toward interplanetary travel. The Starship prototype SN10 took to the skies with a successful launch and landing. It soared to an altitude of roughly 10 kilometers before executing an impressive belly flop maneuver, reorienting itself, and finally touching down gracefully on the launch pad.

SpaceX's goal with the Starship program is to develop a fully reusable spacecraft capable of carrying humans and cargo to destinations like the Moon, Mars, and beyond. SN10's successful flight and landing bring them one step closer to that vision. It's worth noting that while SN8 and SN9, the previous prototypes, had rough landings resulting in spectacular explosions, the SN10 managed to stand tall.

With each successful iteration, SpaceX continues to refine its technology and push the boundaries of what is possible in space exploration. This achievement bodes well for the company's upcoming missions, including an eventual crewed flight to the Moon with Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa and the dearMoon project.

SpaceX's persistent drive to innovate and overcome challenges is inspiring, to say the least. We can't help but eagerly await their next launch, where they will undoubtedly push the boundaries even further. Stay tuned for more future-looking tech stories right here on the Hacker News Daily Digest!

The discussion surrounding the submission began with a comment pointing out a YouTube video about a machine that can process and recycle lemon waste efficiently. Another user found it amusing and jokingly mentioned that Apple might be surprised because they are known for wasteful design.
