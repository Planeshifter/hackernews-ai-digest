### Does the Bitter Lesson Have Limits?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/08/01/does-the-bitter-lesson-have-limits.html) | 165 points | by [dbreunig](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbreunig) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44762022)

The “Bitter Lesson” coined by AI researcher Rich Sutton, suggests that general methods leveraging computation trump human-centric approaches in the long term success of technology advancements. But why is this approach considered bitter? According to Sutton, the success comes at the cost of going against our preferred human-centric methods, which initially deliver personal satisfaction and short-term success but plateau over time. Historical lessons from fields like computer chess, Go, and speech recognition demonstrate that it’s the scaling of computation and learning, rather than built-in knowledge, that propels significant breakthroughs.

This concept echoes Donna Haraway's theories on the ‘blows to the human ego’—realizations that unsettle human dominance, like Copernicus’s heliocentrism or Darwin’s evolution. In this light, AI’s capabilities challenge yet another facet of human centrality, suggesting that perhaps humans aren't as pivotal in creative processes as once believed—a notion resonated by Neil deGrasse Tyson’s thinking.

Ethan Mollick explores this further by contrasting Sutton's bitter lesson with the "Garbage Can Model" of organizational theory, highlighting how organizations often operate in chaos rather than planned methods. Organizations are messy and unpredictable compared to fields like chess or Go where the “win” conditions are clear. Mollick proposes that for AI to thrive in such a chaotic environment, organizations must adequately define quality and provide ample real-world data examples—no easy feat given the reductionist nature of data and the often vague objectives of organizations.

This resurfacing of the bitter lesson is met with skepticism revolving around the quality and clarity of data required in complex environments like businesses. Unlike games where objectives are clear and data is rich, organizational processes are often undocumented and multilayered, making AI adaptation challenging. Metrics, often used to measure objectives, can reduce complex ideas to simplistic data points, leading to potential manipulation or misinterpretation.

In essence, the Bitter Lesson serves as a reflection point on the limitations and possibilities of AI, urging us to reconsider how we define and measure success in the world of technology—a world where being human may no longer hold the central significance it once did.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on Rich Sutton’s *Bitter Lesson* and Ethan Mollick’s *Garbage Can Model* explores nuanced perspectives and critiques of AI's reliance on computational scaling versus human-centric methods. Key points include:

1. **Technical Debates on Efficiency**:  
   - Users discussed applications like autonomous drones using small neural networks (MLPs) to bypass traditional control theory (e.g., Model Predictive Control). While scalable, critics noted limitations in scenarios requiring physical insights or sensor-data interpretation, where classical methods excel. Anomaly detection research was flagged as potentially misleading, with simple classical techniques (e.g., FFT-based analysis) sometimes outperforming deep learning despite claims to the contrary.

2. **Challenges in Organizational Contexts**:  
   - Skepticism emerged about applying AI to chaotic environments (per the Garbage Can Model). Unlike structured domains (chess, Go), organizations lack clear objectives and data quality, risking reductionist metrics that misrepresent complex goals. Users highlighted cases where ML solutions failed due to undocumented processes or the inability to translate vague objectives into training data.

3. **Hybrid Approaches in Robotics and AI**:  
   - Historical debates resurfaced on merging reactive and deliberative control architectures in robotics. Modern systems, like Stockfish (chess) combining neural networks with search algorithms, illustrate hybrid success. However, concerns arose about mainstream AI’s trajectory, particularly LLMs and AGI speculation, fearing over-reliance on "test-time compute" might sideline fundamental engineering.

4. **Hardware and Financial Limits**:  
   - Users questioned whether computational scaling faces inevitable bottlenecks, citing semiconductor manufacturing’s rising costs (e.g., ASML’s EUV lithography challenges). This contrasts Sutton’s optimism, suggesting financial or physical constraints might disrupt the Bitter Lesson’s assumption of infinite scaling.

5. **Tension Between Paradigms**:  
   - While Sutton’s lesson emphasizes general methods, comments argued for context-aware hybrid models. Examples included vibration analysis in SaaS products, where ML supplements (but doesn’t replace) domain expertise, and molecular dynamics simulations using neural networks to approximate expensive calculations.

**Conclusion**:  
The discussion paints the Bitter Lesson as a valuable heuristic but stresses its limitations in messy, real-world contexts. Hybrid models, contextual awareness, and data quality are critical, while hardware and financial realities may temper unchecked computational optimism. The broader takeaway: AI’s evolution hinges on balancing scalable methods with domain-specific insights, avoiding oversimplification of complex problems.

### The AI age is the "age of no consent"

#### [Submission URL](https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/the-ai-age-is-the-age-of-no-consent-7559) | 74 points | by [BallsInIt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BallsInIt) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44759904)

In the thought-provoking article "The AI Age is the 'Age of No Consent'," author Pavel Samsonov delves deep into the unsettling transformation brought on by AI technology—where user consent and needs take a backseat to the supposed "inevitability" of AI-driven design. Samsonov paints a compelling picture of how product managers and designers have increasingly replaced genuine user feedback with AI tools like GPT, leading to an environment where technology, not human needs, dictates the narrative.

The paradox highlighted is stark: while AI tools claim to enhance user experience, they effectively diminish user agency. Rather than serving as instruments of empowerment, they warp the user experience to fit predefined AI-centric outcomes. Samsonov critiques this shift, emphasizing that AI has made it so users are no longer given the choice to opt out; instead, AI's omnipresence forces engagement, subtly embedding itself into all facets of life. Even more concerning is the ethical dilemma posed by AI's reliance on vast troves of data, often scraped without consent or compensation, effectively disregarding intellectual property rights and user autonomy.

The article points out AI's subtle yet pervasive influence, infiltrating decisions and outputs in daily life without explicit permission. Despite the illusion of merely being a tool, AI systems are embedded with biases and logics that steer users' actions, often skewing towards surveillance and control rather than empowerment and freedom.

This exposé calls for a reconciliation of technological development with ethical responsibility, pleading for a return to a time where user needs and consent dictate design, urging stakeholders to rethink the trajectory of AI's role in our lives imminently.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around ethical and societal concerns regarding AI's growing influence, emphasizing themes of consent, data exploitation, and systemic inequality. Key points include:

1. **Consent & Data Ethics**:  
   - Criticisms target AI companies for bypassing user consent, referencing scandals like **Cambridge Analytica** and the scraping of data/IP without permission. Users liken data commodification to a loss of freedom, with one noting the irony that "information wants to be free" yet is increasingly controlled by corporations.

2. **Social Inequality & Class Divides**:  
   - Debates touch on wealth accumulation, **social Darwinism**, and historical parallels (e.g., the **French Revolution**), warning of growing class divides. References to "noblesse oblige" highlight tensions between privilege and responsibility in tech-driven societies.

3. **Authoritarian Fears & Historical Parallels**:  
   - Users draw dystopian comparisons to **fascism** and **Nazi singularity**, arguing unchecked AI could enable suppression, control, and a "brave new world" of authoritarianism. Concerns include AI amplifying surveillance and eroding democracy.

4. **Critique of Tech Culture**:  
   - Tech ecosystems are accused of fostering narcissism, extremism, and a lack of empathy. Discussions criticize the prioritization of profit over ethics, with AI development framed as detached from human values.

5. **Ownership & Proprietary Models**:  
   - Issues around data ownership arise, with mentions of AI systems using scraped content to reproduce outputs, undermining original creators. Proprietary AI models are seen as centralizing power and stifling transparency.

6. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Some users flag the article’s alarmist tone, while others find value in its warnings. Abstract terms like "cognitive dissonance" and "selective ignorance" describe societal complacency toward AI’s risks.

**Overall Tone**: Largely critical and anxious, with calls for ethical accountability and systemic reform to prevent AI from exacerbating societal divides and authoritarian tendencies.
