#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00241) | 128 points | by [amichail](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amichail) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42494127)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers have demonstrated that adversarial policies can outsmart even the most advanced Go-playing AI, KataGo, achieving a remarkable win rate of over 97%. Instead of employing traditional strategies, these adversarial methods deceive the AI into making critical mistakes. This tactic not only succeeds against KataGo but also transfers effectively to other superhuman Go AIs, revealing a persistent vulnerability even in AIs designed to counter such attacks. The findings raise important questions about the fallibility of advanced AI systems, as human experts can replicate these adversarial strategies without algorithmic support. The paper, titled "Adversarial Policies Beat Superhuman Go AIs," has been accepted for presentation at ICML 2023, underscoring its impact on the fields of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Full details and gameplay examples are available in the paper.

In the discussion surrounding the research paper "Adversarial Policies Beat Superhuman Go AIs," comments ranged widely, reflecting on the implications of the study and its findings. Some users highlighted the nature of Go and the strategies used by the adversarial policies that managed to defeat advanced AI like KataGo, emphasizing the unexpected vulnerabilities these AIs exhibit despite their superior design.

There was a debate on whether traditional models of play could effectively predict responses against such adversarial tactics, with some arguing that human players might find ways to leverage incorrect assumptions about AI behavior. Participants also noted the broader implications, such as how similar patterns might arise in other domains of AI, including chess, where grandmasters face challenges against modern engines.

Several comments discussed the nature of strategy in competitive play, with mentions of specific chess player attributes and how they relate to computing strategies. Others reflected on the necessity of a deep understanding of positions in both Go and chess, with mention of how human and AI players approach decision-making differently.

Overall, the discussion demonstrated a mix of technical analysis and philosophical inquiry into the nature of intelligence—both artificial and human—highlighting the unpredictable outcomes in adversarial scenarios and speculating on future developments in AI robustness against such strategies.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16145) | 101 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42493312)

A recent paper on arXiv, titled "Offline Reinforcement Learning for LLM Multi-Step Reasoning," highlights new methods to enhance large language models' (LLMs) capacity for multi-step reasoning. Authored by a team led by Huaijie Wang, the study introduces OREO (Offline Reasoning Optimization), an offline reinforcement learning approach that overcomes some limitations of existing methods like Direct Preference Optimization. 

Despite DPO showing promise in aligning LLMs with human preferences, it's hampered by a lack of paired preference data and challenges in credit assignment for multi-step tasks—often marked by sparse rewards. OREO aims to address these issues through an innovative model that optimizes learning by leveraging insights from maximum entropy reinforcement learning. Not only does this reduce the reliance on pairwise data, but it also shows significant improvements in performance on benchmarks like GSM8K and ALFWorld for tasks requiring extensive reasoning.

The authors suggest that their method can further be developed into a multi-iteration framework when additional resources are available and can aid in tree search optimization at test time, enhancing performance even further. This research signifies a promising step in improving LLMs for complex tasks, shedding light on the future of machine learning and artificial intelligence advancements.
