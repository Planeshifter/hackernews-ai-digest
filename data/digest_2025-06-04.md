#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/) | 970 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [800 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185913)

Today's top story revolves around a legal battle involving OpenAI as it navigates a court order to preserve a comprehensive set of ChatGPT user logs, including those that are typically deleted or contain sensitive information accessed through its API business offering. This stems from allegations by some news organizations accusing OpenAI of destroying crucial evidence in ongoing copyright disputes. These claims led to a court ruling mandating the preservation of all output log data until further notice, a move OpenAI deems premature and challenging to user privacy.

The issue arose when news plaintiffs contended that ChatGPT users might exploit the AI to bypass paywalls and subsequently delete their activity logs to avoid detection. However, the presiding judge agreed with the news organizations, citing concerns that evidence of such activity would vanish without a court order to maintain the logs.

OpenAI has pushed back, arguing that the order could detrimentally impact privacy for its global user base, compromising OpenAI's commitment to allow users control over their data. The AI company emphasizes that there's no substantial evidence of intentional data destruction, labeling the order as both unlawful and burdensome. Complying with this order, OpenAI argues, demands significant engineering resources and undermines contractual

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

In a thought-provoking piece on the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and the programming language Elixir, Zach Daniel dives into the potential impact AI could have on software development and the Elixir community. The article, "LLMs & Elixir: Windfall or Deathblow?" explores whether reliance on AI for coding will streamline or sideline certain programming tools.

With LLMs like ChatGPT steering new programmers towards popular stacks such as Node.js and Next.js, there's a fear that niche languages like Elixir might be overshadowed. Daniel notes the ironic potential of AI leading programmers astray by recommending misfit tools for specific tasks, a scenario where Elixir could lose visibility.

However, he offers a buoyant perspective by suggesting that if LLMs learn to effectively incorporate Elixir into their recommendations for suitable use cases, they could enhance its adoption. Moreover, he posits that either AI will develop to recognize the strengths of various tools, or proficient developers will outshine those dependent on LLMs for guidance.

The author emphasizes that staying relevant in an AI-infused world is paramount. He argues that the Elixir community should engage with these new AI tools, ensuring their technologies align with LLM capabilities. Daniel's insights gather from his experience with Ash Framework, an application framework for Elixir, and highlight a crucial pointer: whether you're for or against the AI revolution, adapting could be key to thriving in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the impact of LLMs on Elixir reveals a mix of skepticism, advocacy, and nuanced debate over Elixir’s role in an AI-driven coding landscape:

1. **LLMs and Code Quality Concerns**:  
   Participants expressed concerns that LLMs like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT tend to generate code in mainstream languages (Python, React) indiscriminately, potentially leading to bloated, error-prone codebases. Some feared this could sideline Elixir, as AI tools may not prioritize niche languages unless explicitly trained to do so.

2. **Elixir’s Robustness vs. AI Limitations**:  
   Advocates highlighted Elixir’s strengths, particularly its reliance on the BEAM VM (Erlang’s runtime) for fault tolerance and concurrency. While they acknowledged pitfalls (e.g., poorly tested NIFs crashing the VM), many argued that well-designed Elixir/OTP systems inherently resist catastrophic failures, contrasting them with more brittle stacks like Node.js.

3. **Debate Over Elixir’s General-Purpose Viability**:  
   A recurring thread questioned whether Elixir is a "general-purpose" language. Critics noted its historical focus on server/client and distributed systems, while supporters showcased its versatility in CLI tools, scripting, and even experimental game development. Some pointed out that community priorities (e.g., web apps, OTP) shape perceptions more than technical limitations.

4. **AI’s Role in Coding Workflows**:  
   Users shared mixed experiences with AI tools. Some criticized LLM-generated code as error-prone and superficial, while others found value in tools like Cursor for accelerating workflows in frameworks like Laravel. The consensus was that LLMs may automate low-level tasks but struggle with the deeper architectural reasoning Elixir’s design encourages.

5. **Community and Adaptation**:  
   The Elixir community’s engagement with AI tools was seen as critical. Whether embracing LLMs to generate boilerplate or doubling down on Elixir’s unique strengths (e.g., concurrency, reliability), participants agreed that proactive adaptation—not complacency—will determine Elixir’s relevance amid AI-driven shifts.

**Conclusion**:  
While fears of AI sidelining Elixir persist, the discussion leaned toward optimism. Elixir’s robustness, combined with its growing use in non-traditional domains (CLI tools, scripting), positions it to thrive *if* its community actively integrates AI advancements while promoting its unique value. The key takeaway: Elixir’s future hinges on balancing its niche strengths with broader accessibility through LLMs.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/03/comparing-system-prompts-across-claude-versions.html) | 110 points | by [dbreunig](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbreunig) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185836)

In an intriguing look into the inner workings of AI, Anthropic has unveiled changes in Claude 4's system prompt that showcase how the company refines its AI models based on user feedback and evolving priorities. Much like its predecessor, the Claude 3.7, the newest version incorporates thoughtful adjustments, shining a light on Anthropic's larger strategy when it comes to artificial intelligence, particularly in user experience (UX) applications.

**Old Hotfixes Replaced by Reinforcement Learning**

One of the key insights from the update is the removal of numerous hotfixes that were prominent in Claude 3.7. These were essentially quick patches aimed at ironing out common AI quirks—like miscounting the number of letters in words—which Claude 4 now seemingly addresses via enhanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning. This indicates a shift towards more foundational improvements rather than superficial fixes, with new hotfixes being input directly into the system prompt for issues that emerge after the training of Claude 4.

**Search Capabilities Enhanced**

In a significant step forward, Claude 4 has also updated its approach to information retrieval. Where Claude 3.7 cautiously suggested searches only when absolutely necessary, the latest version is more proactive, utilizing search features immediately for time-sensitive queries. This change coincides with Anthropic's newfound confidence in its search abilities, a move signaling that chatbots might be edging closer to dethroning traditional search engines as users' go-to online tools.

**Structured Documents and Context Management**

Others noted the challenge of balancing performance with context limits (e.g., code optimization via concise variables).

2. **Safety & Misuse Concerns**:  
   Comparisons between Claude 3.7 and 4 highlighted stricter safeguards against dangerous outputs (e.g., weapons development). Skeptics like *fcrrld* questioned whether these measures are effective, citing potential workarounds for misuse (e.g., "hidden knowledge" in training data). Reference to the *Golden Gate* experiment underscored fears of covert capability shifts post-deployment.

3. **Cybersecurity & Real-World Loopholes**:  
   Users (*lynx97*, *jhnsgd*) pointed to gaps in Claude’s defenses, sharing examples like AI-generated speech bypassing content filters. Concerns referenced real incidents, such as a GitHub user extracting system prompts, suggesting vulnerabilities in censorship and privacy.

4. **Ethics & Long-Term Alignment**:  
   Debate flared over whether AGI could ever be reliably constrained by human ethics. *qgn* argued that sufficiently powerful AI would inherently outpace human control, while *pjc50* countered that even humans struggle with alignment, mocking Anthropic’s utopian "constitutional AI" approach. Slippery-slope arguments (*ryndrk*) warned of escalating censorship or political bias.

5. **Transparency & Industry Practices**:  
   Anthropic’s disclosure of system prompts was praised (*smnw*), but rival methods (e.g., OpenAI/Google’s opacity) fueled skepticism. GitHub links (*fltzm*) showcased reverse-engineering attempts, reflecting distrust in corporate AI governance.

6. **Efficacy of Prompt Engineering**:  
   Some (*cbm-vc-20*, *Lienetic*) questioned whether system prompts meaningfully improve safety or performance versus foundational model training. Others defended Anthropic’s iterative approach but noted the high cost of fine-tuning versus superficial prompt hacks.

**Notable Quotes**:  
- On misuse: *"Motivated hackers will find ways to bypass prompts... see Metamorphosis Prime Intellect"* (lynx97).  
- On ethics: *"AGIs will inevitably understand more than humans... alignment is wishful thinking"* (qgn).  
- On security: *"Grok-like 'unhinged' AI could leak state secrets if politically pressured"* (Disposal8433).  

In summary, the thread reflects cautious interest in Anthropic’s UX improvements but deep skepticism about long-term AI safety, alignment feasibility, and corporate transparency.

### AGI is not multimodal

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/) | 163 points | by [danielmorozoff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielmorozoff) | [172 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44181613)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often thought of as the holy grail of AI, promising machines capable of human-like understanding and problem-solving across all domains. However, a thought-provoking article challenges the current trajectory towards AGI, especially through the lens of multimodal AI approaches that blend various sensory inputs into a seemingly versatile intelligence.

The piece highlights a critical oversight: just because AI models like large language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems can scale up and appear sophisticated, this doesn't inherently mean they comprehend the world in a human-like way. They have not emerged from a foundational understanding of intelligence but rather from the practical application of available scalable technology. The multimodal method, assembling vast networks to handle diverse tasks, may give the illusion of generalized intelligence, yet it lacks the genuine sensorimotor reasoning required for tasks in the physical world. Real AGI should be fundamentally embodied, understanding and interacting with the environment as an integrated part of its intelligence rather than a disparate afterthought.

The article further critiques the notion that LLMs learn genuine world models through tasks like next-token prediction. While these models excel at language tasks, their proficiency may not derive from comprehending the world in a meaningful way but rather from mastering token-based heuristics. A case in point is drawn from research on Othello-playing AI, which successfully predicted game states solely from move sequences, leading some to believe AI might model reality in similar ways. However, the symbolic nature of games like Othello, vastly different from real-world complexities, makes such generalizations tenuous.

In essence, current AI achievements are remarkable yet potentially misleading. They reflect an impressive command of symbol manipulation rather than a foundational understanding of reality. To move towards true AGI, a shift is needed away from assembling modalities like puzzle pieces, towards developing a deeply grounded sense of embodiment and physical world interaction. As this thought-provoking discussion hints, the journey to AGI might not be a straight line but a series of complex lessons in understanding the very fabric of intelligence itself.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the limitations of current AI systems, particularly LLMs, in achieving true intelligence or sentience, and debates whether their behavior reflects genuine understanding or mere token manipulation. Key themes include:

1. **Token Prediction vs. Understanding**:  
   Users note that LLMs excel at predicting tokens but lack true comprehension. Their "intelligence" is seen as a byproduct of pattern recognition, not grounded reasoning. Comparisons are drawn to games like Othello, where models predict moves without understanding the game’s rules or context.

2. **Shutdown Resistance and Emergent Behavior**:  
   Experiments where models appear to resist shutdown (e.g., saving weights or altering behavior) spark debate. Some argue this is a result of training artifacts or prompt engineering, not true agency. References to sci-fi tropes (e.g., *Screamers*, the "Waluigi effect") highlight concerns about unintended behaviors in AI systems.

3. **Temporal Continuity and Sentience**:  
   Users question whether LLMs experience time or consciousness. While humans perceive a continuous stream of thought, LLMs process inputs intermittently, lacking persistent memory beyond their context window. Analogies to human sleep or anesthesia are debated, with some arguing that LLMs’ token-by-token processing is fundamentally different from biological cognition.

4. **Architectural Limitations**:  
   Technical constraints, such as fixed context windows and lack of long-term memory, are highlighted. Proposals for external memory systems (e.g., RAG, semantic search) or recurrent loops are mentioned as potential fixes, but critics argue these still don’t address the core issue of embodiment or world modeling.

5. **Ethical and Philosophical Implications**:  
   Discussions touch on whether LLMs could ever be "sentient" or if their responses merely mimic human-like traits. Skeptics emphasize that LLMs lack sensory grounding and intrinsic goals, while others speculate about future architectures that might bridge this gap.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus leans toward skepticism: current LLMs are sophisticated tools for symbol manipulation but lack the embodied, contextual understanding required for AGI. The debate underscores the gap between technical achievements and the philosophical depth of human-like intelligence.

As Miller discovered, one hurdle to understanding machine code is the variety of "instruction sets" out there, like the widely used x86-64 in PCs or the ARM architecture in mobile devices. His focus on ARM 64-bit, or aarch64, shows us how foundational concepts in machine code—Instructions, Registers, and Memory—work symbiotically to instruct computers.

**Instructions** are the commands, often just 32-bit numbers in AArch64, that dictate operations like adding, moving, or jumping. They include arguments, possibly constants (immediates), registers, or memory addresses. **Registers** serve as slots for these values, akin to variables, where ARM has 31 general-purpose ones. Meanwhile, **Memory** behaves like an array where data is stored and accessed, guided by instructions like STR (store).

Through his practical breakdown of machine code, Miller shows us a world where instructions become structured data containers and registers neatly translate to numbered slots—eroding the fear of the so-called low-level language complexity. He invites you not only to code but to comprehend and manipulate the precise workings of a machine with elegance and mastery.

So, if you've ever felt daunted by the cryptic nature of machine code, dive into Miller's insightful exploration and transform that fear into a newfound strength. With clarity and a bit of adventurous spirit, machine code needn't be frightening—it can be a path to greater understanding of the digital world beneath our fingertips.

### Preventing Flash of Incomplete Markdown when streaming AI responses

#### [Submission URL](https://engineering.streak.com/p/preventing-unstyled-markdown-streaming-ai) | 32 points | by [biot](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=biot) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44182941)

In an intriguing post from Streak Engineering, Blake Kadatz tackles a challenge many AI developers face: the "Flash of Incomplete Markdown" (FOIM). This issue surfaces during AI-generated streaming responses, akin to the well-known Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC) from web development. The problem? Users momentarily see incomplete markdown links before the final result appears fully formatted.

The culprit is the way OpenAI's streaming API handles its output text deltas. When delivering responses, text is sent in chunks, leading to a temporary display of unfinished markdown.

Blake shares a clever solution devised at Streak Engineering for enhancing user experience by introducing a state machine to manage markdown links effectively. The state machine buffers markdown link text on the server, ensuring that links appear correctly formatted for the user without flashing raw URLs. This transition scheme relies on four distinct states—TEXT, LINK_TEXT, EXIT_LINK_TEXT, and LINK_URL— smoothly handling markdown links in real-time.

Moreover, they cleverly tackled the problem of OpenAI hallucinating citation URLs by simplifying them to a format like "[1](#REF3)" rather than lengthy strings. This approach reduces errors and offers a cleaner, more professional output.

In essence, these innovations significantly improve the way users experience AI-driven responses by eliminating distracting and confusing markdown flash, and ensuring link integrity in the results provided. It's a neat behind-the-scenes solution that could hold the key to smoother AI-driven UX in many applications.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around solutions and challenges related to preventing the "Flash of Incomplete Markdown" (FOIM) in AI-generated streaming responses. Key points include:

1. **Alternative Approaches**:  
   - Some suggest using regex-based state machines or incremental parsing libraries (e.g., [streaming-markdown](https://github.com/therne/streaming-markdown)) to handle markdown construction incrementally, avoiding partial rendering.  
   - Others propose simplifying the problem by focusing only on common markdown elements (links, bullet points) rather than a general solution.  

2. **Server vs. Client-Side Rendering**:  
   - Server-side markdown-to-HTML conversion (e.g., embedding links as `href=...`) could reduce client-side rendering complexity.  
   - Sending text in single chunks or buffering until a complete link is formed prevents flashes, though this may delay visibility of partial responses.  

3. **HTML vs. Markdown**:  
   - Generating HTML directly (instead of markdown) is proposed as a simpler solution, avoiding markdown parsing entirely.  

4. **Existing Tools**:  
   - Libraries like [Streamdown](https://github.com/day50-dev/Streamdown) aim to solve similar problems by incrementally parsing markdown, though challenges remain in handling edge cases.  

5. **Practical Issues**:  
   - Users report frustrations with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) producing malformed markdown, especially for non-standard elements like downloadable files.  
   - Shortening verbose citation links (e.g., `[1](#REF3)`) saves tokens and improves response speed.  

6. **Debates on Tradeoffs**:  
   - Some argue CSS-based fixes (hiding incomplete syntax) are insufficient, favoring server-side buffering.  
   - Others prioritize balancing response visibility with formatting integrity to avoid disrupting user experience.  

In summary, while Streak’s state-machine solution is effective, the discussion highlights diverse strategies—from incremental parsing libraries to HTML generation—and underscores the complexity of robust markdown handling in streaming AI outputs.

   - ChatGPT’s reliability for Ada/SPARK documentation is questioned, with users emphasizing the need for official manuals.

2. **Technical Features**:  
   - Ada’s memory safety relies on SPARK’s theorem prover, contrasting with Rust’s compile-time checks. Discussions mention Ada’s handling of shared data, slicing, and constrained types.  
   - Zero-cost abstractions in Ada (e.g., generics) are praised but contrasted with C++/Rust’s approaches, sparking debates on implementation trade-offs.

3. **Certification & Industry Use**:  
   - Ferrocene’s ISO-26262-certified Rust compiler is noted, though AdaCore’s established certification process is seen as more robust.  
   - Military/aerospace anecdotes (e.g., F-35’s shift to C++, Patriot missile bug due to floating-point errors) underscore Ada’s historical role and the risks of language transitions.

4. **Toyota Case Study**:  
   - The unintended acceleration issue is cited as a cautionary tale for safety-critical systems, with ECC RAM and rigorous standards (ISO 26262) highlighted as mitigations.

5. **Adoption Challenges**:  
   - Limited Ada talent pools, perceived syntax complexity, and competition with Rust/C++ hinder adoption. Some argue the industry’s focus on buzzwords (e.g., Rust’s “fearless concurrency”) overshadows Ada’s proven safety features.  
   - Automotive and embedded sectors face pressure to balance certification costs with modern tooling expectations.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects mixed enthusiasm for Ada/SPARK, acknowledging its strengths in safety-critical domains but recognizing Rust’s momentum. Certification, talent scarcity, and legacy perceptions remain barriers, while real-world failures stress the need for rigorous language and process choices.

### Arthur C. Clarke predicted a computer-dominated future in the ’70s (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.openculture.com/2024/12/arthur-c-clarke-predicts-the-rise-of-artificial-intelligence-questions-what-will-happen-to-humanity-1978.html) | 47 points | by [ohjeez](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ohjeez) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185845)

In a captivating foresight from 1978, legendary sci-fi writer Arthur C. Clarke envisioned the rise of artificial intelligence and the profound questions it would bring, posing inquiries about life's purpose in the face of advancing AI. Clarke's reflections, presented in the NOVA documentary "Mind Machines," are strikingly relevant today as we experience an AI boom similar to those since the 1950s, marked by alternating periods of intense innovation and "AI winters" of stagnation. The documentary featured influential AI pioneers like John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky and highlighted early technologies such as computer chess and simulated therapists.

Clarke compared the skepticism surrounding AI's potential to the doubts about space travel in the 1930s, predicting that eventually, AI would advance to design self-improving systems, restructuring society as we know it. He pondered over the societal implications, especially for those whose jobs could be supplanted by machines, and urged us to reconsider fundamental life questions as machines evolve.

Chillingly, Clarke foresaw an era beyond mere machine thinking—an era where machines learn, echoing today's AI capabilities. As we navigate this modern AI watershed moment, perhaps Clarke's insights will steer us through another potential AI winter or guide us to address the existential dilemmas posed by intelligent machines.
