PlayHT, the team behind the popular Generative Text-to-Voice AI Model, has just released their latest version, PlayHT2.0. This model is specifically trained to generate conversational speech and introduces the concept of emotions to Generative Voice AI for the first time. Users now have the ability to control and direct the generation of speech with a particular emotion. PlayHT2.0 is currently in closed beta but will soon be accessible through their API and Studio.

The team at PlayHT initially released their first model, PlayHT1.0, eight months ago, which achieved state-of-the-art results in speech synthesis quality and voice cloning. However, PlayHT1.0 had some limitations, including poor zero-shot capabilities, short speech generations, and the inability to control speech styles or emotions. To address these issues, the PlayHT team increased the model size and training dataset significantly and developed PlayHT2.0, which is a leap in the field of Speech Synthesis. 

The heart of the PlayHT2.0 system is a Large Language Model (LLM) that has absorbed countless transcriptions of audio clips, allowing it to make intelligent guesses at what the corresponding audio should sound like. The model converts text into simplified sound markers called MEL tokens and then uses a decoder model to expand and fill out these markers, ultimately recreating human speech with the help of a vocoder model.

PlayHT2.0 is trained to generate humanlike conversations and can be used for various conversational applications such as phone calls, podcasting, and audio messaging. The model is designed to think while speaking, using filler words to make the speech sound extremely realistic. The team has also made architectural innovations to improve the model's speed, reducing the time it takes to generate speech to less than 800ms.

Another impressive feature of PlayHT2.0 is its instant voice cloning capabilities. With just a few seconds of audio, the model can replicate voices with stunning accuracy and resemblance, without the need for extensive finetuning. Additionally, due to the large and diverse dataset on which the model was trained, it can clone and generate voices in almost any language or accent. Users can even make a cloned voice speak a different language while preserving the original accent.

PlayHT2.0 also introduces the ability to direct emotions in generated speech. While this feature is still in its early stages and expected to improve with more training, the model can already understand and apply basic emotions in real-time. Users can prompt the model with emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, or disgust, and it will generate speech with the corresponding emotion. This opens up the possibility of defining custom emotions on the fly, further expanding the capabilities of the model.

Overall, PlayHT2.0 represents a significant advancement in Generative Voice AI, providing enhanced conversational abilities, faster speech generation, instant voice cloning, and the ability to direct emotions in generated speech. With its impressive features and accessibility through the PlayHT API and Studio, PlayHT2.0 is set to revolutionize the field of AI-generated speech.
