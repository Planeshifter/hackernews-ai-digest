The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US is pushing for the criminalization of AI-powered robocall spam. The FCC has warned about the rising wave of scams enabled by voice-cloning technology, where machine-learning software can trick people into donating money to fraudulent causes. The agency believes that using AI voice cloning technology in robocalls should be deemed illegal under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The FCC's stance has received support from government officials across the US, and lawmakers are also working on legislation to address the issue. The goal is to protect consumers from being swindled by convincing robo-calls impersonating celebrities, politicians, and even loved ones.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to robocalls and spam.

- Several comments discuss the issue of fraudulent calls that claim to be refunding money. One user suggests that it could potentially be a problem if scammers exploit this scheme to trick people into providing sensitive information. Others suggest that it is important for customers to verify the legitimacy of such calls and be cautious about sharing personal information.

- There is a discussion about the inconvenience of receiving spam calls and texts. Some users express their dislike for unsolicited phone calls and texts, while others suggest that blocking numbers or implementing whitelists could help address the issue.

- The topic of international calls and how to handle spam from other countries is also brought up. Suggestions include blocking international calls unless they are from trusted contacts or implementing stricter terms for international carriers.

- The discussion shifts to the issue of spam SMS messages, particularly in the context of political campaigns. Some users raise concerns about the exemption of politicians from spam and junk mail laws, while others mention the importance of freedom of speech in political activities. The question of how to regulate political messages without infringing on free speech is also raised.

- There are comments about the benefit of existing laws for politicians and the potential abuse of automated calls in political campaigns. Some users express frustration with political spam and argue that it does not inform people or contribute to meaningful debates.

- The conversation concludes with a mention of a growing group of people in the UK who voted for Brexit, claiming that they were not properly informed about the consequences. This comment is in reference to the wider issue of misinformation and its impact on important decisions.

Overall, the discussion highlights various perspectives and concerns related to robocalls, spam, and the need for effective regulation in order to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of communication channels.
