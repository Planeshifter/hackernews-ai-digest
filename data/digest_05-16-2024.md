### Bye Bye, AI: How to block Google's AI overviews and just get search results

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/google-chrome/bye-bye-ai-how-to-block-googles-annoying-ai-overviews-and-just-get-search-results) | 53 points | by [adamcarson](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamcarson) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40382687)

Google's "AI Overviews" feature, known as SGE (Search Generative Experience), has stirred up controversy for its unreliable and often misleading AI summaries that dominate search results. Users have reported instances where the AI's advice, such as suggesting urine consumption for kidney stones, has overshadowed credible sources. The absence of an option to disable this function in Google settings has left users frustrated. However, there are workarounds to bypass these AI-generated summaries and access the traditional list of web pages.

For Chrome users, a simple tweak allows all searches to be directed to Google's web search tab. By adding a custom search engine with the parameter ?udm=14, queries from the address bar will skip the AI-overview-laden results. Additionally, a Chrome extension aptly named Hide Google AI Overviews hides these summaries on the search results page.

On mobile devices like Android or iOS, where Chrome lacks the flexibility of desktop browsers, Firefox offers a solution. By setting up a custom search engine in Firefox with the same parameter, users can search directly from the web tab, avoiding the AI summaries altogether.

While Google's attempt to enhance search results with AI may have missed the mark, users can take steps to ensure they receive accurate and reliable information without the interference of AI-generated content.

The discussion surrounding the submission highlights various perspectives on the impact of Google's AI summaries on search results and its implications for developers:

1. Some users express frustration over the poor quality of Google search results and the difficulty in disabling the AI summaries on mobile devices.
2. Suggestions are offered for bypassing the AI-generated summaries by using specific search parameters in browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
3. A debate ensues on whether AI poses a threat to developers, with arguments about the evolving nature of technology and the role of developers in adapting to these changes.
4. The conversation also touches on concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated content and the potential implications for the development community.
5. Overall, there are mixed opinions on whether AI summaries are beneficial or detrimental to users and developers, with some highlighting the importance of accurate information and the potential impact on the tech industry as a whole.
