### HyAB k-means for color quantization

#### [Submission URL](https://30fps.net/pages/hyab-kmeans/) | 41 points | by [ibobev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ibobev) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44514946)

Pekka Väänänen of 30fps.net dives into a fascinating exploration of color quantization using an intriguing twist on the traditional algorithm: the HyAB distance formula in CIELAB color space. At the heart of this exploration is the quest for enhanced image quality by converting the RGB values of an image into CIELAB space, where color differences can be calculated more in line with human perception. 

Väänänen is inspired by the FLIP error metric and a 2019 paper that introduces an alternative method for large color differences—HyAB, a hybrid distance formula combining "city block" and Euclidean distances. This method aims to improve perceptual accuracy by treating lightness and chroma as separate when calculating color differences. 

The real clincher in Väänänen’s research is applying the HyAB-inspired technique to k-means clustering, a statistical method popular for its applicability in color quantization. The idea is to select a suitable palette of colors from a high-color image by clustering similar colors together. By using the HyAB formula in place of the standard Euclidean distance within CIELAB space, the color quantization is allegedly more representative of actual visual differences.

The results of implementing this method show promise: images processed with the HyAB-adjusted k-means retain hues more accurately than those quantized with traditional methods, like sRGB or pure CIELAB with Euclidean distance. This method particularly shines in maintaining distinct hues in challenging colors like magenta and green, though with some caveats, such as a halo effect around red hues.

Väänänen explores further refinements, such as weighting the luminance differently in the HyAB formula, which offers more control over the final appearance without distorting hues, a common issue when other weights are adjusted in sRGB or CIELAB spaces. This weighting flexibility adds a layer of customization to how images can be processed under specific aesthetic goals or constraints.

While there's still ongoing debate about whether this method surpasses all traditional techniques, Väänänen’s experiment stands out by making the k-means clustering more adaptable through HyAB. It highlights how understanding and manipulating the theory behind color perception can translate into practical improvements in digital image processing, a critical concern in many fields including graphic design, printing, and digital media.

In summary, Väänänen's work is a testament to the power of rethinking established formulas with a perception-centric approach. It's an encouraging invitation for other developers and researchers to further explore color quantization's possibilities for more visually authentic and nuanced digital images.

The Hacker News discussion explores the trade-offs between color spaces like **OKLab**, **CIELAB**, **CAM16-UCS**, and **HyAB** for tasks like color quantization, gradient rendering, and dynamic design systems. Here's a distilled summary:

### Key Points of Debate:
1. **OKLab vs. CAM16-UCS**:
   - **OKLab** is praised for its simplicity, speed, and smoother gradients (e.g., in CSS), avoiding grays in blue-yellow transitions. Critics argue it’s a simplified, "good enough" model but lacks the perceptual rigor of **CAM16-UCS**, which is derived from complex color appearance models.
   - **CAM16-UCS** is considered more accurate but computationally intensive (e.g., converting 16M RGB colors to CAM16 takes ~6 seconds in Dart/JS), making it impractical for real-time applications.

2. **Performance vs. Accuracy**:
   - For web and design tools (e.g., CSS gradients), OKLab’s speed and deterministic results are prioritized. Real-time systems need conversions in **milliseconds**, not seconds.
   - Material 3’s dynamic color system uses clustering (Celebi’s K-Means) for accessibility and contrast, emphasizing deterministic outcomes over perfect perceptual accuracy.

3. **Perceptual Uniformity**:
   - OKLab claims perceptual uniformity but faces skepticism. Critics highlight edge cases (e.g., blue-yellow gradients) where CAM16-UCS might better model human vision. Proponents argue OKLab’s simplicity and smoother gradients suffice for most design needs.

4. **Gamut Mapping**:
   - OKLab’s approach (e.g., Oklch in CSS) is noted for smoother gamut mapping compared to CIE Lch, though some confusion arises about whether this is due to the color space or the mapping algorithm itself.

5. **Industry Use**:
   - Tools like Google’s Material Design balance theory with practicality. While CAM16 is scientifically robust, OKLab’s ease of implementation makes it a pragmatic choice for workflows requiring speed and simplicity.

### Conclusion:
The thread underscores the tension between **scientific rigor** (CAM16-UCS) and **practical application** (OKLab). Design systems prioritize speed and deterministic results, while academic contexts favor accuracy. OKLab’s adoption in CSS and tools highlights its niche as a "good enough" solution, even as debates about its perceptual fidelity persist.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/what-are-we-even-doing-here/) | 188 points | by [tobr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tobr) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44507244)

In a candid exploration of the challenges faced while modernizing Shopify email notification templates, Robin Sloan highlights a curious encounter with Shopify's LLM-powered developer documentation bot. The issue centers on figuring out how to detect if an order includes items fulfilled through Shopify Collective, a task that led Sloan to seek advice from the doc bot after traditional search methods fell short.

The bot's initial suggestion seemed plausible, proposing a Liquid syntax solution that should have worked. However, real-world testing (which involved repeated order placements and refunds) revealed that the requisite "Shopify Collective" tag wasn't attached to the order until after the confirmation email was sent. This delay in tagging, a nuance not documented, rendered the bot's advice ineffective.

Sloan questions the reliability of AI-powered documentation that may resort to educated guesses rather than providing infallible insights, especially when official documentation stakes are high. Despite some past successes in quick queries, this incident underscores the critical need for precise and dependable guidance in tech environments.

Ultimately, Sloan found a workaround by adapting existing code, checking product-level tags available at the email's generation time, successfully identifying Shopify Collective orders. This tale not only warns of the pitfalls of over-relying on AI but also celebrates the ingenuity required to navigate around them when they fall short.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and limitations of using AI, particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, for technical documentation like Shopify's LLM-powered bot. Key points include:  
1. **AI vs. Human Judgment**: While AI can quickly generate plausible answers, it often struggles with **nuance** and **accuracy** in complex technical contexts. Users note that AI may confidently provide incorrect or incomplete solutions (e.g., missing real-world timing issues like delayed order tagging), highlighting the need for human oversight.  
2. **RAG System Limitations**: Technical hurdles with RAG—such as **context window constraints**, degradation in accuracy with larger documents, and inefficiency in filtering relevant information—make it unreliable for intricate queries.  
3. **Cost and Scalability**: Some argue AI documentation tools are cost-effective and faster than human efforts, but skeptics warn hidden costs (e.g., error correction) and context-handling flaws undermine scalability.  
4. **Human-Curated Documentation**: Participants stress that structured, **human-written documentation** remains critical, as AI cannot yet match the reliability, contextual awareness, and adaptability of expert-driven content.  
5. **Workarounds and Adaptability**: The incident underscores the necessity of developer ingenuity (e.g., using product tags) to bypass AI shortcomings when official documentation fails.  

Overall, the consensus leans toward **cautious integration of AI**—valuing its speed but recognizing its fallibility—while advocating for hybrid approaches that prioritize human expertise in critical technical domains.

### Using MPC for Anonymous and Private DNA Analysis

#### [Submission URL](https://vishakh.blog/2025/07/08/using-mpc-for-anonymous-and-private-dna-analysis/) | 36 points | by [vishakh82](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vishakh82) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44508866)

Monadic DNA embarked on a unique project earlier this year, aiming to demonstrate how individuals could access and interact with their genetic data while maintaining privacy through cutting-edge technology. At an event in Denver, thirty pioneering participants provided saliva samples, which were processed using Multi-Party Computation (MPC) technology developed by Nillion. This ensured participants could analyze their genotyping results without ever exposing sensitive raw data.

The sample collection took place during the ethDenver conference, drawing a lively crowd at Terminal Bar thanks to perfect weather and a bit of social media buzz. Though the turnout was higher than anticipated, the team managed the rush effectively. Participants signed forms, selected kit IDs and PINs, and submitted their samples, being rewarded with both a drink and an optional digital token, known as a POAP, marking their participation.

The samples were then handled by Autogen, a lab chosen for their ability to manage both timelines and the privacy needs of the project. Despite only needing basic metadata like kit IDs, many labs expressed a willingness to work with anonymized samples, underscoring a trend towards privacy-respectful genomic research.

The data processing used the Global Screening Array for genotyping, providing participants with insights from around 500,000 genetic markers. This choice struck a balance between cost and data richness, opting against full-genome sequencing due to its high costs and current market irrelevance.

Once processed, the anonymized data was shared securely via standard cloud storage solutions, enabling participants to claim and analyze their genetic information confidentially. This project not only underscored the potential of MPC technology in safeguarding genetic data but also laid the groundwork for more private consumer genomic products in the future.

### Springer Nature book on machine learning is full of made-up citations

#### [Submission URL](https://retractionwatch.com/2025/06/30/springer-nature-book-on-machine-learning-is-full-of-made-up-citations/) | 130 points | by [ArmageddonIt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ArmageddonIt) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44507061)

In an unexpected twist fit for a sci-fi drama, one of the latest machine learning resources might be taking some creative liberties with the truth—when it comes to citations, at least. The book "Mastering Machine Learning: From Basics to Advanced" by Govindakumar Madhavan is raising eyebrows—and not just for its $169 price tag. Published by Springer Nature, it turns out that many of the book's citations might be more fiction than fact.

Retraction Watch, tipped off by a concerned reader, dug into this mystery and discovered a murky world of missing or incorrect citations. An analysis of 18 out of 46 references revealed that an astonishing two-thirds weren't quite what they seemed. Some researchers even found themselves surprisingly cited for works they never wrote, with one paper cited being no more than an unpublished arXiv preprint inaccurately referred to as an IEEE publication.

This citation conundrum hints at the possible use of AI-style generation methods, reminiscent of those employed by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models, while proficient in creating human-like text, can sometimes fall prey to fabricating references, creating fictitious citations that look realistic but don't hold up under scrutiny.

Madhavan hasn't fully offered clarification on whether AI played a role in crafting his book, but he acknowledged the growing difficulty in distinguishing between AI- and human-generated content. As the debate over the use of AI in academia continues, this case underscores the importance of rigorous verification, lest we end up with scholarly versions of "alternative facts." The mystery deepens, awaiting further comment from the author, who is no stranger to the tech world, leading SeaportAi and creating an array of educational resources. Stay tuned as this tale of academic intrigue unfolds!

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the implications of AI-generated content in academia, sparked by a book published by Springer Nature containing fabricated citations. Key points include:

1. **AI’s Role in Content Creation**:  
   Users debate the difficulty of distinguishing AI-generated text from human writing, especially as LLMs advance. Some suspect the book’s citations were AI-generated, highlighting issues like "confabulation" (mixing real and invented references) and overconfident but inaccurate outputs.

2. **Publisher Accountability**:  
   Springer is criticized for damaging its reputation by failing to verify content. Commenters note a trend of declining textbook quality, with publishers prioritizing profit (e.g., high prices for poorly reviewed books) over rigorous peer review. References to past publishing errors (e.g., typos, incorrect images) suggest systemic issues.

3. **Verification Challenges**:  
   - Existing tools like DOI links and AI detectors are deemed insufficient, as they can’t always validate context or prevent circular dependencies (e.g., GPT-4 generating valid-looking but fake citations).  
   - Suggestions include manual checks, cross-referencing summaries with source material, and better institutional incentives for thorough peer review.

4. **Broader Academic Concerns**:  
   - Fear that AI could exacerbate problems like paper mills, fraudulent research, and "citation stuffing" to game academic metrics.  
   - Jokes about a future where AI reviews AI-written content, creating a self-referential loop of unverified information.  
   - Nostalgia for traditional, human-curated resources and lament over the erosion of trust in educational materials.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:  
   Mention of "Sturgeon's Law" (90% of content is "crap") underscores worries that AI might flood academia with low-quality work. Commenters stress the need for vigilance, better tools, and a return to quality-focused publishing practices to preserve scholarly integrity.  

In summary, the discussion reflects skepticism about AI's unchecked use in academia, frustration with profit-driven publishing, and calls for more robust validation mechanisms to combat misinformation.
