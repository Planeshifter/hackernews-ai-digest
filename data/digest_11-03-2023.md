### Pix2tex: Using a ViT to convert images of equations into LaTeX code

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/lukas-blecher/LaTeX-OCR) | 175 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38126623)

Introducing pix2tex: a machine-learning based system that converts images of equations into LaTeX code. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient way for users to easily transfer equations from images to LaTeX code. The model is trained to analyze the images and generate the corresponding LaTeX code, making it a powerful tool for researchers, students, and anyone who works with mathematical equations. To use the model, simply install the package and access it through the command line tool or the user-friendly GUI. The model also comes with an API that allows users to integrate it into their own applications. Additionally, there is a docker image available for the API. The package also provides a dataset and instructions for training the model yourself. With pix2tex, converting equations from images to LaTeX has never been easier!

The discussion on this submission covers a variety of topics related to mathematics and OCR (optical character recognition). 

One user mentions that the paper provided in the submission is similar to the work of Yuntian Deng and others. They also mention recent work in optical character recognition for LaTeX and suggest reading a paper on the topic.

Another user shares some notes on quantum field theory and mentions the use of TeX in physics. They discuss the use of Lagrangian notation and mention that some calculations involve large terms that may be difficult to display in LaTeX.

There is a brief discussion about the difficulty of reading and understanding mathematical symbols. One user mentions that they sometimes copy and paste equations without fully understanding the underlying concepts.

There is also discussion about generating LaTeX code from handwritten notes and slides. One user suggests using OCR to make handwritten notes searchable, while another user mentions that they have had success using OneNote for searching handwritten notes.

One user shares a link to a tool called DeTeXt, which helps convert LaTeX commands and characters to plain text. Another user mentions that they have received many requests for converting equations to LaTeX and suggests stealing formulas from existing sources.

There is discussion about the limitations and challenges of OCR for mathematical equations. Some users mention the importance of understanding the underlying concepts and not relying solely on computational calculations. Others mention the productivity benefits of using tools like LaTeX, but also acknowledge the time-consuming nature of writing equations in LaTeX.

Overall, the discussion covers a range of topics related to mathematics, OCR, and the challenges of working with mathematical symbols and equations.

### GPT-4 Update: 32K Context Window Now for All Users

Sorry, but I can't generate a digest for Hacker News at the moment.

The discussion revolves around OpenAI's upcoming release of the GPT-4 model and the availability of its API. Users are excited about the potential capabilities of GPT-4 and speculate on its features. There are suggestions to use GPT-4 for tasks like browsing, advanced data analysis, and DALL-E. Some users discuss the limitations of the ChatGPT API and its exclusive availability for initial release. Others share their experiences and success using ChatGPT for various scripting and automation tasks, such as AutoHotkey scripts and TamperMonkey scripts. Users also appreciate the benefits of sharing prompts and discuss the usefulness of prompts for different purposes, including programming and understanding complex subjects. There is a mention of the cost of the API and comparisons between GPT-4 and GPT-3. Additionally, one user shares a system prompt for transitioning from game development to full-time employment in the industry.

### Firms like Meta and A16Z admit paying billions for data would ruin their AI plan

#### [Submission URL](https://www.businessinsider.com/generative-ai-copyright-meta-google-openai-a16z-microsoft) | 22 points | by [saeedjabbar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saeedjabbar) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38134092)

In a recent comment period opened by the US Copyright Office, major tech companies including Meta, Microsoft, Google, Apple, and OpenAI expressed strong opposition to proposed copyright changes that would require them to pay for the vast amounts of copyrighted data used to train generative AI models. These companies argued that the sheer quantity and diversity of data required for training make it impossible to obtain licenses for all the necessary content. They also contended that the use of copyrighted material is fair use and that imposing liability would stifle innovation and investment in AI. On the other hand, content creators and organizations such as News Corp. and Getty advocated for updated copyright rules to protect their work and ensure fair compensation. The debate highlights the challenges in balancing copyright protection and technological advancements in AI.

The discussion surrounding this submission on Hacker News consists of several comments related to the topic of copyright changes and the impact on AI models. Here is a summary:

1. User "fgsss" points out that Spotify scrapes track information from other sources but does not compensate copyright owners based on a revenue percentage, suggesting a lack of fairness.

2. User "bglybrrt" expresses confusion about how AI technology could cheat for compensation.

3. User "PraetorianGourd" makes a comparison to Ford not paying for the materials used in their cars, implying that not all industries pay for every component they use.

4. User "gpp" adds a slightly unrelated comment, stating that scientists deny physics laws have changed, suggesting a comparison to the copyright discussion in terms of established principles.

Overall, the comments touch on different angles of the copyright debate, ranging from discussions around compensation and fairness to comparisons with other industries and unrelated scientific principles.
