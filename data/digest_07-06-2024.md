In a thought-provoking essay titled "A Thousand Primers, Not Just One," Andy Matuschak challenges the notion that gamification is a one-size-fits-all solution for education, emphasizing the importance of specific gamification tailored to the subject matter. He critiques the tendency towards "generic gamification," where generic game-like features are haphazardly added to apps and teaching materials without consideration for their effectiveness.

Drawing from his experience creating the popular running game Zombies, Run!, Matuschak highlights the necessity of understanding the unique nature of an activity when designing gamified experiences. Unlike other running games that failed to resonate with players, Zombies, Run! succeeded by immersing itself in the nuances of running, offering a compelling and engaging experience specific to the activity.

Through his insights and examples, Matuschak underscores the significance of thoughtful and targeted gamification strategies that truly enhance the learning or engagement experience, debunking the myth of one universal primer for all educational needs.
