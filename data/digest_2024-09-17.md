### Chain of Thought empowers transformers to solve inherently serial problems

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875) | 258 points | by [krackers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=krackers) | [175 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41562673)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers Zhiyuan Li and colleagues delve into the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) technique, which enhances the capabilities of transformer models in tackling complex computational tasks that typically require serial processing. While previous work established that transformer models struggle with such tasks, particularly when their depth is limited, this paper offers a theoretical insight into why CoT significantly boosts the models' performance in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning problems.

By examining the expressiveness of constant-depth transformers, the authors reveal that without CoT, these models can only handle simpler problems. However, when provided with intermediate steps through CoT, the depth-limited transformers expand their problem-solving abilities to encompass any issue solvable by boolean circuits of a certain size. The empirical results are compelling, showing substantial accuracy improvements in areas like permutation group composition and circuit value challenges as CoT is employed.

The findings pave the way for deeper understanding and application of CoT in enhancing language models' performance, especially in scenarios difficult for parallel computation. This research was accepted at ICLR 2024 and offers a fresh perspective on the computational potential of transformers.

2. **Formal Language Challenges**: Several commenters discussed the intricacies of transforming informal problem statements into formal languages, emphasizing the difficulties in formalizing certain problem representations. This led to conversations about the limitations of current models in adequately translating and solving these problems without comprehensive contextual understanding.

3. **Complexity and Turing Machines**: The relationship between CoT and the capabilities of Turing machines was examined, with some participants suggesting that CoT could be vital in enhancing a model's ability to recognize complex formal languages.

4. **Practical Implications**: There was a discourse on the practical applications of CoT in real-world scenarios, particularly in algorithms and programming, suggesting that the new theoretical insights can broaden the scope of complex task processing in AI.

5. **Challenges in Formal Problem Solving**: Many commenters pointed out the fundamental challenges in addressing problems given to LLMs (Large Language Models) and the intricacies of problem statements, indicating that translating informal questions or problems into a formalized solution remains a significant obstacle.

Overall, the discussion highlighted both the theoretical advancements provided by the CoT technique and the ongoing challenges in formalizing and solving complex tasks using transformer models. The conversation underscored the importance of further research to bridge these gaps.

### Can Generative Multi-Agents Spontaneously Form a Society?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2409.06750) | 47 points | by [geuds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geuds) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41567138)

In an exciting new paper titled "Can Agents Spontaneously Form a Society?" researchers H. Zhang, J. Yin, M. Jiang, and C. Su introduce a groundbreaking architecture called ITCMA-S for generative multi-agent systems. Unlike traditional frameworks that often focus on solitary tasks, the ITCMA-S architecture emphasizes social interactions among agents, enabling them to filter and select behaviors that encourage positive social engagement.

Through experimental simulations in a sandbox environment, the authors found that these identity-less agents could naturally form social structures, including cliques with designated leaders and collective activities. The results demonstrate promising indicators of social emergence, as agents actively explored their environment and developed new relationships through ongoing dialogue and action.

This research could have significant implications for multi-agent systems in various fields, including artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction, by showcasing the potential for agents to form complex societies spontaneously.

In the discussion around the submission about the ITCMA-S architecture for generative multi-agent systems, users engaged in varied topics related to the implications of social interactions among agents. One commenter, "krnck," highlighted the connection between isolated communities of children and language development, suggesting that similar dynamics could be observed in agent behavior. "kridsdale3" referenced the concept of software life cycles and how it parallels the formation of social structures in non-playable characters (NPCs).

Another user, "bbr," found the research fascinating and drew cultural comparisons, mentioning how it aligns with ideas from Marvin Minsky's "Society of Mind." They emphasized the importance of theoretical frameworks in understanding how agents can collaborate and perform tasks in a general context. The discussion hinted at a mix of optimism and skepticism regarding the practical applications of these findings, with references to pop culture scenarios like "Terminator" and "SkyNet," reflecting a broader concern about AI development. Overall, the conversation indicates a deep interest in the implications of social structures not only in AI but also in a wider societal context.
