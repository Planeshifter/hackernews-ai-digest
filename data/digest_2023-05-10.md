Google has announced PaLM 2, its newest large language model (LLM) that will power the company's updated Bard chat tool, alongside most of its new AI features. Built on Google's latest JAX and TPU v4 infrastructure, PaLM 2 is trained on over 100 languages and is better at common sense reasoning, mathematics, and logic. Its improved support for writing and debugging code is based on training on 20 programming languages, including those less commonly used. PaLM 2 is available to developers via the PaLM API, Firebase, and Colab. However, it is not clear how the company trained this 540-billion parameter model nor how it performs in various scenarios.

While some praised PaLM 2 for its capabilities, others expressed doubt over the lack of technical documentation and the secrecy surrounding its training. They also speculated on its potential to revolutionize interaction with computers. Some commenters questioned why Google released a medical-focused model of PaLM 2 and not just a more generalized one. Additionally, one commenter flagged the fact that Bard is not currently supported in Canada, and some mentioned Google's competition with OpenAI's GPT models.

#### [Submission URL](https://ashvardanian.com/posts/abusing-vector-search/) | 105 points | by [vov_or](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vov_or) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35887983)

Vector search is a trending topic, with Weaviate raising $50M and Pinecone raising $100M, but Ashot Vardanian demonstrates that it's not a difficult task by building a single-file vector search engine - USearch - that is both fast and open-source. USearch, built with just 1,000 lines of C++11, is not only AI-related and limited to equidimensional vectors but also supports non-equidimensional vectors and custom similarity measures. The tool demonstrates various non-AI use cases, including a geo-spatial indexing use case and a stock market use case. USearch can be used with a range of programming languages, including Python, JavaScript, Java, Rust, GoLang, and Wolfram.

The discussion initially focuses on the difficulty of building vector databases and search applications, with some users suggesting it is not as difficult as it seems and that modern databases are integrating solutions. One user points out that chess positions and moves can be represented as vectors and suggests some potential use cases for this. Another user suggests using custom weighting schemes for different positions to improve search. The discussion then shifts to a debate on whether to allow emojis or not on Hacker News.
