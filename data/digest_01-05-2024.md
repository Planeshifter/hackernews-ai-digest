In a recent article, Jared Edward Reser proposes a framework for building a thinking AI by simulating human-like thought processes. He focuses on replicating the dynamics of the mammalian working memory system, which features two forms of persistent activity: sustained firing and synaptic potentiation. Reser suggests that in an AI implementation, these two memory stores should be continuously and iteratively updated, with each state preserving a proportion of the coactive representations from the previous state. This iterative updating allows for the gradual evolution of concepts in working memory and the generation of associatively linked intermediate states, leading to progress towards a solution or goal. Reser conceptualizes iterative updating as an information processing strategy, a model of working memory, a theory of consciousness, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial general intelligence. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the framework, including literature review, implications, and suggestions for instantiating the model within a computer.
