### AI and the Automation of Work

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2023/7/2/working-with-ai) | 196 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [214 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36565854)

In a recent blog post, Benedict Evans discusses the impact of generative AI, Large Language Models (LLMs), and ChatGPT on the automation of work. He acknowledges that while there is agreement in the tech industry about the transformative power of these technologies, there is much debate about the implications and future consequences.

Evans points out that automation has been happening for the past 200 years, and each wave of automation has eliminated certain jobs but also created new ones. However, when facing automation in our own generation, it's natural to worry that the new jobs won't materialize. While historical evidence suggests otherwise, it's hard to predict what new jobs will emerge.

To address this concern, Evans refers to the "Lump of Labour" fallacy, which assumes that there is a fixed amount of work to be done and automation reduces job opportunities. He argues that when automation makes things cheaper, it leads to increased consumption and the creation of new jobs. The ripple effect through the economy generates prosperity and employment.

One criticism of this model is that automation has been progressively moving up the scale of human capabilities. From physical labor to white-collar jobs, if we automate white-collar work, what's left? To counter this, Evans introduces the concept of the Jevons Paradox, which explains that as technology becomes more efficient, it's used more extensively, leading to increased resource consumption. In the case of white-collar work, automation has historically created new opportunities rather than eliminating jobs.

Evans gives examples from history, such as the impact of typewriters and adding machines on clerical employment. Although these technologies reduced the number of clerks required for certain tasks, they also increased productivity and enabled new forms of work. Similarly, he argues that automation can lead to more analysis, improved inventory management, and the creation of businesses that can only exist because of automation.

In conclusion, while concerns about job displacement due to automation are valid, historical evidence suggests that new jobs will emerge. Automation has consistently led to increased productivity and economic growth. Although we can't predict the exact nature of future jobs, Evans remains optimistic that automation will continue to present new opportunities for prosperity.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the capabilities and potential dangers of AI taking over various jobs. Some users express concerns about security issues and the potential for AI machines to misinterpret human intentions, leading to fatal mistakes. Others argue that AI reporting machines can be useful in certain situations but should not replace human judgment entirely. The discussion also touches on the impact of automation on the military and law enforcement sectors, with some users pointing out the risks and limitations of relying too heavily on AI in those fields. There is a debate about whether AI will truly replace human jobs or if it will primarily enhance them by taking over tasks that are repetitive or require specific expertise. Overall, the discussion raises valid concerns about the implications of AI in the workforce while also acknowledging its potential benefits.

### Automated CPU Design with AI

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12456) | 89 points | by [skilled](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=skilled) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36565671)

Researchers from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have made a significant breakthrough in the realm of machine design. In a recent publication, titled "Pushing the Limits of Machine Design: Automated CPU Design with AI," a team of 18 authors led by Shuyao Cheng introduces a revolutionary approach to automatically designing a central processing unit (CPU) using AI techniques. CPUs are considered one of the most complex devices ever created by humans, making the successful application of AI in their design a remarkable achievement.

In their research, the team developed a method that allows machines to design a CPU solely based on external input-output observations, rather than relying on formal program code. The AI approach generates the circuit logic of the CPU design using a graph structure called Binary Speculation Diagram (BSD), ensuring both accuracy and efficiency. To demonstrate the capability of their method, the researchers explored an unprecedentedly large search space of 10 to the power of 10 to the power of 540 possibilities, which is considered the largest of all machine-designed objects to date.

After only five hours of computation, the team's approach successfully generated an industrial-scale RISC-V CPU, which was able to run the Linux operating system and perform comparably to the human-designed Intel 80486SX CPU. This breakthrough not only significantly reduces the design cycle in the semiconductor industry but also has the potential to reform it by enabling machines to learn the von Neumann architecture autonomously.

The research paper, totaling 28 pages, was submitted to the arXiv preprint server under the category of Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI) and Hardware Architecture (cs.AR). The authors provide extensive technical details and analysis of their methodology, making it a valuable resource for researchers in the field. This groundbreaking work represents a significant leap forward in machine design, opening up new possibilities for AI systems to tackle increasingly complex tasks in the future.

They also mention that the high-level diagram in Figure 1 appears to show an expected input-output process, but the commenter is unsure if the paper discusses predefined components and their connections in the design.

- Another commenter points out that the implementation of the AI-designed CPU was executed on an Intel Xeon Gold 6230 CPU cluster, not on an FPGA as stated in the summary. They also mention that the implementation was done on 65nm technology, and the resultant CPU was manufactured in December 2021.

- A commenter expresses doubts and skepticism about the AI approach, suspecting that the discussion in the paper does not touch upon important points such as register mapping, memory access, and control registers. They question the effectiveness of the AI approach without considering these critical aspects.

- Another commenter raises concerns about the lack of verification and the complexity of implementing the generated designs, particularly noting the absence of voltage-aware translation to make the CPU comparable to an Intel 486SX.

- A discussion ensues regarding the complexity and potential limitations of the paper's approach. One commenter suggests that the design lacks certain optimizations and that the implementation of high-level details, such as placement, can be challenging. Another commenter notes that the research focuses on exploring a design space rather than optimizing existing approaches.

- The discussion briefly touches on the topic of Google's Tensor processing units and their connection to AI-driven chip designs.

- One commenter raises questions about the human-designed architecture discovery process and whether the AI approach can replicate it.

- There are suspicions raised about the validity and credibility of the paper. One commenter suggests that the claims made may be fraudulent or misleading, while another commenter expresses concerns regarding the reputation of Chinese institutions and their history of fraudulent papers.

### It's 2023 and memory overwrite bugs are not just a thing theyre still number one

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/29/cwe_top_25_2023/) | 111 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36562727)

Memory overwrite bugs continue to be the most dangerous type of software bug, according to MITRE. These bugs, also known as out-of-bounds write bugs, are responsible for 70 vulnerabilities on the US government's list of known vulnerabilities that are under active attack. Out-of-bounds write bugs occur when software or hardware alters memory it shouldn't, causing unexpected changes or crashes. Exploit code can trigger these bugs to take control of the software. MITRE recommends using memory-safe languages like Rust to prevent these bugs. Cross-site scripting bugs and SQL injection flaws are the second and third most dangerous bugs, respectively. CISA has added eight more vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, including flaws in D-Link and Samsung devices. The list of the Top 25 most dangerous software weaknesses for 2023 remains the same as last year. MITRE will publish reports to help organizations effectively use the Top 25 list.

The discussion on this submission covers several different topics related to memory overwrite bugs and the use of memory-safe languages like Rust. Here are some key points from the discussion:

- One user argues that array bounds errors are the number one problem that can be addressed by using memory-safe languages like Rust. They suggest that existing features in these languages make it straightforward to prevent and detect such bugs.
- Another user expresses confusion about the proposal and suggests that the discussion is politically motivated. They argue that the proposal should be made public for everyone to understand and debate.
- There is a discussion about technical resistance to introducing syntactic changes in C. Some users point out the challenges and potential compatibility issues that could arise from changing existing APIs and function prototypes.
- The use of attributes for function prototypes, variable declarations, and nested structures is mentioned as a possible solution to prevent bugs and avoid the need for a complete rewrite of existing code.
- One user mentions that adding warning flags to the compiler could help address some of the issues related to passing arrays without length.
- The discussion also touches on issues related to first-class slice types and checked interfaces for accessing arrays. Some users express concerns about the complexity and potential performance impact of such features, while others argue that they could improve safety in programming languages like Rust and C#.
- The trade-offs between handling out-of-bounds errors and memory corruption are discussed. Some users suggest that handling out-of-bounds errors is generally preferred, while others argue that memory corruption is a larger problem.
- The possibility of introducing mandatory bounds checking in C++ is mentioned, with some users expressing support for the idea and others expressing concerns about the impact on performance and programming language standards.
- The resistance to standards bodies and the importance of working groups in addressing security-related improvements are discussed.
