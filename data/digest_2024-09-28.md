In a significant boost for Dart developers, a new project called **dart_interactive** has launched, providing a fully featured interactive REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) for Dart. Notably responding to the community's seventh most-voted request, this tool allows users to creatively engage with Dart code in real-time, facilitating quicker iterations and experimentation.

Key features of **dart_interactive** include:
- **Third-Party Package Support**: Users can easily integrate and utilize external packages.
- **Hot Reload**: Modify your code on-the-fly while preserving the current state.
- **Full Grammar Support**: Engage with complex statements, class definitions, and functions seamlessly.

The project demonstrates a user-friendly interface where developers can mix code execution with concurrent modifications, enhancing productivity similar to environments like IPython or Jupyter for Python. This release could greatly enhance the efficiency and enjoyment of Dart coding, catering to both newcomers and seasoned developers.

To get started, interested users can install it via standard Dart package commands and dive into an intuitive coding experience. With its widespread potential, dart_interactive is poised to become a beloved tool in the Flutter and Dart community.

### Our ping pong startup hit a $50M valuation in 5 years by tapping into automation

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2024/09/27/startup-entrepreneurs-automation-ping-pong-sports-venues-tech-saas-smartphone-apps-pingpod-podplay/) | 50 points | by [tomwiddles](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomwiddles) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41681875)

In a compelling journey from idea to success, David Silberman, cofounder of PingPod, shares how his ping pong startup reached a remarkable $50 million valuation in just five years. The concept was sparked in 2019 when Silberman, an equity research analyst and avid player, found a lack of ping pong venues in New York City. Thus, PingPod was born—24/7 automated ping pong facilities that eliminate the need for full-time staff, tapping into the growing "experience economy."

Starting with a single location in Manhattan, PingPod now boasts 18 outlets across major U.S. cities and additional locations in the UK and Philippines. The model's success stems from cutting operational costs and maximizing accessibility. Players book spaces through an app, with cutting-edge technology streamlining operations. This innovative approach is not limited to ping pong; under its SaaS subsidiary PodPlay, the company has partnered with over 70 venues across various sports, showcasing the versatility of their automated system.

With a focus on the digital-first preferences of younger generations, PingPod offers an inviting space that balances affordability and convenience. By reducing labor costs and increasing venue capacity, the startup boasts impressive profit margins. Safety remains a top priority, with advanced security protocols and monitoring to ensure a trouble-free playing experience.

Silberman believes their trajectory hints at a broader trend: urban spaces are increasingly evolving from traditional retail to experience-driven destinations. As PingPod continues to expand and innovate, it's setting the stage for a new frontier in sports and recreation, marked by autonomy, community, and memorable experiences.

The discussion on Hacker News about David Silberman's PingPod highlighted various perspectives on the startup's business model and its comparison to traditional ping pong clubs. Some commenters pointed out that while PingPod offers competitive pricing and convenience through its automated system, traditional clubs like the Boston Table Tennis Club provide a community atmosphere and access to coaching, which might be missed in a fully automated environment. 

Several users discussed the pricing structure, with some mentioning that they pay $50 per hour for private facilities in different cities, while others shared experiences of more affordable memberships at smaller clubs. Concerns were raised about the sustainability of a labor-light model, emphasizing the need for personal monitoring to ensure safety and a positive customer experience. 

Comments also touched on the broader trend of experience-oriented businesses evolving in urban environments, akin to the rise of venues like Top Golf. There was skepticism regarding the long-term viability of fully automated sports venues and whether they could match the community-driven aspects of traditional setups. 

Overall, the discussion reflected both interest and concern over PingPod's innovative approach to recreational sports and how it fits into changing consumer preferences. The conversation also hinted at the challenges of balancing automation with personal touch in service-based industries.

### xAI's 100k GPUs data center in Memphis is up and running

#### [Submission URL](https://www.semafor.com/article/09/27/2024/elon-musks-new-memphis-data-center-hits-an-ai-milestone-with-nvidia-chips) | 33 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41677481)

Elon Musk's xAI data center in Memphis, nicknamed "Colossus," has achieved a groundbreaking milestone by bringing all 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips online simultaneously. This remarkable feat establishes it as the most powerful known computer on the planet, positioning xAI as a formidable player in the AI race. Despite skepticism from some industry experts about the technical logistics of operating such a massive array of GPUs, the facility's rapid operational timeline of less than six months marks a significant technical accomplishment.

The Memphis center will be vital for training xAI's AI model behind Grok, described as an uncensored alternative to ChatGPT. Musk's ambitious plans face energy challenges, with the company resorting to tapping natural gas turbines to sustain power supply while larger infrastructure solutions are sought. Energy demands for modern AI models are escalating, prompting leaders like OpenAI's Sam Altman to appeal for government assistance in developing power-hungry data centers.

As the competition intensifies to build more robust AI infrastructure, investments from major players such as Microsoft and BlackRock are fueling a $30 billion fund aimed at expanding data center capabilities. Ultimately, while merely aggregating compute power does not guarantee superior AI performance, industry consensus suggests that more computational resources can lead to increasingly advanced models.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around Elon Musk's xAI data center, "Colossus," which features the simultaneous operation of 100,000 Nvidia H100 chips. Participants express skepticism about the feasibility of managing such a large-scale cluster effectively due to inherent networking limitations and the challenges of distributed systems. 

One commenter suggests that while smaller clusters are common and typically used to address specific problems, the sheer scale of Colossus presents unique difficulties in performance, checkpointing, and data storage. Another points out that Meta's cluster is also scaling up, with ambitions of reaching a larger capacity. Generally, there is concern about the potential complexities and practical implications of running such an extensive array of GPUs, with some doubts about whether a single cluster of that size can realistically operate efficiently.
