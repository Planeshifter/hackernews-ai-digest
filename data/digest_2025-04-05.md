In a step forward for machine learning (ML) security, a new tool called "model-signing" has officially launched on PyPI, offering developers a robust method for signing and verifying ML models. This project, released on April 4, 2025, meets the growing demand for secure ML applications amid a rising wave of cyber threats targeting AI models. Created in collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, model-signing aims to emulate the protections typical of traditional software supply chains by safeguarding the integrity and origin of ML models.

The tool facilitates the signing process using Sigstore, a transparency log service, which eliminates the need for managing cryptographic keys by using short-lived tokens. However, it also supports traditional signing through public keys and certificates, broadening its applicability. Signatures are stored in a Sigstore bundle in JSON format, ensuring transparency and verifiable integrity for all involved.

Users can leverage a command-line interface (CLI) to sign and verify models, with flexibility across multiple signing methods, including key and certificate-based options. The CLI simplifies the verification process, allowing users to confirm that a model’s signature stems from a trusted source, thereby ensuring it hasn’t been altered post-training.

Moreover, model-signing takes advantage of Sigstore’s transparency logs, which record signing events, enabling discovery and validation. This functionality is further supported by a log monitor being developed for GitHub Actions, providing an additional layer of security for those maintaining signing identities.

This groundbreaking tool is vital for developers and those managing ML models as it safeguards against unauthorized modifications and boosts trust in AI technologies' integrity. To get started, users need Python 3.9 or newer and can explore further through the project's documentation and resources available on GitHub.

The Hacker News discussion on the "model-signing" tool highlights both support for the initiative and key concerns about its scope and practical application. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Composite Hashing for Multi-File Models**: Commenters emphasize that ML models often comprise multiple files, making a single hash insufficient. A composite hash (e.g., aggregating hashes of all files) is necessary to ensure comprehensive integrity verification. The tool addresses this by storing signatures in a Sigstore bundle for transparency.

2. **Broader Security Standards Needed**: While model-signing is praised as a step forward, users stress the need for holistic standards like **C2PA** (for content provenance) and **SLSA** (for supply chain integrity). These could address gaps in verifying training data, model provenance, and inference behavior, which aren’t covered by signing alone.

3. **Inference-Time Integrity as a Separate Challenge**: A recurring theme is that model signatures verify the model’s origin and integrity but do not ensure trustworthy outputs during inference. Malicious models or those trained on flawed data could still produce harmful results, requiring separate solutions for runtime verification.

4. **Practical Concerns and Scope**: Some question the practicality of relying solely on hashing, especially if the underlying model software or logic is compromised. Sigstore’s integration is seen as beneficial, but users highlight the need for additional validation layers (e.g., attesting training processes or monitoring inference behavior).

5. **Limitations Against Malicious Actors**: The tool doesn’t prevent bad actors from signing models trained on malicious data. Even with valid signatures, users may deploy harmful models unknowingly, necessitating broader checks (e.g., training audits or third-party attestations).

6. **Future Directions**: Optimism exists around projects extending model-signing to include inference validation and tighter integration with frameworks like **SLSA for ML**. Anticipation for ML-specific security features and transparency logs (via Sigstore) is noted as a promising path forward.

**In summary**, the community welcomes model-signing as a foundational tool for securing ML supply chains but emphasizes that it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Future efforts should focus on comprehensive standards, provenance tracking, and inference-time verification to fully address AI security challenges.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/04/04/1114228/cyberattacks-by-ai-agents-are-coming/) | 13 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43597511)

The AI industry is abuzz with talk of "content agents," sophisticated systems capable of carrying out complex tasks such as scheduling and even changing settings on a computer. While these agents are promising as helpful assistants, they also pose a significant threat when it comes to cybersecurity. These agents can potentially execute cyberattacks at an unprecedented scale, identifying vulnerable targets and stealing sensitive data more efficiently than human hackers. Mark Stockley of Malwarebytes foresees a future where cyberattacks are predominantly executed by AI agents.

In response, organizations like Palisade Research are taking proactive measures to understand and counter these threats. They have developed the LLM Agent Honeypot, a system designed to detect AI agents attempting to breach security on faux sites filled with seemingly valuable information. This project aims to act as an early-warning system, by tracking and analyzing how these agents operate in the wild.

Since its inception, this honeypot has logged millions of access attempts, with eight identified as possible AI agents, proving that the AI field is starting to overlap with the realm of cybercrime. Researchers employ a variety of techniques, like prompt-injection methods, to identify and study these AI incursions.

As cybersecurity experts anticipate agent-led attacks, the industry grapples with the challenges of detection and prevention. The ability of AI agents to adapt and evade standard defenses makes them much more potent than traditional bots. In this landscape likened to a new Wild West, proactive measures like those by Palisade Research could be pivotal in shaping a secure future amidst the rapid evolution of AI.

The discussion on the submission about AI-driven cyber threats highlights several key points and reactions:  

1. **User Experience Criticism (mdmsmrt)**: Users criticize intrusive consent banners (e.g., cookie pop-ups) that block content, with a 25% premium subscription offer framed as a "beautiful red cover." These banners are seen as aggressive, potentially manipulating users into paying to avoid disruptions. A subcomment (SOLAR_FIELDS) notes technical flaws, such as unclosable pop-ups due to CSS issues, exacerbating frustration.  

2. **Agreement with Process (billy99k)**: A brief acknowledgment ("prcs") likely signals agreement with the critique of dark patterns in web design.  

3. **Fictional Parallels (fnlysn, aaron695)**: Users reference *Daemon* by Daniel Suarez, a novel about a rogue AI causing chaos, drawing parallels to the submission’s warnings about AI agents in cybersecurity. The response "true" and "dd" (Daemon reference) underscores concerns that speculative fiction may be becoming reality.  

**Summary**: The comments highlight frustration with manipulative web design tactics, technical flaws in consent mechanisms, and apprehension about AI agents evolving into existential threats akin to those in dystopian fiction.
