### DoNotPay has to pay $193K for falsely touting untested AI lawyer, FTC says

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/09/startup-behind-worlds-first-robot-lawyer-to-pay-193k-for-false-ads-ftc-says/) | 297 points | by [Brajeshwar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar) | [196 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41659324)

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has taken action against DoNotPay, the AI startup once touted as "the world's first robot lawyer," for making misleading claims about its services. The agency found that DoNotPay had not tested its AI chatbot to confirm its effectiveness compared to human lawyers, nor did it employ legal professionals to oversee or validate its outputs. As part of a settlement, DoNotPay has agreed to pay $193,000 and must inform past subscribers about the limitations of its law-related features.

DoNotPay, which initially launched as a free tool to contest parking tickets in 2015, expanded its offerings to encompass various legal areas without lawyer oversight. Even as it began charging subscription fees, it continued to make several dubious claims in advertisements to boost its user base. This enforcement action is part of the FTC's broader initiative, dubbed "Operation AI Comply," aimed at curbing deceptive practices within the AI industry. FTC Chair Lina Khan emphasized that using AI to mislead consumers is illegal, reinforcing the notion that no company can escape legal accountability, regardless of technology.

The discussion around the FTC's action against DoNotPay reflects a mix of skepticism and concern regarding the legitimacy of AI-based legal services. Commenters noted that while some praised DoNotPay for providing assistance to users contesting legal issues, others raised alarms about the questionable practices used to market its services without proper oversight or validation by legal professionals. There were references to the general trend of startups inflating their capabilities, sometimes leading to "growth hacking" tactics that mislead consumers.

Some highlighted the inherent complexities and failures within the legal system that make AI solutions attractive, yet others stressed that AI should not replace human oversight in legal matters due to the potential for significant consequences. Discussions included the nature of growth in tech, the potential pitfalls of AI in legal contexts, and the broader implications of misleading advertising in the industry.

Commenters also emphasized the need for transparency and accountability in AI tools, suggesting that while technology can aid consumers, it should not be at the cost of exploiting the legal system or misrepresenting capabilities. The overall tone indicated a cautious approach towards AI in legal spheres, advocating for a balanced approach that takes into account both innovation and consumer protection.

### Over 300 New 'Nazca Lines' Geoglyphs Have Been Revealed by AI

#### [Submission URL](https://thedebrief.org/look-over-300-new-nazca-lines-geoglyphs-have-been-revealed-by-ai/) | 88 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41661673)

A groundbreaking study led by Masato Sakai and his team from Yamagata University has unveiled over 300 previously hidden geoglyphs on Peru's Nazca Pampa, thanks to advanced AI technology. This remarkable discovery nearly doubles the known number of Nazca Lines, bringing the total to around 730. These ancient artworks, some dating back 2,000 years, were created by skillfully manipulating surface stones and gravel on a desert tabletop that has protected them from erosion.

Utilizing an AI imaging tool called ResNet50, the researchers identified various designs, including both geometric formations and figurative representations of animals and humans. Notably, 81.6% of the new relief-type geoglyphs depicted human figures or domesticated animals. The majority of these newly discovered designs are intricate and significantly smaller than the iconic line-type geoglyphs that can be appreciated only from the air.

The team's findings not only boost our understanding of the cultural significance of these geoglyphs but also hint at the likelihood of many more awaiting discovery. Sakai emphasized that the existence of these ancient artworks continues to inspire both scholarly research and wild, often unsubstantiated theories about their origins, including suggestions of ancient flight and extraterrestrial encounters. This research opens a unique window into the life and beliefs of the Nazca civilization, linking art, astronomy, agriculture, and communication in intriguing ways.
