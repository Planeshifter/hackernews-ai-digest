#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/12/metas-new-ai-image-generator-was-trained-on-1-1-billion-instagram-and-facebook-photos/) | 325 points | by [my12parsecs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=my12parsecs) | [202 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38557054)

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has released a free standalone AI image-generator website called "Imagine with Meta AI." The website is based on Meta's Emu image-synthesis model, which can generate unique images from written prompts. The AI model was trained using 1.1 billion publicly available images from Facebook and Instagram. Previously, this technology was only available in messaging and social networking apps like Instagram. Users can now access the image generator on the "Imagine with Meta AI" website. The AI-generated images have been described as aesthetically novel, with the model being able to handle complex prompts and create photorealistic images relatively well. However, it doesn't perform well in text rendering and other media outputs. Overall, the AI image synthesis seems to be average compared to similar models.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the legal implications of using Meta's AI image generator and whether it infringes copyrights. Some users mention that Meta's terms of service grant them a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to host and distribute the generated images. Others argue that the AI model does not explicitly violate copyright as it does not reproduce exact copies of copyrighted material. 

There is also a discussion about the limitations of AI image synthesis and its ability to be considered creative or copyrightable. Some users point out that current AI models lack the ability to produce substantial creative expression and therefore may not be subject to copyright protection. However, others argue that copyright can be infringed if the AI generates images that closely resemble copyrighted material.

Additionally, there are discussions about the complexity of copyright law and the interpretation of certain provisions. Some users mention the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and its safe harbor provisions, while others highlight the criteria for copyrightability and the level of creativity required for a work to be protected.

Overall, the discussion explores the legal aspects and technical limitations of AI image synthesis in relation to copyright law.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the topic of prompt injection and the potential risks associated with it. Some users express concerns about the security vulnerabilities of large language models (LLMs) and the need for safeguards against prompt injection attacks. Others argue that prompt injection is not a significant concern and that LLMs have limitations in terms of their ability to generate malicious content. 

There is a debate about the effectiveness of prompt injection as a security threat and whether it is a valid concern in real-world LLM applications. Some users point out that prompt injection is only a limited risk and can be addressed by implementing relatively simple techniques. Others highlight the potential dangers of prompt injection, such as the leakage of private data or the manipulation of privileged server information.

The discussion also touches on the challenges of implementing LLMs and the importance of trust and reliability in these models. Some users express skepticism about the trustworthiness of LLMs and argue that human-like expertise and stochastic information production are crucial for generating trustworthy content. There are also mentions of potential solutions, such as using validation benchmarks or rejecting requests that contain subversive instructions.

The debate extends to the topic of corporate responsibility and the risks associated with giving LLMs access to databases. Some users argue that granting LLMs write access to databases could lead to the overwriting of critical data or the exploitation of customer information. Others emphasize the importance of considering the risks and ensuring the robustness and reliability of LLM applications.

Overall, the discussion on Hacker News highlights the varying perspectives on prompt injection and the need for responsible deployment and use of LLMs to address potential security and trust issues.

### Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16141) | 52 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38552186)

A new research paper titled "Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Exploiting Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks" has been submitted to arXiv. The authors, Shuo Chen and his colleagues, discuss the challenges of pruning deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to the binary and non-differentiable nature of spike signals. Pruning is an important technique for reducing the computational and storage requirements of SNNs, making them more suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources. However, existing pruning methods for SNNs often require high time overhead to make pruning decisions. 

To address this issue, the authors propose a regeneration mechanism based on criticality, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience. They introduce a low-cost metric for the criticality of pruning structures and rerank the pruned structures based on their criticality. By regenerating the structures with higher criticality, they are able to obtain more efficient pruned networks. The authors evaluate their method using popular deep neural network architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-19, for both unstructured and structured pruning. Their method achieves higher performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods with the same time overhead. Furthermore, they achieve comparable performances, and even better results on VGG-16, compared to the state-of-the-art methods with 11.3x and 15.5x acceleration.

The authors also investigate the underlying mechanism of their method and find that it efficiently selects potential structures, learns consistent feature representations, and reduces overfitting during the recovery phase. The paper is categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning.

Overall, this research paper presents a novel approach to efficient pruning of Spiking Neural Networks by exploiting criticality, offering promising results compared to existing methods.

The discussion on this submission includes several different points of view. Some users discuss the challenges of training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compared to traditional neural networks, emphasizing that SNNs are not differentiable and cannot use backpropagation. However, there is disagreement on this point, with one user arguing that recent work has shown it is possible to compute gradients in SNNs using backpropagation algorithms that involve spike communication. Another user suggests a technique for recording spike events in an SQL database, allowing for efficient queries and determining the contributors to specific output spikes.

There is also discussion about the feasibility of implementing SNNs on hardware and the potential benefits of event-driven architectures. A user mentions that SNN models can be run on simple CPUs but may require specialized hardware for improved performance. Another user highlights the efficiency of event-driven software and its implications for simulating networks.

In response to a comment about the gradient computation in SNNs, another user suggests using differentiable approximations for spike-based learning in order to optimize the weights of the network. They propose a principled version of injecting noise into the network, which can help in classifying patterns with different probabilities.

There is a brief exchange about the scalability of training large SNNs, with one user mentioning that they stopped using a method that involved billions of neurons for training long short-term memory (LLM) SNNs. Another user points out that current hardware may not efficiently support the constraints of SNNs.

Towards the end of the discussion, a user shares their curiosity about improving the functioning of brains, prompting another user to express interest in improved brain models, particularly in relation to memory and communication abilities.

Overall, the discussion delves into various aspects of SNNs, including training challenges, hardware implementation, noise injection, and scalability. There is also interest in understanding and improving the functioning of biological brains.
