### Unsupervised speech-to-speech translation from monolingual data

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/12/unsupervised-speech-to-speech.html) | 20 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497549)

Google Research has introduced Translatotron 3, an unsupervised speech-to-speech translation architecture that can learn the translation task from monolingual data alone. Traditional speech-to-speech translation models rely on parallel speech data, which is scarce, leading to the need for synthesized data. However, Translatotron 3 eliminates the requirement for bilingual speech datasets by incorporating techniques such as back-translation, pre-training with SpecAugment, and unsupervised embedding mapping based on Multilingual Unsupervised Embeddings (MUSE). Experimental results between Spanish and English show that Translatotron 3 outperforms a baseline cascade system. By preserving paralinguistic characteristics, such as tone and emotion, Translatotron 3 aims to improve the quality and authenticity of translated speech.

The discussion revolves around the Translatotron 3 submission on Hacker News. One user, "xnx," comments on the challenges of translating languages and mentions that it often stretches the mind. Another user, "grsv," responds, stating that it is humans' sentience and comprehension that allows them to learn languages, and the proposed method relies on training models with monolingual speech-text datasets. "grsv" further explains that the proposed method utilizes a shared embedding space for languages, forcing the model to learn semantics independently of the language. Additionally, they mention using back-translation for training and conducting performance checks using a Spanish-English-Spanish translation loop. They express enthusiasm for the promising and interesting results, wondering how similar the languages need to be at a lexical level for the model's performance to excel. Another user, "IanCal," shares their curiosity about the level of complexity in English and internal linguistic representation, and suggests that if there is a low complexity in mapping internal representations, then a sensible sentence in English should result in a sensible sentence in the translated language.

Overall, the discussion focuses on the methodology and potential implications of Translatotron 3, with users expressing interest in the results and exploring the nuances of language translation.

### Galactic algorithm

#### [Submission URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_algorithm) | 115 points | by [sockaddr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sockaddr) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500782)

In computer science, there is a concept called a galactic algorithm. These are algorithms that have incredible theoretical performance but are never actually used in practice. There are a few reasons for this. Sometimes the performance gains only apply to problems that are so large they never occur in real-world scenarios. Other times, the complexity of the algorithm outweighs the relatively small gain in performance. These algorithms are named "galactic" because they will never be used on any data sets here on Earth.

Even though galactic algorithms are not used in practice, they can still contribute to computer science in a few ways. Firstly, they may introduce new techniques that can eventually be used to create practical algorithms. Secondly, as computational power advances, previously impractical algorithms may become feasible to use. Thirdly, even if an algorithm is impractical, it can still demonstrate that certain bounds can be achieved or prove that proposed bounds are incorrect, thereby advancing the theory of algorithms.

For example, there are galactic algorithms for problems like integer multiplication, matrix multiplication, communication channel capacity, sub-graph testing, cryptographic breaks, and the traveling salesman problem. These algorithms have impressive theoretical performance, but their large constants make them impractical for real-world use. However, they still serve important purposes. For instance, they can inspire further research and refinement to make them more practical or they can settle important open problems in computer science, like the P versus NP problem.

So, while galactic algorithms may never be used in practice, they still have value in advancing the field of computer science and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to galactic algorithms. One commenter shares a link to a paper that discusses a simulated annealing algorithm for solving global optimization problems. Another commenter expresses doubt about the practicality of these algorithms, suggesting that simulated annealing and random restarts may not be effective. Another user finds the topic interesting and mentions that numbers can be fascinating. 

One commenter asks if the concept of galactic algorithms can be applied to other fields. Another user shares a link to Optimal Universal Search, which is related to the topic of optimal algorithms. 

There is also a discussion about the classification of General Relativity as a galactic algorithm for solving Newtonian Equations. A user argues that General Relativity is not a true galactic algorithm because it provides similar answers when calculating the motion of spacecraft around a black hole. However, another user argues that the comparison is not accurate and that the complexity and practicality of General Relativity differ from galactic algorithms.

The discussion ends with a user mentioning that General Relativity is used in GPS to correct clock discrepancies based on its small correction below a galactic scale.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/universitaet/aktuelles_meldungen/einzelansicht_410816.en.jsp) | 51 points | by [FinnKuhn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FinnKuhn) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38494466)

Scientists at the Technische Universität Darmstadt in Germany have developed a technique using the optical Talbot effect to increase the number of qubits in a quantum computer without requiring additional resources. Qubits are the basic units of information in quantum computing and can process both "0" and "1" simultaneously, allowing for parallel calculations. Currently, quantum computers are limited to a few hundred qubits, but for practical applications, such as optimizing traffic flows, thousands or millions of qubits are needed. The Darmstadt team's approach uses laser beams and a glass element with microlenses arranged like a chessboard to create a 3D lattice of focal points that can hold individual atoms as qubits. By exploiting the Talbot effect, multiple layers of qubits can be added without needing additional laser output. The researchers were able to create 16 layers of qubits, potentially allowing for over 10,000 qubits. The team plans to further develop the technology for applications in quantum technologies and high-precision optical atomic clocks.
