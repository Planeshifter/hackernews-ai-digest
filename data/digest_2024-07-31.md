#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/health-wellbeing/robot-dentist-world-first/) | 86 points | by [voxadam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=voxadam) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41119646)

In a groundbreaking achievement for dental medicine, Boston-based company Perceptive has introduced the world's first fully automated robot dentist, which recently completed its inaugural procedure on a human patient. This autonomous dental surgeon operates with impressive speed, performing tasks that usually take an average dentist about two hours in just 15 minutes.

The robot utilizes advanced 3D imaging technology through a hand-held scanner that employs optical coherence tomography (OCT), effectively replacing potentially harmful X-rays. With around 90% accuracy in cavity detection, the robot impressively prepares teeth for crowns and claims to operate safely, even while the patient is moving.

Perceptive's CEO, Dr. Chris Ciriello, heralded the technology as a pivotal step toward enhancing dental precision, efficiency, and access to care. Clinical experts believe the innovation could transform patient experiences by reducing time spent in the dentist's chair and increasing the number of patients treated.

While the robot is not yet FDA-approved and its public rollout remains uncertain, Perceptive aims to expand its capabilities and broaden its treatment options. As autonomous surgery becomes more commonplace, patients may soon find that the future of dentistry is not only faster but more comfortable and efficient—if they can get past their initial apprehensions about robots wielding drills.

The discussion on Hacker News surrounding the announcement of Perceptive's automated robot dentist covers various opinions and insights into the implications of such technology in dental care. 

**Key Themes:**

1. **Access to Care and Cost Reduction**: Many commenters highlight the potential of the robot dentist to improve access to affordable dental care, especially in areas lacking quality dental services. There is hope that broader deployment could significantly lower costs.

A recent analysis of the impact of generative AI, particularly large language models like ChatGPT, highlights a significant shift in online knowledge communities. Research examining data from Stack Overflow and Reddit between October 2021 and March 2023 showed a notable decline in Stack Overflow’s user activity following the release of ChatGPT in late 2022. This decrease particularly affected newer users, suggesting they may feel less integrated into the community.

In contrast, developer communities on Reddit maintained stable participation levels. The study attributes this resilience to Reddit's strong social bonds, which appear to buffer the potentially negative effects of AI tools. While generative AI can enhance information sharing and productivity, the findings raise concerns about its role in diminishing the interpersonal dynamics crucial for collaboration, mentorship, and career development. The authors call for strategies to create a sustainable balance between human engagement and AI assistance in knowledge exchange platforms.

The discussion on Hacker News centers around the impact of generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, on knowledge-sharing communities such as Stack Overflow and Reddit. Users express concerns over a significant decline in activity on Stack Overflow since the introduction of ChatGPT, with many suggesting that this could be due to the LLMs providing quick answers that undermine the motivation for human interaction and mentorship.

**Key Points from the Discussion:**

1. **Decline in Engagement**: Several commenters pointed out that Stack Overflow is seeing a drop in user engagement, particularly from newer users who may feel less integrated due to the prevalence of LLMs that answer questions quickly and can lead to a sense of disconnection from the community.

2. **Reddit Resilience**: In contrast, Reddit communities maintain stable participation levels, which many attribute to the strong social bonds formed within these groups, softening the potential negative impacts of AI on user interaction.

3. **Expert Participation**: There is a shared consensus that experts are becoming overwhelmed by the quality of queries, leading to a perceived reduction in meaningful contributions and discussions. Some users argue that the reliance on AI-generated content is harming the dynamics that typically characterize community engagement and knowledge sharing.

4. **Balancing AI and Human Interaction**: The calls for creating a sustainable balance between human participation and AI assistance highlight the need for community strategies that preserve interpersonal relationships critical to mentorship and collaboration.

5. **Potential for Over-Reliance**: Comments suggest that over-reliance on LLMs can discourage users from posting complex questions, as they may hope for quick answers from AI instead of engaging with the community, which could lead to a decline in the quality of interactions and learning opportunities.

Overall, the discussion underscores a growing concern about how generative AI may reshape online knowledge communities, emphasizing the need for strategies that foster community engagement alongside leveraging AI capabilities.
