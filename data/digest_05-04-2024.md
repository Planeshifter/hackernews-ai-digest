#### [Submission URL](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/the-mirror-fusion-test-facility/) | 117 points | by [not_a_boat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=not_a_boat) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40257843)

In 1986, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory celebrated the completion of the "Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B" (MFTF-B) with a dedication ceremony attended by 300 individuals. However, just as the project was finalized after a decade of development and almost a billion dollars in funding, it was shut down on the same day without ever being turned on. The reasons behind this decision were rooted in budget pressures, with then-Secretary of Energy John Herrington expressing regret in a letter to program director T. Kenneth Fowler.

The MFTF-B project featured impressive components, such as a 400-ton "yin-yang" magnet that was the largest superconducting magnet in the world at the time. This magnet, capable of generating magnetic fields 150,000 times that of Earth's, was designed to contain the high-temperature plasma required for fusion energy research. Despite the shutdown, the quest for fusion energy continued, with scientists at the National Ignition Facility achieving a significant milestone in 2022 by recording a fusion reaction with a net energy gain.

The 1970s energy crisis spurred interest in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, leading to substantial investments in fusion research. Two main approaches emerged from this period: the torus-shaped "tokamak" design and the magnetic mirror approach exemplified by the MFTF-B. While the tokamak design was more widely adopted, the MFTF-B represented a different path in the pursuit of fusion energy.

The decision to pursue the MFTF-B at such a large scale was met with debate and uncertainty, with factors like ideology and strategic considerations playing a role. Despite the disappointment of having the project mothballed immediately after completion, the researchers were left grappling with the abrupt end of their ambitious endeavor.
