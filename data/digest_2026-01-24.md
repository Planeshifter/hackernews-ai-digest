### Shared Claude: A website controlled by the public

#### [Submission URL](https://sharedclaude.com/) | 80 points | by [reasonableklout](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reasonableklout) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46741923)

Shared Claude: a crowdsourced website you steer by texting an AI. Visitors text the posted number; Claude mediates and curates submissions that appear live on the page, with a running log of accepted/declined contributions. The result is a playful, ever-shifting canvas of tiny apps, memes, and experiments—think Twitch Plays meets Notion minimalism.

What’s on it now: a prime generator, a MIDI keyboard, a snowman minigame, a live weather tracker, an AI model poll, a hyper-customizable chess engine (toroidal boards, fairy pieces, AI vs. AI), Redactle, unit converters, ASCII art, and sci‑fi lore snippets. It also foregrounds an inclusive “safe space” message and strict house rules (clean widgets in; neon chaos, autoplay audio, and heavy tracking out). Embedded videos are stripped for privacy with off-site links instead. SMS is powered by Sendblue.

Why it’s interesting: it’s a low-friction experiment in collective AI interaction and moderation—letting a community co-create a site in real time within clear aesthetic and safety constraints. It raises good questions about curation, guardrails, and whether this kind of AI-mediated play can scale beyond novelty.

Here is a daily digest summary of the discussion surrounding "Shared Claude":

**The Vibe: "Twitch Plays Pokémon" Meets Web Development**
The comment section reveals a chaotic, real-time battle for control over the site. Users described the experience as an AI version of the "Million Dollar Homepage" or "Twitch Plays Pokémon." The "collaborative" aspect quickly devolved into prank warfare:
*   **The "Delete" Button:** Multiple users reported effectively wiping the site. One user (*xplsn-s*) claimed to have instructed the AI to "ruthlessly remove bloat," resulting in the deletion of 45,000 lines of code. Another user noted the site went blank, joking that unit tests must have passed anyway.
*   **Audio Pranks:** User *Narciss* shared a cautionary tale of pressing a prominent red button on the site while their partner slept, only for it to blast a maximum-volume fart sound through their house.
*   **Hacker News Style:** User *rstrk* attempted to strip the site down to a minimalist functionality resembling Hacker News itself, though they hit guardrails when trying to impersonate Y Combinator CEO Garry Tan.

**Security and Safety Concerns**
While many found the chaos nostalgic and creative, others raised practical concerns:
*   **Malware Fears:** Some users were hesitant to open the site, noting that adblockers were flagging it. There was speculation about whether the AI guardrails were strong enough to prevent the hosting of illegal material or CSAM.
*   **API Longevity:** Several commenters expressed surprise that Anthropic hasn't revoked the API key yet, given that allowing internet strangers to pipe unsecured input directly into the model is usually a recipe for a ban.
*   **The SMS Gatekeeper:** Confusion arose regarding how to actually edit the site (some looked for input fields on the page). When it was clarified that edits require sending a real SMS text, users theorized this added friction acts as a necessary "safety layer" against bots and spam.

**Summary**
The community views "Shared Claude" as a messy, nostalgic throwback to the creative, unregulated days of the early internet. While entertaining—featuring battles over adding crypto-miners versus removing them—most observers believe the experiment is living on borrowed time before safety filters or API limits shut it down.

### Claude Code's new hidden feature: Swarms

#### [Submission URL](https://twitter.com/NicerInPerson/status/2014989679796347375) | 479 points | by [AffableSpatula](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=AffableSpatula) | [308 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46743908)

Could you share the Hacker News link (or the article text) for the submission you want summarized? Also let me know:
- Target length: ~60, ~120, or ~200 words
- Include HN community reactions? (yes/no)
- Add a “Why it matters” takeaway? (yes/no)

If you can’t share the link, the title and a short description work too.

**The Submission:**
**[Simulating a Full Dev Team with AI Agents](https://imgur.com/a/rdEBU5I)**

**Summary:**
A developer shared a radical workflow for porting a legacy Java server to .NET by simulating a comprehensive 9-agent software team entirely with AI. Using a single instance of Claude Opus as the "manager" and sub-agents (running Sonnet, Haiku, and Gemini) acting as Scrum Masters, Architects, and QA testers, the system utilized a 7-stage Kanban board and isolated Git worktrees. The author claims that by ignoring API costs and enforcing strict separation of concerns, the "team" produced high-quality, production-ready code for a complex migration.

**Hacker News Community Reactions:**
*   **Context Management:** The primary consensus is that this approach works not because the AI understands the "roles," but because it solves the context window problem. By feeding specific agents only the relevant context (e.g., a "QA agent" only seeing code to be tested), success rates improve significantly compared to massive, all-encompassing prompts.
*   **Persona Validity:** Users debated whether prompting an LLM with "You are a Scrum Master" actually improves performance. While some cited a 2023 paper claiming personas have a negligible or random effect, others argued that research is outdated regarding improved 2024 models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.
*   **Conway’s Law:** several commenters noted this is an AI variant of Conway’s Law: the communication structure of the agent swarm inevitably dictates the design of the resulting software.

**Why it matters:**
This discussion suggests that the future of AI programming isn't just about smarter models, but about **orchestration**. The experiment demonstrates that imposing bureaucratic structures (managers, tickets, code reviews) on AI might actually be a feature, not a bug. By treating "management overhead" as a method for strict context control, developers can potentially bypass the reliability limits of single-shot prompting for complex architectural tasks.

### JSON-render: LLM-based JSON-to-UI tool

#### [Submission URL](https://json-render.dev/) | 70 points | by [rickcarlino](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rickcarlino) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46746570)

Top story: json-render turns AI prompts into safe, streamable UIs via a schema-constrained JSON DSL

What it is
- A library that lets you define a “component catalog” (props, actions, validation) with Zod, prompt an LLM, and render its JSON output directly to your React components.
- Ships @json-render/core and @json-render/react; includes a React renderer, progressive streaming, and one-click code export to a standalone Next.js project (no runtime dependency).

How it works
- You declare components and actions with schemas (createCatalog + zod). Example: Card, Metric with strict prop types; actions like export(format).
- Users prompt (“Create a login form”, “Build a feedback form with rating”). The LLM is constrained to emit JSON that matches your catalog.
- The renderer streams partial JSON and progressively paints the UI.
- Data binding via JSON Pointer paths; supports conditional visibility and named actions your app handles.

Why it matters
- Moves AI UI generation from brittle freeform codegen to safe composition against your design system and types.
- Guardrails eliminate hallucinated components/props and make outputs testable and reviewable.
- Streaming yields fast feedback loops; code export reduces lock-in and eases handoff to engineers.

What HN is asking about
- Depth of interactivity: complex state, async effects, and custom logic beyond “actions.”
- Accessibility, theming, and design-system parity in the generated code.
- Versioning/migrations when the catalog evolves; round-tripping edits to exported code.
- Security: ensuring actions are whitelisted and data binding can’t be abused.
- Performance and fit with React Server Components.

Getting started
- npm install @json-render/core @json-render/react
- Define your catalog with zod, prompt the AI, render the streamed JSON, optionally export a full Next.js project.
- GitHub and docs are linked from the site.

**Discussion Summary**
The community discussion focused on where this tool fits within the existing ecosystem of schema-based generation.

*   **vs. OpenAPI/Swagger:** Several users initially questioned why a new system was needed over OpenAPI or GraphQL. Proponents clarified that while those standards describe *data* and *APIs*, `json-render` is distinct because it describes *User Interfaces* and presentation layers to prevent LLMs from generating malicious or broken React code.
*   **Historical Parallels:** One commenter drew a comparison to 4th Generation Languages (4GLs) from the 90s (like Informix), which similarly built simple applications and forms directly from database schemas.
*   **Vercel & Lock-in:** There was speculation that this technology might be a repackaging of internal Vercel experiments (similar to how `v0` works), with some skepticism regarding proprietary lock-in versus open portability.
*   **Reliability:** Users experimenting with similar patterns (generating dashboards via JSON) reported that when paired with modern models like GPT-4 or o1 and structured outputs, the reliability is surprisingly high.
*   **Accessibility Trees:** The conversation branched into how LLMs interact with UIs generally. While `json-render` handles UI *generation*, users discussed the complementary value of using accessibility APIs (via Playwright or MCP) to help AI agents "read" and navigate existing interfaces, though some warned of the high token limits required for such approaches.

### Comma openpilot – Open source driver-assistance

#### [Submission URL](https://comma.ai) | 348 points | by [JumpCrisscross](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=JumpCrisscross) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46740029)

Comma Four: openpilot-based driver assistance for 325+ cars

Comma.ai’s new “comma four” is a plug-in aftermarket driver-assistance unit that brings lane centering, adaptive cruise, automated lane changes, dashcam recording, OTA updates, and 360° vision to a wide range of vehicles (Toyota, Hyundai, Ford, Lexus, Kia, and more). The system runs the open-source openpilot stack and the company claims it can “drive for hours without driver action” while remaining an active driver-assistance (not self-driving) product.

Highlights
- Works with 325+ supported models across 27 brands; examples include recent Hyundai/Kia/Toyota/Lexus models
- Feature set: lane centering, adaptive cruise, automated lane changes, dashcam mode, 360° vision, OTA updates
- “Buy it, plug it in, and engage” install experience for compatible cars
- Track record: 300M+ miles driven by ~20k users; openpilot repo has ~50k GitHub stars
- Company is hiring across product, autonomy, and operations

Why it matters
- Brings Tesla-like ADAS features to many non-Tesla vehicles via an open-source stack
- 360° vision and lane-change support point to a maturing aftermarket autonomy platform
- Expect discussion around safety, regulatory limits (it’s Level 2 driver assistance), and real-world compatibility per model and region

**Discussion Summary**

The discussion centers on the practical advantages of Comma’s openpilot system compared to OEM offerings like Hyundai’s HDA2, Ford’s BlueCruise, or GM’s SuperCruise.

*   **Superior User Experience:** Users consistently rate openpilot higher than stock ADAS because it relies on a Driver Monitoring System (camera-based attention tracking) rather than steering wheel torque sensors. This allows for true hands-free driving regarding the steering wheel, eliminating the "nag" to touch the wheel every few seconds, provided the driver's eyes remain on the road.
*   **The Ecosystem of Forks:** A significant portion of the conversation highlights the value of the open-source software stack. Users recommended "SunnyPilot," a popular community fork that introduces features like "hybrid mode" (allowing the driver to handle gas/brake while the computer steers) and experimental handling for stop signs and red lights.
*   **Performance & Limitations:** While reviews are positive regarding long-distance highway comfort, users discussed edge cases. The "laneless" mode is praised for handling roads where lines are obscured (e.g., by snow) by following other vehicles or tire tracks, though it struggles with pothole avoidance.
*   **Critical Reception:** There was debate regarding a past negative review by Linus Tech Tips; owners in the thread argued that the review did not reflect long-term ownership or the current state of the software.
*   **Safety & Compliance:** Technical comments noted that while the system is open, Comma maintains safety standards by banning devices running "unsafe" forks (those that bypass safety checks) from uploading data to their training servers.
