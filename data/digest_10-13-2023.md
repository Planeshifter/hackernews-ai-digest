EU governments are preparing to approve a controversial bill known as "Chat Control 2.0," which would effectively end private messaging and secure encryption. The proposed regulation would require providers of messaging, email, and chat services to automatically search all private messages and photos for suspicious content and report it to the EU. The EU Council Presidency has suggested a minor concession to search for previously classified Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) initially, with less reliable technology for unknown imagery or conversations to be introduced later. However, critics argue that this proposal would fundamentally compromise secure encryption and invade users' privacy. They also believe that indiscriminate scanning of private communications would violate fundamental rights and fail to target actual criminals. Additionally, opponents warn that pushing criminals to secure, decentralised communication channels could make it even harder to identify and rescue victims of child sexual abuse. The proposal is set to be discussed by ambassadors and potentially adopted by ministers next week.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the implications of the proposed "Chat Control 2.0" bill in the EU. Some users argue that the majority of mass surveillance laws are used for general law enforcement rather than stopping child sexual abuse, making the new regulation unnecessary and potentially invasive. Others criticize the EU's competence in enforcing such laws and express concerns about its impact on privacy and individual rights. One user mentions the corruption of Swedish politicians by an American software company for lobbying purposes. The discussion also touches on the need for hardware-level encryption and the potential need to install Linux on computers to maintain control over encryption methods. Some users highlight the importance of legal protections for privacy, while others argue that proposals to protect privacy are often approved voluntarily. The constitutionality of data retention laws is also brought up, with one user expressing hope that WhatsApp, Signal, and other private messaging providers will resist any ban on end-to-end encryption. The discussion also delves into the backdoor policies of different messaging platforms, with concerns raised about Telegram's default chats not being end-to-end encrypted.

A billionaire-backed network of AI advisers is exerting influence in Washington by funding the salaries of AI fellows in key congressional offices, federal agencies, and think tanks. Open Philanthropy, financed by Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz and his wife Cari Tuna, is behind this effort. The fellows, funded through the Horizon Institute for Public Service, are involved in negotiations that will shape Capitol Hill’s plans to regulate AI. Critics worry that the focus on long-term risks associated with AI may divert attention away from addressing the immediate concerns posed by AI systems, such as bias, misinformation, copyright infringement, and privacy breaches. Additionally, some fear that licensing requirements for advanced AI could favor existing tech giants and entrench their dominance in the industry. The network funded by Open Philanthropy includes affiliated organizations like the RAND Corporation and Georgetown University’s Center for Security and Emerging Technology, which also shape AI policy in Washington.

- User "ssgrn" suggests that billionaire-backed networks are not unique to AI influencing Washington, and mentions the Koch Brothers as another example.
- User "archibaldJ" raises the question of how AI advisors can effectively govern AI when the technology itself decentralizes power and can disrupt traditional political systems. They also mention the role of lobbying and design in AI governance.
- User "hppytgr" comments that AI companies tend to claim that their platforms are closing doors, possibly referring to concerns around monopolistic behavior. They mention OpenAI and Microsoft's collaboration as an example.
- User "jrhnn" makes a cryptic comment, stating "mss ls xpct" without further explanation.
