### U-Net CNN in APL: Exploring Zero-Framework, Zero-Library Machine Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3589246.3595371) | 83 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36256869)

Researchers at Dyalog have explored the U-net architecture for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using the APL notation. They compared the performance and language design for neural network programming in APL against specialized neural network frameworks such as PyTorch. The researchers found that the "from scratch" APL source code was more concise and complete than PyTorch's reference implementation, although more foreign in language design. Despite the naive implementation of Co-dfns and their own code, GPU and CPU performance were within a factor of 2.2-2.4 compared to PyTorch. This suggests significant avenues of exploration for machine learning language design and implementation, inside and outside the APL community.

The discussion on the submission mostly focuses on the implementation and benchmarking of the neural network architecture using APL notation. Several comments point out that the APL implementation is concise and impressive, but the benchmarking results are questionable due to the small batch size used. Others suggest related work in GPU-based array programming, such as Futhark, and wonder about using kdb+. Some members of the discussion share their own experiences implementing backpropagation and finding it helpful to understand the mathematics behind it. Someone else suggests that this research could be useful for ML compiler engineers and suggests reaching out to graduate students for further research.

#### [Submission URL](https://huyenchip.com/2023/04/11/llm-engineering.html#backward_and_forward_compatibility) | 94 points | by [nijfranck](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nijfranck) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36258882)

The use of large language models (LLMs) is on the rise, but productionizing LLM applications can be difficult due to the ambiguous nature of natural languages and the nascent nature of the field. The flexibility in user-defined prompts could lead to silent failures, while the ambiguity in LLMs’ generated responses can lead to ambiguous output formats and inconsistency in user experiences. To mitigate these issues, OpenAI is working to increase their models’ reliability, while some developers accept the ambiguity and build their workflows around it. Prompt engineering using fewshot learning and as much engineering rigor as possible can help make prompt engineering systematic.

The discussion on this submission revolves around potential issues and solutions related to productionizing large language models (LLMs), especially regarding their reliability and consistency in user experience. Some users suggest that OpenAI needs to increase the reliability of their models, while others believe that developers should build their workflows around the ambiguity of LLMs. There are also discussions about backward compatibility and version control of LLMs. Some users argue that changing prompts and pre-processing can affect the results, while others focus on the differences between LLMs that support natural language and those that don't. Users also mention fine-tuning, embedding, and filtering prompts as possible solutions to address issues related to productionization. Additionally, users discuss the importance of testing LLMs on multiple benchmark generation tasks.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/05/24/artificial-brains-are-helping-scientists-study-the-real-thing) | 80 points | by [Jeff_Brown](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Jeff_Brown) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36263105)

The use of artificial neural networks (ANNs) is helping neuroscientists understand the inner workings of the human brain, despite the fact that ANNs are mere cartoons of real brains and fail to capture their complexity. By programming ANNs to identify objects from photographs, neuroscientists have discovered some remarkable similarities in the workings of the human brain compared to the artificial brain. The study of ANNs has also led to discoveries in the human visual and auditory cortex, such as the discovery of a region in the human brain that responds to pictures of food after an ANN trained on image-recognition tasks produced a group of artificial neurons devoted to classifying foodstuffs specifically. Additionally, there is apparent interaction between software and natural biology, with researchers finding it possible to feed brain activity into ANNs.

The submission discusses how artificial neural networks (ANNs) are being used by neuroscientists to understand the human brain, with ANNs being able to identify objects from photographs and discover similarities in the workings of the human brain. The discussion in the comments covers various topics, including debates over whether ANNs truly capture the complexity of the human brain, discussions on the limitations of current research, and arguments over the validity of comparing ANNs to the human brain. Some commenters also touch on the practical applications of this research, such as human speech processing and the development of natural language processing algorithms.

is article as building blocks for programming languages, where Lisp is the foundation on which other languages can be embedded and developed to suit specific problem-solving domains. What makes Lisp unique is its dynamic nature, rich development environment, and compatibility with other languages. This versatility is especially important in the field of AI, where each problem-solving domain has its own ontology and methods. Through embedded programming languages, Lisp facilitates the communication and co-existence of these different viewpoints, allowing for a more comprehensive and flexible approach to building knowledge-based systems.

The discussion about the submission consists of several comments. 

One user, "dly," shares their thoughts on Lisp's structures and functions, highlighting its dynamic nature and compatibility with other languages. They argue that Lisp's versatility is essential in the field of AI, where different domains have their own ontology and approaches.

Another user, "Solvency," expresses cynicism towards Lisp's relevance in today's AI scene, citing human creativity as the key to innovation rather than the language used for programming. 

In response, "klysm" agrees with Solvency, suggesting that the choice of programming language does not matter significantly. Meanwhile, "strng" argues that a recent article demonstrates that many Lisp programmers from the '90s are condescending and wrong in their views that modern AI does not require knowledge graph systems or mainstream computing. 

Lastly, "pstrt" points out that Lisp is not the only language applicable to AI, naming Python, C++, and Rust as other languages that can be used.

#### [Submission URL](https://qbi.uq.edu.au/article/2023/06/covid-19-can-cause-brain-cells-%E2%80%98fuse%E2%80%99) | 45 points | by [belltaco](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belltaco) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36251906)

Researchers at The University of Queensland have found evidence that COVID-19 can cause brain cells to fuse, leading to chronic neurological symptoms. The study showed that the SARS-CoV-2 virus alters the function of the nervous system by causing neurons to undergo a cell fusion process. This causes the neurons to either start firing synchronously or stop functioning altogether. The discovery offers an explanation for persistent neurological effects after a viral infection, suggesting the potential for new treatments for neurological diseases. The research was published in Science Advances.

The discussion on this submission is primarily focused on the viral spike protein (spk) and its potential effects on the brain. One commenter notes that after a neuronal infection with SARS-CoV-2, the spike protein may cause the neurons to fuse, leading to chronic neurological symptoms. Another user argues that the current versions of the COVID-19 vaccines from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson do not have the ability to cause brain injection. Some commenters discuss the potential for new treatments for neurological diseases using this research, while others question the efficacy of mRNA vaccines and their ability to replicate the spike protein produced by the virus. One user notes that the mRNA vaccines do not include the full-length spike protein and do not bind directly to brain cells, while another user corrects some of the scientific terminology used in previous comments. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding the potential effects of the spike protein on the brain and the development of new treatments for neurological symptoms.
