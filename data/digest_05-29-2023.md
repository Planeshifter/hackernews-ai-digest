#### [Submission URL](https://status.internetnz.nz/incidents/gq1c6slz3198) | 181 points | by [rjgray](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rjgray) | [145 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36118856)

InternetNZ has reported an issue with the DNSSEC chain validation for all .nz domains, including .nz, .co.nz, .geek.nz, .gen.nz, .kiwi.nz, and others. The problem was caused by a KSK rollover event affecting .ac.nz which has been expanded to all .nz domains. The issue is expected to resolve over time, however, if a recursive server is still not resolving any of these domains, the validating recursive server cache can be flushed for the relevant zone to pick up the new DNSSEC records and return it to a functioning state. InternetNZ recommends preemptively flushing all .nz zones before the issue occurs.
