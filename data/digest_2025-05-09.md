In an exciting turn of events reminiscent of mythical alchemy, CERN's ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has achieved the transmutation of lead into gold. Before visions of a modern-day gold rush take hold, it's essential to note that this achievement, while groundbreaking, offers only a fleeting glimpse of gold. The process occurs during near-miss collisions of high-energy lead nuclei, generating intense electromagnetic fields capable of knocking out protons and transforming lead into minuscule, temporary quantities of gold nuclei.

The study, published in the Physical Review Journals, sees the ALICE collaboration quantifying this remarkable transformation. While gold has been artifically manufactured before, the detection and analysis by ALICE marks a pioneering approach through photon–nucleus interactions that stem from electromagnetic fields during subatomic encounters—fields particularly potent due to the large number of protons in lead nuclei and the near-light speed at which these collisions occur.

Despite creating gold at a rate of about 89,000 nuclei per second at its LHC point, this thrilling production accounts for a mere 29 picograms over four years of LHC runs, highlighting an almost impossible leap to alchemical dreams of wealth. Gold nuclei, produced from these interactions, quickly disintegrate into protons and neutrons upon formation, remaining far from crafting anything material.

As a testament to progress in nuclear physics, the results not only test theoretical models of electromagnetic dissociation but also hold potential for enhancing the performance of the LHC and future colliders by understanding beam losses. So, while medieval alchemists' ambitions of transmuting metals into gold in pursuit of riches remain unfulfilled, CERN's latest findings bring that gold, albeit ephemeral, into the realm of possibility.

The discussion around CERN's ALICE experiment creating minuscule amounts of gold from lead highlights several key themes:

1. **Scale & Economics**:  
   - The experiment produced **29 picograms of gold over four years** (equivalent to 86 billion nuclei per second), but users humorously calculated this as "$48 trillion trillion per nucleus" to underscore its impracticality for wealth generation.  
   - Comparisons to alchemy scams emerged, with jokes about "investors" and starting a mint, though participants acknowledged the scientific novelty over financial viability.

2. **Historical Context**:  
   - References were made to the **Washington Monument's aluminum cap**, which was once a precious metal before industrial extraction methods made aluminum cheap. This analogy emphasized how material value shifts with production scalability.

3. **Physics & Practicality**:  
   - Discussions noted that the gold nuclei created are unstable and disintegrate immediately, rendering them useless for material use.  
   - A tangent explored **magnetars** and **supernovae** as natural cosmic forges for heavy elements, contrasting human-made methods like particle accelerators.  

4. **Black Hole Speculation**:  
   - Users debated theoretical physics, including whether matter crossing a black hole’s event horizon leads to singularities or "spacetime role-swapping." While lively, this was flagged as speculative, with reminders that singularities remain mathematically inferred, not empirically proven.

5. **Energy Requirements**:  
   - A detailed calculation concluded that producing **1 gram of gold via the LHC method** would require energy equivalent to **boiling all Earth’s oceans**, highlighting the absurd inefficiency. This underscored why the process is scientifically intriguing but economically irrelevant.

**Tone**: The thread blended humor, historical nods, and critical analysis, reflecting admiration for the science while dismissing any alchemical fantasies. Participants emphasized that while the achievement advances nuclear physics, it’s light-years from practical application.

In a groundbreaking move, Amazon has unveiled its latest innovation in warehouse automation: Vulcan robots, designed to tackle the complex task of stowing items. At an event in Dortmund, Germany, the company highlighted Vulcan as their first robotic system with a "genuine sense of touch," set to revolutionize how robots interact with the physical world, particularly in their extensive network of warehouses.

Traditional warehouse robotics has primarily focused on the challenge of picking items—grabbing products from bins for shipment. However, stowing, which involves placing products into storage bins, presents its unique challenges. This new robotic system aims to enhance and potentially replace the role of humans in this labor-intensive process.

The Vulcan system's development reflects Amazon's ambition to optimize warehouse operations both in terms of spatial efficiency and speed. The robots are reported to have achieved a performance speed slightly exceeding that of human workers after having processed more than 500,000 stows in operational settings. The company plans to have Vulcan tackle 80 percent of manual stowing tasks at a pace of 300 items per hour, operating almost continuously.

This innovation aligns with Amazon's strategic goal of streamlining its logistical operations, ultimately aiming to maximize efficiency across its expansive distribution network. The adoption of such advanced robotics signifies a significant shift towards more automated solutions in the e-commerce giant's approach to inventory management. As Vulcan robots continue to be integrated, Amazon's handling capacity and operational throughput may see a transformative improvement, setting a new standard in the industry.

### Write the most clever code you can

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/write-the-most-clever-code-you-possibly-can/) | 14 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43937218)

In the tech community, there's a longstanding debate about crafting "clever code," which usually refers to complex, elegant programming that leverages advanced language features. While simplicity and clarity are often favored, there's a persuasive case for occasionally diving into the realm of clever code. This approach is especially valuable as a form of deliberate practice to skillfully handle complicated code challenges down the line.

Clever coding often involves combining multiple language features to create concise and efficient solutions, much like a "code-golf" exercise, where the goal is to achieve functionality in as few characters as possible. While these practices aren't suitable for production, they offer an invaluable opportunity to push one’s programming limits.

In a recent newsletter, a hacky yet profound idea is proposed—engage with sophisticated, clever code as a learning strategy, but keep it out of production environments. Here’s why:

1. **Skill Development**: Writing complex code forces programmers to engage with unfamiliar concepts and syntax, enhancing their overall language competence. Even if abstract constructs or patterns are seldom used in everyday coding, the exercise enriches understanding of a language's deeper capabilities.

2. **Debugging Experience**: As Brian Kernighan humorously suggests, deciphering one’s own clever code can provide critical debugging practice. This exercises proficiency in diagnosing and resolving issues in complex systems, which is an essential part of any software engineer's toolkit.

3. **Understanding Core Concepts**: Working with clever code isn't just about the final product—it's also about the journey. By tackling sophisticated solutions, programmers get to understand core ideas and how they interlace. This initiative is valuable when you need to apply a specific feature correctly later on.

4. **Preparing for the Unavoidable**: There are times when only a clever solution will do, either due to performance constraints or limitations of the tools at hand. Familiarity with advanced coding approaches means programmers can better navigate these challenging situations.

In conclusion, while clever code shouldn't make it into live systems without thorough consideration and documentation, it’s a potent tool for learning and growth in the ever-evolving world of programming. For those adventurous enough to explore this path, it offers a structured way to expand one’s coding insight, albeit alongside the necessity of maintaining sanity in production environments through simplicity and readability.

The discussion explores diverse perspectives on the role of "clever code" in programming:  

1. **Cultural and Contextual Variability**: One commenter notes that perceptions of clever code (e.g., using ternary operators or complex OOP patterns) can depend on cultural norms, paradigms, and historical context, implying that its value is subjective.  

2. **Practice vs. Practicality**: A contributor argues that while clever code can serve as deliberate practice to hone skills, coworkers might find it unreadable, and simplicity often trumps cleverness in collaborative or production environments. They also critique how formal CS education emphasizes cleverness to the detriment of valuing straightforward solutions.  

3. **Critiques of Over-Complication**: Another user highlights a paradox: even clever code for seemingly "smart" tasks (like prime number generation) can result in unmaintainable or error-prone solutions, undermining its practicality.  

4. **Rejection of Cleverness**: A commenter dismisses the pursuit of cleverness entirely, advocating for clarity. A reply adds nuance, suggesting that concise syntax (e.g., syntactic compression) is not inherently "clever" but a tool for readability when used appropriately.  

**Key Takeaway**: The debate underscores tension between clever code as a learning exercise and its risks in team/production settings. Participants emphasize context—cleverness can expand skills but must be weighed against maintainability, with some distinguishing code *complexity* from syntactic *conciseness*.
