### Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06695) | 54 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38766381)

Researchers have proposed a computational model for studying the mechanism of adaptation in animals. The model, called Evolving Reservoirs for Meta Reinforcement Learning, combines evolution and development to enable lifetime learning in artificial agents. At the evolutionary scale, reservoirs, a type of recurrent neural networks, are evolved with optimized hyperparameters that control macro-level properties such as memory and dynamics. These evolved reservoirs are then used at the developmental scale to facilitate the learning of behavioral policies through reinforcement learning. The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach in diverse challenging tasks, including solving tasks with partial observability, generating oscillatory dynamics for locomotion tasks, and facilitating the generalization of learned behaviors to new tasks. The results highlight the potential of combining reservoirs and reinforcement learning for improving learning capabilities in artificial agents.

The discussion on this submission seems to be quite divided. 

One user with the username "p1esk" questions the need for using randomly initialized transformer blocks as reservoirs in the researched computational model, suggesting that it may not be necessary. 

Another user with the username "dy" expresses difficulty in understanding the paper and criticizes the unclear objectives and experiments presented. 

However, a user with the username "smstv" provides a comprehensive explanation of how the computational model works by combining evolutionary and developmental approaches. They also draw an interesting comparison with Monarch butterflies' multi-generational migration, highlighting the potential of the model in learning and adaptation. 

In response to "smstv's" comment, another user questions if external triggers, such as the presence of specific patterns in the reservoir's genome, could enhance contextual understanding and faster learning. The user also suggests that this approach could be beneficial for GPT-style models. 

Additionally, "smstv" discusses the training of Ferret, a multimodal large language model capable of understanding spatial references with high accuracy. They highlight the model's ability to comprehend spatially complex tasks. 

Lastly, a user shares a link to an image gallery titled "The DHS Department of Entangled Agent Technologies Humanity," which appears to be related to the topic but is not further discussed in the comments.

2023 was a transformative year for AI, with various advancements in image generation, video generation, and text generation. Adobe Firefly and Generative Fill democratized AI, allowing users to create diverse visual content. Midjourney and DALLÂ·E 3 improved image generation capabilities, while Stability AI and HeyGen paved the way for generative video creation. Runway's Gen-2 model enabled easy video generation, and Meta's Pixel Codec Avatars brought us closer to photorealistic telepresence.

In text generation, Google's Bard and Gemini added human-like emotion and sentiment to chatbots, and xAI's Grok showcased rebelliousness and real-time knowledge. OpenAI's GPT-4 now handles image input, generates captions, and supports real-time web browsing. Mistral AI challenged GPT-4 with Mistral 7B and Mixtral 8x7B, emphasizing an open technology approach.

These advancements mark an intermediate stage towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), setting the stage for even more powerful innovations in the future.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to AI and the mentioned advancements. Some users discuss technical aspects, such as the command line options and compatibility of different AI models. Others raise concerns about privacy and the transmission of data to external servers. Some users express their appreciation for the progress in AI, while others caution against the hype and emphasize the need for careful evaluation of models. There is also a discussion about different model architectures and their effectiveness in various applications. Overall, the discussion provides different perspectives and insights into the advancements and implications of AI technology.

### Matter, set to fix smart home standards in 2023, stumbled in the real market

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/12/matter-was-more-of-a-nice-smart-home-concept-than-useful-reality-in-2023/) | 128 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [154 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38763743)

Matter, a smart home standard aimed at reducing fragmentation and improving device compatibility, has been met with mixed reviews. While it promises to make owning a smart home easier and more secure, critics have found that setting up Matter devices and making them work across different home systems can be challenging. Jennifer Pattison Tuohy from The Verge expressed frustration with Matter devices, stating that after a year of testing, she has not been able to get a single Matter-based device to work reliably in her home. Even popular devices like Philips Hue lights have become less usable since being moved to Matter. Additionally, many Matter-compatible devices still require users to download the manufacturer's specific app for full functionality. While the potential of Matter is promising, it seems there is still work to be done to improve its performance and ease of use.

The discussion on Hacker News about Matter, the smart home standard, touches on several points. One user mentions that recurring revenue from closed systems and subscription-based business models could be a problem. Another user praises the support for Home Assistant, which allows direct integration with various sensors and platforms like Google Home and Apple HomeKit. Some users express interest in AirGradient and Air Things Wave+ as alternative devices. The discussion also addresses the confusion surrounding Matter as a standard and the concerns about data collection and privacy in smart homes. Overall, there is a mix of skepticism, praise for certain platforms, and a desire for more user-friendly and open-source solutions.
