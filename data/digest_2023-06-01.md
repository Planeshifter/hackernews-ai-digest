A developer has trained a language model, using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations for Transformers), from scratch on a single desktop PC. The model architecture, tokenizer, and trainer all came from Hugging Face libraries, and it was trained on 20GB of uncompressed text, achieving results comparable to large language models that require clusters of GPUs or TPUs to train. The developer used the code to train the model for four days, fine-tuning it on the GLUE benchmark, and achieved good results after just one epoch. The model's GLUE-dev score was provided, indicating its performance at natural language tasks, and the training results were compared to those achieved by BERT-base.

The discussion covers issues such as the memory and execution time needed for training, the use of GPUs and TPUs to accelerate deep learning, and the relevance of AMD in ML progress. Moreover, the comments also touch upon topics such as the effectiveness of pre-training, the advantages and disadvantages of frameworks, and the limited training time of models.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/01/microsoft-inks-deal-with-coreweave-to-meet-openai-cloud-demand.html) | 47 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36155028)

Microsoft has reportedly agreed to spend potentially billions of dollars over multiple years on cloud computing infrastructure from CoreWeave, a startup that offers Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and rents them out to other companies. The computing power is to ensure that OpenAI, a platform relies on Microsoft's Azure cloud infrastructure for its hefty compute needs and operates the viral ChatGPT chatbot, will have adequate computing power going forward. Nvidia has invested $100m in CoreWeave, which was valued at $2bn in April and which has concurrent financing from hedge fund Magnetar Capital.

The discussion on this submission is centered around CoreWeave's use of GPUs in Ethereum mining and the implications it might have for AI model services. One user points out that mining with consumer-grade GPUs is not ideal for data centers because they cannot support point warranties. Another user suggests that CoreWeave might have converted their mining business into an AI model service business, and mentions that Nvidia's hardware is suitable for both cryptocurrency mining and AI applications. Another user discusses the challenges of integrating software and hardware in building a custom chip. There is also a discussion on whether AI can produce sophisticated responses similar to those produced by humans.

### Measuring the productivity impact of generative AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nber.org/digest/measuring-productivity-impact-generative-ai) | 88 points | by [hhs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hhs) | [100 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36152510)

According to a working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, the productivity of customer support agents increased by nearly 14% after they were given access to a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) AI tool. The tool provided possible responses to customer queries, which agents could choose to use or not. Analysis of call data from roughly 5k agents found that handling more calls per hour increased resolution rates, while satisfaction rates remained stable. Interestingly, less experienced agents and those with lower skillsets benefited the most, improving their performance by 35% with no negative effects on their top-performing peers.

Some users compare it to their own experiences using different programming languages and frameworks, while others express skepticism about the accuracy of such measurements. Other users point out that the GPT AI tool seemed to benefit less experienced agents and those with lower skill sets the most. The discussion then gets into the broader implications of AI in the workplace, with some users expressing concern about the potential impact on skilled workers and the power dynamics in the workplace. Finally, some users suggest that the real issue may be the concentration of power that AI technology allows, and its potential to exacerbate existing inequalities in the workforce.

### Show HN: Word2vec Algorithm in ~100sloc with NumPy

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/JosephSBoyle/skip_gram/blob/346f79ff948ef3d279558a9460c44e7f7598fb7d/skip_gram/main.py) | 68 points | by [extasia](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=extasia) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149620)

This code is a Python implementation of the skip-gram (word2vec) training on Spanish text. It trains a word-to-vector dictionary using the skip-gram algorithm from Mikolov et. al. Some key notes about the implementation include: it uses two embeddings per-word, one when the word is a context and one for when the word is a target; it can represent words as the sum of these two vectors, or simply throw away the context vector and use the target one; and it uses the dot product between two word vectors to represent the similarity between two words. The code also offers a rigorous explanation about the training algorithm. The discussion included topics such as the usefulness of contextual embeddings, the advantages of implementing the code in Jax, and the importance of handling rare words and stop words. One user shared a link to the Gensim package as a golden standard for word2vec modeling.

### SvelteKit with Integrated WebSocket Server

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/suhaildawood/SvelteKit-integrated-WebSocket) | 27 points | by [luu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=luu) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36146800)

Suhail Dawood has updated his SvelteKit with Integrated WebSocket Server project to be compliant with SvelteKit 1.15.7. Despite the stable release not providing out-of-the-box support for WebSocket integration, the project provides a solution by attaching a WebSocket server to the global state. This approach offers co-located server-side code within the SvelteKit project structure, allowing for sharing of utilities, logic and types across the codebase. However, changes made to WebSocket logic require the middleware to be rebuilt and the server to be restarted, temporarily disrupting WebSocket functionality.

In the discussion, users express their opinions about other popular front-end frameworks and back-end frameworks and which one works best for their projects. There is also discussion about the use of InertiaJS and integrating Svelte with Fastify. Some users express concern about using front-end frameworks that are platform-agnostic, while others argue that back-end frameworks will always be necessary. Additionally, there is a conversation about the challenges of working with SvelteKit and maintaining back-end code. Finally, some users discuss their experience using custom servers with frameworks like NextJS and express dissatisfaction with newer versions that make things more complicated.
