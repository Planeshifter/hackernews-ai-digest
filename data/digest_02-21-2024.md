### Encoding tic-tac-toe in 15 bits

#### [Submission URL](https://cbarrick.dev/posts/2024/02/19/tic-tac-toe) | 129 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39456135)

Alejandra González, also known as @blyxyas, recently shared a fascinating blog post on how to encode a tic-tac-toe game state using as few bits as possible. While she managed to compress it into 18 bits, the challenge was to do even better. By representing each cell with a pair of bits (one for a circle, one for a cross), the grid could be encoded using only 15 bits. This clever solution allowed for efficient implementation of core methods like getting and setting cell values using bit manipulation.

However, the quest for optimization didn't stop there. By viewing the game state as a base-3 number and each cell as a digit in base-3, it was possible to further reduce the memory usage to 16 bits. This approach required rethinking the methods to work with base-3 digits and involved a bit more complexity compared to the base-4 representation. Ultimately, the choice between the two representations depended on specific needs, with the base-4 option offering better CPU performance due to simpler operations.

While the base-3 representation might not be a common choice for most applications, it could offer significant memory savings in scenarios requiring storage of a vast number of uncompressed game states. This exercise in optimization showcases the creativity and thought process involved in finding efficient solutions, even if they might seem like a wild case of premature optimization at first glance.
