#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/dartmouth-ai-workshop) | 166 points | by [fremden](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fremden) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37469849)

In a guest article for IEEE Spectrum, Grace Solomonoff explores the story behind a group photo taken at the 1956 Dartmouth AI workshop, a milestone event that marked the beginning of AI as a research discipline. The photo captured seven of the workshop's main participants, but one person remained unidentified for years. After thorough research and the discovery of a letter among Ray Solomonoff's papers, it was revealed that the unknown person was Peter Milner, who attended the workshop alongside other influential figures like John McCarthy, Marvin Minsky, Claude Shannon, and Nathaniel Rochester. The revelation helps complete the historical narrative of that significant event.

The discussion among Hacker News commenters covers a wide range of topics related to the submission. Some commenters provide personal anecdotes about their experiences with AI, while others discuss the limitations and capabilities of current AI systems. One commenter, "trd hardI," shares their experience studying AI in the 1980s and criticizes the problem-solving approach used at Stanford University during that time. They argue that focusing on formalizing problem spaces hindered progress in machine learning and that the field only started to make significant advancements in the past 15 years. "ggm" adds to the discussion by sharing their memories of the 1956 Dartmouth AI workshop and their interactions with influential figures like Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy. They also mention McCarthy's involvement in Usenet discussions and his controversial posts. "jhndh" mentions that their father and friends were computer scientists working in AI back in the 1960s and that the path to popular AI systems today has not been straightforward. Other commenters, like "fnrdpglt," discuss the current state of AI, specifically the capabilities of language models like GPT-3. They argue that while these models display impressive abilities in certain areas, they have limitations in understanding complex semantic spaces and often rely on flawed reasoning. The discussion also touches on topics like deductive and inductive reasoning, the definition of a computer, and the distinction between abductive and inductive reasoning. Overall, the conversation ranges from personal experiences to technical aspects of AI and its limitations.

### Atari doubles down on retro, buys beloved Atari homebrew maker

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/zap-atari-acquires-beloved-retro-homebrew-vendor-atariage/) | 42 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464250)

In a surprising move, Atari has announced its acquisition of AtariAge, an online community for Atari enthusiasts that has been around for over two decades. AtariAge is known for selling high-quality cartridge versions of Atari 2600, 5200, and 7800 console homebrews, as well as games for Atari computers and other retro systems. The founder of AtariAge, Albert Yarusso, will join Atari in a full-time role and continue running AtariAge as usual. However, he will focus on updating the site's games database. Despite being a different entity from the original Atari, the new Atari has been leaning heavily on its retro heritage, publishing new Atari 2600 games on cartridges and releasing a new console called the Atari 2600+. The acquisition of AtariAge makes sense as it aligns with Atari's strategy of leveraging its retro IP. Atari CEO Wade Rosen expressed the importance of AtariAge's community and plans to support its mission for years to come. While some members of the AtariAge community have expressed concerns about corporate interference, Yarusso reassured them that the acquisition will not result in changes to the forums or censorship of critical posts. On the positive side, the acquisition opens opportunities for AtariAge's homebrew game creators, who may now have the chance to have their games published on Atari's platforms. Overall, the acquisition of AtariAge shows that Atari is serious about its retro-related IP and aims to create new hardware and software based on it.

### FBI, Fed Judge: Fighting Botnets Means Allowing FBI Remote Installs on Computers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/09/11/fbi-federal-judge-agree-fighting-botnets-means-allowing-the-fbi-to-remotely-install-software-on-peoples-computers/) | 44 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37472841)

In a recent operation to take down a major component of the cybercrime ecosystem, the FBI remotely installed software on over 700,000 computers around the world without notifying the victims. The operation was authorized by a court warrant and aimed to disrupt a botnet known as Qakbot. While disrupting botnets is generally seen as a public good, concerns arise about the potential invasion of privacy and abuse of power. The warrant allowed the FBI to search and seize information from any computer it sent its software to. It is unclear how the FBI determined which computers were infected, as the warrant seems to authorize an intrusion into all accessible computers. The only limitation mentioned in the warrant is that it does not authorize the seizure of any tangible property or alteration of functionality. This operation raises questions about the extent to which the government can coerce content moderation decisions and the means by which it can do so.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the recent operation conducted by the FBI to take down the Qakbot botnet. Users express concerns about the potential invasion of privacy and abuse of power that could result from the FBI remotely installing software on over 700,000 computers without notifying the victims. Some users argue that the FBI should have disclosed the existence of any 0-day vulnerabilities used in the operation, while others highlight the need for effective law enforcement. There is also a debate about the legality and oversight of such operations, with one user questioning if foreign intelligence agencies are acting illegally domestically. Another user raises concerns about the compromised computers becoming part of a shady hacker collective. Some users discuss the FBI's preference for Linux systems over Windows, and there is a general sentiment of fear and distrust towards the power and secrecy of federal agencies.

### Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/windows-system-components-default-edge.html) | 733 points | by [extr0pian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=extr0pian) | [436 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461449)

The recent blog post from Microsoft announcing that Windows system components would start respecting the default web browser setting has caused confusion among users. While many in the tech media celebrated this as a win for users, Daniel Aleksandersen, who developed the open-source EdgeDeflector program, has conducted extensive testing and found no changes in the new Windows Insider version. Despite the highlight in the changelog suggesting that Microsoft had caved to pressure from the European Union, Aleksandersen's findings indicate that Windows 11 still strongly discourages changing the default browser away from Microsoft Edge. Web links continue to force-open in Microsoft Edge rather than the user's default browser. Microsoft has not publicly clarified the changes or responded to requests for comment, leading to speculation that the assumed changes may be a gradual rollout. Despite the lack of confirmation, the story has received significant positive press attention.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around several different topics. 

One user highlights the surprise and confusion regarding the recent changes to Windows system components respecting the default web browser setting. They mention Paul Thurrott's article about the issue and speculate that the changes may not have been fully implemented in the new Windows Insider version.
Another user brings up the past instances of Microsoft's behavior regarding default browser settings, mentioning cases from Windows 7 and Windows 98. They argue that Microsoft's actions have previously been driven by non-competitive behavior.
There is a discussion about the reluctance of governments to regulate non-competitive behavior in the tech industry, with one user specifically mentioning the EU's regulations and another user referring to the military-industrial complex in the US.
Some users express frustration with Microsoft and their integration of certain products, mentioning forced installations and the lack of options to disable or switch to alternatives.
The conversation then shifts to a broader discussion about the influence of big business and the manipulation of public discourse. There are also mentions of the catch-22 situation of criticism against billionaires and the difficulty of confronting those with power and influence.
There is a brief discussion about the EU's willingness to regulate non-competitive behavior and the need for laws that promote competition and benefit consumers.
One user expresses dissatisfaction with Microsoft's practices, stating that they find it inconvenient to be forced to use certain products, while another user argues that the integration of certain software can have practical benefits.
The discussion then touches on the topic of tightly integrated software and its pros and cons. Examples are given of various platforms and their level of integration, with some users arguing that tightly integrated software can be beneficial, while others argue that it can be messy and limiting.
The conversation ends with a user discussing the need for controls on integrations and the potential issues that can arise from undocumented APIs and non-competitive practices.
