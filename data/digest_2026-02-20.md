### Ggml.ai joins Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759) | 786 points | by [lairv](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lairv) | [206 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47088037)

Headline: ggml.ai (team behind llama.cpp) joins Hugging Face to power the next phase of Local AI

What happened:
- Georgi Gerganov and the ggml.ai team are joining Hugging Face while continuing to lead and maintain ggml and llama.cpp full-time.
- The projects remain 100% open source and community-driven; technical decisions stay with the existing maintainers.
- Hugging Face will provide long-term resources to sustain and grow the ecosystem.

Why it matters:
- llama.cpp and the GGUF ecosystem have become a backbone for running powerful models locally on consumer hardware. This move shores up sustainability and accelerates support for new models and quantizations.
- It formalizes a productive collaboration: HF engineers have already contributed core features, multimodal support, an inference server/UI, additional architectures, GGUF compatibility, and integrations with HF Inference Endpoints.

What to expect next:
- Tighter, near “single-click” integration between transformers and ggml/llama.cpp for broader model coverage and easier validation.
- Better packaging and UX to make local model deployment simpler and more ubiquitous.
- Faster turnaround for new model support and quant releases.

Bigger picture:
- This is a clear bet on local inference as a serious alternative to cloud AI, aiming to build an efficient, open inference stack across devices—framed by both teams as a step toward widely accessible, open-source “superintelligence.”

Impact for developers and users:
- Smoother pipelines from transformers to GGUF/llama.cpp.
- Improved tooling and installers for desktop/server setups.
- Continued openness and community autonomy, with added stability and resourcing from HF.

Open questions to watch:
- Details of governance and roadmap prioritization under the new arrangement.
- How quickly new architectures and multimodal features flow through transformers → GGUF → llama.cpp.

Here is the daily digest summary for this submission and the accompanying discussion.

### **Top Story: ggml.ai (llama.cpp) joins Hugging Face**

**The Gist**
Georgi Gerganov and the team behind **ggml.ai** (the creators of **llama.cpp** and the **GGUF** file format) differ joining **Hugging Face**. The team will continue to work on their projects full-time with a commitment to keeping them 100% open-source and maintaining independent decision-making. Hugging Face is stepping in to provide the long-term resources and infrastructure needed to sustain the ecosystem.

**Why it Matters**
This consolidates the "local AI" stack. `llama.cpp` has become the standard for running LLMs on consumer hardware (MacBooks, gaming PCs, etc.). By officially aligning with Hugging Face, users can expect a seamless pipeline where new models uploaded to HF are immediately compatible with local inference tools (GGUF), along with faster support for new architectures and easier "one-click" deployment options.

### **Hacker News Discussion Summary**

The discussion on Hacker News focused heavily on the logistics of local AI, the sustainability of Hugging Face, and the technical nuance of quantization.

*   **Hugging Face as the "Real" OpenAI:** Commenters praised Hugging Face as the true champion of open-source AI, noting the immense, likely expensive service they provide by hosting petabytes of model weights for free. Several users expressed hope that HF has a sustainable business model so this resource doesn't disappear.
*   **The "Data Cap" Bottleneck:** A significant portion of the thread revolved around the practical struggles of local AI enthusiasts. Users reported downloading terabytes of models per week, triggering data caps from residential ISPs (like Comcast and AT&T). This led to a debate on why Hugging Face doesn't utilize **BitTorrent** to offload bandwidth costs. The counter-argument was that HF likely avoids torrents to maintain accurate download metrics (vanity metrics) and to manage access control for "gated" models (like Llama 3).
*   **Quantization Quality Control:** There was a technical exchange (involving Daniel Han of Unsloth) regarding the reliability of quantized models. Users expressed concern that aggressive quantization "lobotomizes" models in ways that are hard to detect with standard benchmarks (like perplexity). The consensus was that running comprehensive benchmarks on every quantization format is currently too expensive ($1k–$100k) for most open-source maintainers.
*   **East vs. West Open Weights:** A debate emerged regarding the quality of Western open models (like Mistral) versus Chinese open models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi). Some users argued that Chinese models are currently winning on efficiency and reasoning benchmarks, while others countered that they still lack Western cultural knowledge and nuance required for tasks like creative writing or roleplay.

### Every company building your AI assistant is now an ad company

#### [Submission URL](https://juno-labs.com/blogs/every-company-building-your-ai-assistant-is-an-ad-company) | 258 points | by [ajuhasz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ajuhasz) | [135 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092203)

Juno opens pre-orders for a local, always-on AI assistant—and argues ads make rival assistants a surveillance risk

- The pitch: Adam Juhasz says the next wave of assistants must be “always on”—hearing and seeing context across rooms, wearables, and time—to be truly proactive. Wake words are a dead end because the most valuable context happens in natural, unprompted conversations.

- The clash: He argues nearly every major assistant effort is now ad-funded, creating structural incentives to capture and monetize continuous audio/visual data. Policies can change; architectures can’t. “Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.”

- The remedy: Keep inference local. If models run on-device/in-home, there’s no API to hit, no telemetry to harvest, no data to subpoena. He cites Amazon’s Alexa/Ring histories as cautionary tales and notes OpenAI’s recent move to ads as a sign of where cloud-first models trend.

- Tech claim: The edge stack is “ready now.” A small, fanless box can run real-time STT, memory, reasoning, and TTS with acceptable quality for home tasks. Remaining issues are framed as memory architecture and context handling, not model size.

- The product: Juno’s Pioneer Edition—positioned as a local-first, always-listening home assistant—opens for pre-orders. The post doubles as a manifesto for on-device AI over ad-backed cloud assistants.

Why it matters: If “ambient AI” is inevitable, the business model and deployment architecture will decide who controls the feed from your life—users or advertisers. This piece argues a new category—local AI appliances—may be the only trustworthy path.

**The Discussion**
The comment thread centers on the tension between Juno’s privacy promises and the inherent risks of "always-on" recording, with the creator (`jhsz`) actively addressing technical concerns.

*   **Legal & Physical Risks:** Users argued that "local-only" does not equal "immune to law enforcement." Commenters like `zmmmmm` and `pxys` noted that unless the device is legally and technically resistant to compelled decryption (e.g., warrants), a box full of intimate family conversations is a liability. There were also concerns about what happens if the hardware is stolen or if Juno is acquired by a data-hungry conglomerate.
*   **The Creator's Defense:** `jhsz` engaged with critics, explaining that the system is designed to minimize long-term raw data storage (tuning memory to extract facts and "forget" the audio quickly) and relies on hardware-encrypted storage (Nvidia Jetson). They argued that while no solution is magical, data "inside the walls" is fundamentally safer than data in a corporate cloud.
*   **Target Audience Mismatch:** Several users (`BoxFour`, `bndrm`) pointed out a contraction in the pitch: the specific demographic that cares enough about privacy to buy a local AI appliance is often the same demographic that refuses to have *any* always-on microphones in their home, regardless of architecture.
*   **Philosophical Pushback:** The debate extended to the utility of "perfect memory." Citing Borges’ *Funes the Memorious*, some users questioned whether an AI that remembers every interaction is a helpful tool or a dystopian burden, suggesting that human forgetfulness is a feature, not a bug.

### The path to ubiquitous AI (17k tokens/sec)

#### [Submission URL](https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/) | 791 points | by [sidnarsipur](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sidnarsipur) | [429 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47086181)

Taalas: turning models into chips for 10x faster, cheaper inference; launches hard‑wired Llama 3.1 8B at 17K tok/s

What’s new
- Taalas claims it can convert any AI model into custom silicon in ~2 months, producing “Hardcore Models” that are ~10x faster, ~20x cheaper to build, and ~10x lower power than GPU-based inference.
- First product: HC1 chip hard‑wiring Llama 3.1 8B, offered as a chatbot and inference API. Claimed performance: 17,000 tokens/sec per user (1k/1k input/output), outpacing Nvidia H200/B200 baselines and specialist stacks (Groq, SambaNova, Cerebras) in their chart.
- Design philosophy:
  - Total specialization: per‑model ASICs for maximum efficiency.
  - Merge storage and compute: single chip at DRAM‑level density to eliminate HBM, massive I/O, advanced packaging, liquid cooling.
  - Radical simplification: simpler systems = much lower total cost.
- Flexibility: configurable context window; supports fine‑tuning via LoRA. Gen‑1 uses aggressive 3‑/6‑bit quantization (some quality hit). Gen‑2 (HC2) moves to standard 4‑bit floating point with higher density/speed.
- Roadmap: mid‑sized reasoning LLM on HC1 this spring; “frontier” LLM on HC2 targeted for winter.

Why it matters
- If these numbers hold up, inference latency and cost could drop by an order of magnitude—key for real‑time agents and large‑scale deployment without ballooning data centers.
- It’s a bolder bet than general accelerators (e.g., Groq, Cerebras): a per‑model ASIC pipeline that trades flexibility for speed/efficiency, mitigated by a fast 2‑month turnaround and LoRA support.

Caveats/questions
- “Compute + DRAM‑density storage on one chip without exotic tech” is a big claim; details on process, concurrency, and memory architecture are sparse.
- Hard‑wiring weights risks rapid obsolescence as models evolve; economics hinge on how often new ASICs are spun and how broadly each model is adopted.
- Benchmark framing (tokens/sec per user, aggressive quantization) may mask throughput/quality trade‑offs; quality metrics vs GPU baselines aren’t shown.

How to try
- A beta chatbot demo and inference API for the HC1 Llama 3.1 8B are live.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Technical Speculation & Credibility**
*   Commenters analyzed the likely architecture, theorizing that Taalas is using specialized "mask ROM" fabrication where weights are stored via physical transistor traits (e.g., drive strength) rather than traditional memory cells. This enables single-transistor, 4-bit multiplication and massive density on mature nodes like TSMC 6nm.
*   While some were skeptical of the claimed 2-month "tape-out" turnaround, others noted the founders’ pedigree (veterans from Nvidia, AMD, and Tenstorrent), suggesting they have the specific expertise and connections to pull off such complex VLSI feats.

**Performance vs. The Status Quo**
*   Users distinguished Taalas’s metrics from Nvidia’s. While an H200 serves high throughput via massive batching (high latency per user), Taalas appears to offer massive throughput at very low latency (milliseconds) for single users.
*   The 17k tokens/second speed was described as a legitimate "quantitative change leading to a qualitative change," enabling real-time voice, video generation, and agentic workflows that current GPUs cannot handle efficiently.

**Strategic Use Cases: Speculative Decoding**
*   A significant portion of the debate focused on using these chips for **speculative decoding**. Instead of just being a standalone chatbot, the Taalas chip could serve as a "draft model" to rapidly generate tokens that are then verified by a larger frontier model, significantly speeding up the total inference of massive models.
*   Caveats were raised regarding tokenizer compatibility and whether the rigid nature of hard-wired chips allows them to pair effectively with evolving frontier models in this way.

**Risks & Environmental Concerns**
*   **Obsolescence:** The primary economic concern is whether a model remains relevant long enough to justify a dedicated hardware run. However, some argued that specific domains (robotics, control systems, basic coding) are stable enough to benefit from frozen, highly efficient models.
*   **E-waste:** Critics worried about the environmental impact of manufacturing chips that become useless once the model weights are outdated, comparing them to single-purpose ASIC miners or disposable tech.

### Pi for Excel: AI sidebar add-in for Excel

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/tmustier/pi-for-excel) | 104 points | by [rahimnathwani](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rahimnathwani) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47082854)

Pi for Excel: an open-source, multi-model AI sidebar that can read and edit your spreadsheets

What it is
- A Microsoft Excel add-in that embeds an AI agent directly in a sidebar. It can read your workbook, make changes, explain formulas, search the web, and run task-specific “skills.”
- Bring-your-own model: works with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You can switch models mid-conversation.
- MIT-licensed. Repo: https://github.com/tmustier/pi-for-excel — Demo/site: https://pi-for-excel.vercel.app

Why it’s interesting
- Deep Excel tooling: 16 built-in actions the AI can call, including read/write ranges, fill formulas, trace dependencies, explain formulas, search across sheets, modify structure, apply formatting, manage comments, and even restore from automatic backups.
- Auto-context: before each turn the model gets a blueprint of your workbook, your current selection, and recent edits—so you don’t have to describe what you’re looking at.
- Safety and control: write operations have overwrite protection and auto-verification, with one-click revert via checkpoints.
- Extensible: install sandboxed sidebar extensions the AI can generate for you; integrates optional web search (Serper/Tavily/Brave) and an MCP gateway to connect custom tools.
- Power-user extras (behind /experimental): tmux bridge for local terminal control, Python/LibreOffice bridge, external skills discovery, stricter extension permissions.

How to use
- Install by sideloading the manifest (macOS and Windows instructions in the README). Click “Open Pi” in Excel’s ribbon.
- Connect a provider via API key or OAuth, or point it at a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway.
- Try prompts like “What sheets do I have?” or “Summarize my current selection,” then ask it to fill formulas or format ranges per your house style.

Dev setup
- Node 20 + mkcert for local HTTPS (Office.js requirement), Vite dev server, sideload the dev manifest. Quick-start steps are in the repo.

Caveats
- As with any LLM-powered Excel agent, workbook data you share may be sent to your chosen model/provider. Good fit if you want Copilot-like assistance but prefer open-source and BYO keys.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

*   **Origins and Inspiration:** The author (`tmstr`) joined the thread to explain that the project was built to bring the spirit of the open-source coding agent **Pia** to Excel. They noted that the tool uses a virtual filesystem and wraps specific "skills" to interact with the spreadsheet.
*   **Web Compatibility:** Users confirmed the add-in works on the web version of Excel (allowing use on Linux), provided the manifest is sideloaded via localhost. However, users noted that sideloaded dev-mode add-ins typically disappear after a week.
*   **Technical Constraints:** There was discussion regarding context window limits when handling large datasets. The author acknowledged that large tables currently overflow the context when passing results to the LLM, but mentioned optimizations and a potential Python bridge to handle larger sheets in the future.
*   **Deployment Headaches:** While users praised the modern Office JS API for functionality, several lamented the distribution process, describing the MS App Store and side-loading requirements as significant hurdles compared to the actual coding.
*   **Action vs. Text:** Users verified that the agent can perform functional tasks—such as creating charts and formatting tables—rather than just answering questions, with one user comparing the desired utility to an AI graphic designer that performs steps in Photoshop.
*   **Risks:** One user warned about API bans, claiming their Google account was banned after 48 hours of heavy usage with a similar tool, highlighting the risks of hitting consumer AI endpoints with automated tasks.

### Consistency diffusion language models: Up to 14x faster, no quality loss

#### [Submission URL](https://www.together.ai/blog/consistency-diffusion-language-models) | 215 points | by [zagwdt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zagwdt) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47083648)

Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) promise big speed gains for diffusion LMs without hurting quality. The team from SNU, UC Berkeley, and Together AI reports up to 14.5x lower latency on math and coding tasks by making diffusion decoding both more parallel and cache-friendly.

Why this matters
- Diffusion LMs refine masked text over multiple steps and can finalize multiple tokens per iteration, but in practice they’re slow: full bidirectional attention blocks KV caching, and many refinement steps are needed for quality.
- CDLM tackles both, pushing diffusion LMs closer to practical, high-throughput deployment while keeping their advantages (bidirectional context, infilling, refinement).

What’s new
- Exact block-wise KV caching for diffusion LMs: Train a student with a block-causal mask (attends to prompt, prior blocks, and current block) distilled from a fully bidirectional teacher. This preserves quality while enabling standard KV reuse for finished blocks.
- Reliable multi-token finalization: Within each block, the model confidently finalizes several tokens in parallel, reducing the number of refinement steps without degrading output.

How it works (post-training recipe)
- Trajectory collection: Run a strong bidirectional DLM as teacher to record token-by-token refinement trajectories and hidden states under a conservative setup (e.g., 256-token generations in blocks of 32, one token finalized per step) to capture high-quality signals.
- Train a block-causal student with three losses:
  - Distillation on newly unmasked tokens (match teacher’s reconstructed distributions).
  - Consistency on still-masked tokens (align intermediate predictions with block-complete predictions via stop-gradient).
  - Auxiliary masked-denoising (retain general masked-token and reasoning ability).
- Inference: Decode block-wise autoregressively with exact KV reuse for prompt and finished blocks; within a block, finalize tokens in parallel using a confidence threshold; early stop on EOS.

Results
- On Dream-7B-Instruct (a diffusion LM), CDLM achieves up to 14.5x latency speedups on math/coding benchmarks with comparable quality, using far fewer refinement steps.
- No extra heuristic knobs required; the gains come from the caching-compatible mask plus consistency-based multi-token finalization.

Takeaway
CDLM is a clean, post-training path to make diffusion language models fast enough to compete with autoregressive LMs in interactive settings—keeping diffusion’s bidirectional strengths while unlocking KV caching and parallel token finalization. Caveats to watch: the need for offline teacher trajectories and how well gains generalize beyond math/coding and the tested model size.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Technical Mechanisms and "Drafting" vs. Autoregression**
Users discussed the fundamental differences between Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) and standard Autoregressive (AR) models. `bpp` and others used analogies (referencing "British munchkin cats" and "inserting a refrigerator into a kitchen") to illustrate how diffusion models handle global context. Unlike AR models that generate tokens linearly (left-to-right), diffusion models treat text generation more like editing a draft—modeling the probability of the entire output structure simultaneously. This allows for infilling and correcting "invalid" structures that AR models struggle with. There was brief debate regarding hybrid AR+Diffusion models (citing LLaDA), with some analyzing whether combining them risks losing the reasoning benefits of pure diffusion.

**Model Sizing, Efficiency, and Data Quality**
The conversation shifted significantly when `MASNeo` expressed a desire for researchers to build larger models. `wngrs` and others countered that frontier models likely haven't grown substantially in parameter size over the last year or two. Instead, the industry focus has shifted to efficiency and data quality. `mgclhpp` cited technical reports from Qwen, noting that cleaner training data and longer pre-training allow smaller models (e.g., Qwen 2.5/3) to rival or outperform older, larger models. Users suggested the industry is moving toward "density" and "singularity"—highly efficient, smaller models correcting each other in parallel, rather than monolithic giants.

**Pricing Conspiracies and "Enshittification"**
A thread of skepticism emerged regarding the business practices of major AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). Users speculated that the lack of public parameter counts allows companies to maintain high pricing tiers ($20-$200/month) while actually serving cheaper, optimized models. `rthmsthms` and `bdbdbdb` argued that speed improvements often look suspiciously like "rebranded" models or silent downgrades to cut compute costs (enshittification), effectively keeping margins high while technological costs drop. Specific grievances were aired regarding the pricing and performance confusing between versions like Claude Sonnet 3.5 vs. 3.6 and Opus.

### Nvidia and OpenAI abandon unfinished $100B deal in favour of $30B investment

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ft.com/content/dea24046-0a73-40b2-8246-5ac7b7a54323) | 294 points | by [zerosizedweasle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zerosizedweasle) | [325 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47086980)

Nvidia and OpenAI reportedly ditch $100B mega-deal, pivot to $30B investment

What happened
- The Financial Times reports that Nvidia and OpenAI have abandoned an unfinished deal said to be worth around $100 billion, opting instead for a roughly $30 billion investment. The detailed terms aren’t public.

Why it matters
- A move from a single, gigantic commitment to a smaller one suggests both sides prefer staged, flexible financing and capacity build-out over an all-in mega arrangement.
- It could temper near-term expectations for OpenAI’s dedicated compute scale-up and keep Nvidia’s options open on who gets priority access to its next-gen GPUs.
- The shift may also reflect practical constraints (supply chains, regulatory scrutiny, financing costs) and a desire to avoid heavy concentration risk.

What to watch
- How the $30B is structured (equity stake, JV, supply pre-pays, or a mix).
- Any exclusivity or priority-allocation clauses for Nvidia hardware.
- Knock-on effects for OpenAI’s cloud partnerships and training timelines.
- Whether other financiers or hyperscalers step in to fill the gap.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the community's reaction:

**OpenAI’s "WeWork Moment" and the IPO Rush**
Much of the conversation draws a sharp comparison between OpenAI and WeWork. Commenters suggest OpenAI (and Anthropic) may be rushing toward an IPO to capitalize on "unlimited AI hype" before the market scrutinizes their lack of a clear path to profitability. Users expressed skepticism about the company's cost structure, viewing the pivot to a smaller investment deal as a potential signal that the "blind check" era of funding is ending.

**Nvidia: Enron, Cisco, or Just a Cyclical Bust?**
Speculation regarding Nvidia’s future was polarized. Some questioned if Nvidia could become "Enron 2.0" (referencing fraud), though this was largely dismissed because Nvidia sells tangible, high-demand hardware. A more popular comparison was Cisco or Sun Microsystems during the Dotcom boom—highly profitable companies that faced a massive correction when the bubble burst. There was debate over whether Nvidia could easily pivot back to selling GPUs to gamers if enterprise demand dries up, with some arguing that retreating from high-margin datacenter chips would be a painful restructuring.

**Tangible Assets vs. Model Weights**
A sub-thread contrasted OpenAI with SpaceX. Participants noted that SpaceX has tangible assets (rockets, Starlink satellites, launch infrastructure) and a clear moat, whereas OpenAI faces high operating costs with a product (LLMs) that some view as lacking the same defensive "hard tech" barriers.

**Hype Fatigue and Skepticism**
Calculated skepticism regarding AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is growing. Commenters noted that aggressive predictions about AI replacing white-collar work or programmers by 2024/2025 are already "aging like milk." Citations regarding Ed Zitron (a tech critic who predicted investment scale-backs) were shared, suggesting that while the technology is useful, the financial expectations attached to it may be decoupling from reality.

### 'A Big Fuck You to Big Tech': New Jersey Residents Defeat AI Data Center

#### [Submission URL](https://www.commondreams.org/news/new-brunswick-ai-data-center) | 53 points | by [abdelhousni](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=abdelhousni) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47094179)

Headline: New Jersey city kills AI data center, chooses public park instead

Summary: The New Brunswick, NJ City Council voted to cancel a planned 27,000-square-foot AI data center at 100 Jersey Ave and will add a public park to a redevelopment that already includes 600 apartments (10% affordable) and small-business warehouses. Hundreds packed the meeting to oppose the project, citing fears of higher electricity and water bills and environmental impacts. Local groups, including the NAACP, argued the facility would drain community resources. After the vote, residents celebrated; organizers framed the decision as prioritizing neighborhoods over Big Tech.

Why it matters:
- Signals rising local pushback to AI infrastructure over energy and water use, grid strain, and limited community benefits.
- May push data center developers toward stronger community benefit agreements, better transparency on resource use, and siting in areas with surplus power/water or on-site renewables.
- Highlights tension between tech-driven development, housing affordability, and public amenities.

What to watch:
- Whether developers appeal or relocate, and if future proposals include stronger environmental mitigations or utility guarantees.
- If other municipalities adopt stricter zoning or disclosure requirements for AI/data center projects.
- How New Brunswick funds and executes the park addition alongside the broader redevelopment.

Source: Common Dreams (Brett Wilkins), Feb 20, 2026.

**The Discussion**

The Hacker News discussion moves beyond New Brunswick's specific decision to a broader critique of the technology sector's relationship with the public and the power grid.

*   **Tech Fatigue:** Several users expressed that "Big Tech" has lost the "cool" factor it possessed during the 90s and 2000s (likening the old vibe to "sk8erboi culture"). Commenters described current tech giants as "soulless," "sanitized," and overly integrated into daily life, viewing them now as "the establishment" rather than exciting innovators.
*   **Data Center Value:** Participants debated the local value of data centers, describing them as "big ugly boxes" that employ few people compared to the space they occupy. One user contrasted them with nuclear plants which, despite risks, historically evoked a sense of national industrial pride that server farms lack.
*   **The Energy Dilemma:** A significant portion of the thread focused on whether cities could leverage data center demand to fund new power infrastructure (solar, battery, or nuclear) rather than banning them.
    *   **Skepticism of Commitments:** Critics argued that even if cities demand new power generation as a prerequisite, "energy is fungible" and corporations will use legal loopholes, subsidiaries, or financial derivatives to avoid delivering actual local capacity while still causing grid congestion.
    *   **Implementation Issues:** Others noted that solar requires expensive battery storage to be viable for 24/7 uptime and nuclear takes 15+ years to build, leading to fears that companies will simply revert to gas turbines or result in costs being "dumped onto regular people."
    *   **Regulatory Solutions:** Ideas were floated to strictly regulate business power rates or use performance bonds (seized if timelines aren't met) to enforce infrastructure promises, though skeptics maintained that a "blanket refusal" is often the only safe move for a municipality.
