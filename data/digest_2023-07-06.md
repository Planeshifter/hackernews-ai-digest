### AI agents that “self-reflect” perform better in changing environments

#### [Submission URL](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-agents-self-reflect-perform-better-changing-environments) | 204 points | by [chdoyle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chdoyle) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36622959)

Researchers at Stanford have developed a training method called "curious replay" that helps AI agents explore and adapt to new environments. The method is based on the way animals naturally excel at exploring and adapting to their surroundings. In experiments, an AI agent and a mouse were put in separate environments with a red ball. The mouse quickly approached and interacted with the ball, while the AI agent didn't notice it. Adding the "curious replay" training method improved the AI agent's performance and ability to engage with the ball. The method has potential applications in various fields, from robotics to personalized learning tools.

The discussion on this submission has covered a range of topics related to the "curious replay" training method for AI agents. Some users have discussed the details and potential applications of the method, while others have expressed skepticism or confusion about certain aspects. One user questioned the efficiency of AI processing and commented on the need for AI to replicate Eureka moments. Another user mentioned the importance of exploration in reinforcement learning and the trade-offs involved. The concept of "curious replay" and its benefits were also discussed. Some users debated the use of provocative or misleading titles in news articles, while others shared relevant links and resources. The discussion also veered into topics such as self-reflection, rationality, and the similarities between AI and human cognitive processes.

### GPT-4 API General Availability

OpenAI has announced the general availability of the GPT-4 API for all paying customers. This highly capable model has been eagerly anticipated by developers, and millions of requests for access have been made since March. Alongside GPT-4, OpenAI is also making the GPT-3.5 Turbo, DALL·E, and Whisper APIs generally available. However, OpenAI is now recommending that users transition from the older Completions API to the newer Chat Completions API, as it provides better results with a more structured prompt interface. The Chat Completions API accounts for 97% of API usage and enables developers to build conversational experiences and a wide range of completion tasks. To optimize compute capacity and focus on the Chat Completions API, OpenAI plans to retire older models in the Completions API beginning in January 2024. Users will be required to upgrade their integration to the recommended models or specify the new models in API requests.

### My small, no name company has lost its mind with AI

Story: A software engineer at a small, unknown company shared their frustration on Blind about their CEO's obsession with AI. The company's CEO views AI as a magical solution that will fix all their problems, while the managers have jumped on the hype train to please him. The engineer described various misguided attempts to implement AI, including using ChatGPT to write JIRA tickets and acceptance criteria, generating HR documents without legal checks, and feeding proprietary information into ChatGPT without concerns. The engineer believes that the company's reliance on AI is a desperate attempt to solve long-standing issues with documentation, code quality, and requirements clarity. They also expressed concerns about the future if even small companies are behaving this way.

The discussion on Hacker News mainly revolves around the limitations and potential dangers of relying too heavily on AI. Some users point out that the CEO's decision to implement AI in various aspects of the company's operations seems to be based on hype rather than sound decision-making. Others highlight the importance of human input and specialized skills in solving complex problems, suggesting that AI should be seen as a tool rather than a magical solution. The discussion also touches on the impact of AI on jobs and the cyclical nature of AI hype. Some users express concerns about the quality and reliability of AI-generated content, particularly in the context of search engines and SEO. Additionally, there are discussions about the usefulness of AI tools like ChatGPT and the challenges of implementing AI in practical applications. Overall, the discussion raises important questions about the responsible use of AI and the need to balance its potential benefits with careful consideration of its limitations.

### Responsibly empowering developers with AI on MDN

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/mdn/responsibly-empowering-developers-with-ai-on-mdn/) | 14 points | by [deviantintegral](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=deviantintegral) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36624590)

Mozilla has launched AI integrations with its web developer reference documentation, MDN, to provide developers with AI-driven helpers. The AI Help feature allows developers to ask questions and receive concise answers with related MDN articles for contextual help, while the AI Explain feature enables readers to explore and understand code blocks in MDN documentation. These tools aim to save developers time and provide learning resources, particularly for early-stage developers. Although there have been instances where the AI tools provide incorrect information, the MDN team is working to improve their accuracy and encourages users to provide feedback. The goal is to make MDN more accessible and useful without compromising its role as a high-quality reference source. The discussion on Hacker News includes a comment by user "klysm" who argues that responsible AI models should not be deployed without proper context, as they may produce incorrect information. Another user, "mndcrm", provides a link to a related issue and suggests that the AI Help button should include good links to existing resources.
