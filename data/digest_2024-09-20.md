#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12917) | 220 points | by [weirdcat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=weirdcat) | [87 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41600179)

In a groundbreaking study, a team of researchers has introduced a novel reinforcement learning approach, named SCoRe, aimed at enhancing the self-correction abilities of large language models (LLMs). Current models often struggle with self-correction, as prior methods either depend on multiple models or require supervision from more advanced systems. The SCoRe method overcomes these limitations by employing a multi-turn online reinforcement learning strategy that taps into data generated entirely by the model itself.

Through their research, the authors revealed that traditional supervised fine-tuning methods were insufficient for training effective self-correction, mostly due to a mismatch in data distribution. In response, they implemented regularization techniques that guide the learning process, resulting in significant performance improvements. When testing the SCoRe method on the Gemini 1.0 Pro and 1.5 Flash models, they achieved remarkable results, boosting the models' self-correction abilities by 15.6% and 9.1%, respectively, on challenging benchmarks like MATH and HumanEval.

This innovative approach not only redefines the training landscape for LLMs but also sets a new standard for self-corrective capabilities in AI, heralding a significant advancement in machine learning methodologies.

### Contextual Retrieval

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/contextual-retrieval) | 293 points | by [loganfrederick](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=loganfrederick) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41598119)

In an era where AI chatbots must excel in contextual understanding, a revolutionary enhancement called **Contextual Retrieval** has emerged. This approach tackles a common challenge in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—the often missed contextual details that can lead to inaccurate responses. Traditional RAG techniques risk losing vital context when they break down information into chunks, which can confuse chatbots in their responses.

The new Contextual Retrieval technique incorporates **Contextual Embeddings** and **Contextual BM25** to improve retrieval accuracy significantly. It helps reduce failed retrievals by up to **49%**, and with reranking, this number jumps to **67%**. This breakthrough not only enhances the relevance of the generated responses but is now easily deployable through the Claude API, simplifying setup for developers.

For smaller knowledge bases, including everything in a single prompt can be sufficient, especially with the added benefits of Claude’s prompt caching—reducing response times and costs drastically. However, as knowledge bases grow, Contextual Retrieval provides a viable solution, ensuring that information retrieval remains accurate and contextually rich.

By effectively merging techniques like TF-IDF with semantic embeddings, **Contextual Retrieval** maintains essential context and maximizes both precision and understanding—revolutionizing how chatbots and AI systems interact with users and access information.
