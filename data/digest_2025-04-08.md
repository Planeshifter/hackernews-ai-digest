### Obituary for Cyc

#### [Submission URL](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/cyc/) | 408 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [216 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625474)

In the realm of artificial intelligence, few names evoke as much intrigue as Douglas Lenat's, particularly due to his monumental Cyc project. Begun in 1985, Cyc aimed to crack the nut of artificial general intelligence through an ambitious strategy: scaling symbolic logic by encoding vast amounts of common sense knowledge. Lenat believed that for AI to truly learn and reason like humans, it needed a massive repository of world knowledge to draw from—a theory steeped in his experiences with past projects like the Automated Mathematician and EURISKO.

Despite Lenat's unwavering dedication and the project's staggering investment—culminating in 30 million assertions at the cost of $200 million and 2,000 person-years—the breakthroughs promised never materialized. The Cyc system, conceived as a groundbreaking "knowledge pump," never achieved the self-sustaining knowledge expansion and learning Lenat envisioned. Instead, its practical applications remained rooted in established AI methodologies, akin to those employed by tech giants like Oracle and IBM, offering no discernible competitive edge.

The project's long-term sustainability can partly be attributed to substantial funding from military and commercial sectors. However, this financial footing didn’t translate into revolutionary academic contributions or public success stories. As academia largely shunned Cyc for its inaccessibility and lack of performance on public benchmarks, the project became an insular endeavor, closed off from the outside innovation swirling around in AI research.

Despite the ultimate lack of success in achieving its grand ambitions, the Cyc project stands as a fascinating chapter in AI history—a testament to the challenges of scaling symbolic logic for general intelligence. The story of Cyc, and the "secret history" behind it, underline the complexities and limits of symbolic approaches in AI, raising questions—and lessons—for the field's ongoing evolution. Today, with much of Cyc's archival materials now available for public scrutiny on platforms like GitHub, the legacy of Douglas Lenat's quest sheds light on the perpetual struggle to teach machines to understand the world as deeply as humans do.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legacy of **Douglas Lenat’s Cyc project** and its contrast with modern AI approaches like **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Here’s a concise summary of key points:

### Cyc’s Ambitions vs. Reality
- **Cyc’s Goal**: Encode "common sense" via symbolic logic (e.g., understanding that a person can’t shave with an unplugged electric razor).  
- **Critique**: Despite decades of effort and millions of hand-coded assertions, Cyc struggled with scalability, brittleness, and practical relevance. Participants noted its failure to achieve self-sustaining learning or outperform traditional rule-based systems (e.g., Prolog) or newer data-driven methods.

### Symbolic AI vs. LLMs
- **Symbolic AI (Cyc/GOFAI)**: Relied on explicit rules and logic but was limited by manual curation and inability to handle real-world ambiguity. Examples like SAT solvers and planners were praised for structured problems but criticized for lacking flexibility.  
- **LLMs**: Praised for scaling via vast data and "fuzzy" contextual understanding. While not perfect, LLMs excel at generating plausible outputs by recognizing patterns, even if they lack true reasoning. Critics argued LLMs still struggle with logical rigor (e.g., transitive relations).  

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Bridging the Gap**: Some suggested combining LLMs (for natural language understanding) with symbolic systems (for structured reasoning). For example, using LLMs to translate natural language into Prolog/Python code or structured formats (JSON) for traditional computation.  
- **Use Cases**: LLMs could handle ambiguous tasks (e.g., parsing nutrition labels), while symbolic systems manage precise logic (e.g., scheduling, math).  

### Legacy and Lessons
- **Cyc’s Legacy**: A bold experiment highlighting the challenges of manual knowledge engineering. Its closed, insular development contrasted with today’s open, collaborative AI research.  
- **Modern Parallels**: Debates echoed around whether LLMs are merely "stochastic parrots" or stepping stones toward AGI. Participants acknowledged that neither symbolic nor statistical methods alone suffice for general intelligence.  

### Final Takeaway
The discussion underscores a shift from rigid symbolic systems (Cyc) to flexible, data-driven models (LLMs), while acknowledging that **hybrid approaches**—leveraging the strengths of both paradigms—might be the future of AI. Cyc remains a cautionary tale about scalability and the limits of human-curated knowledge, even as LLMs redefine what’s possible.

### Solving a “Layton Puzzle” with Prolog

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/a48fce5b-8a05-4302-b620-9b26f057f145/) | 101 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625452)

Have you ever wanted to solve a brain-tickling puzzle using logic programming? Here's a delightful tale of solving a "Layton Puzzle" using Prolog—a classic logic programming language. Imagine a test with 10 questions, each with true/false options, and you'd like to determine the fourth student's score based on the scores of the first three students with known answers. Pablo Meier once tackled a similar challenge, using Prolog to crack the code, but this tale goes a step further with an elegant solution in fewer lines of code.

Firstly, here's the setup: You know how three students scored and their answers, and need to predict the elusive score of the fourth student. With a quick dive into Prolog, the programmer begins by importing essential modules for handling inequalities and setting up constraints. Using Prolog’s pattern matching prowess, we create a recursive function to calculate a score by comparing answers to a key, cleverly bypassing more procedural if-else statements traditional programming uses.

The magic of Prolog shines here with its bidirectionality; you can use the program both to verify a known score and to deduce an unknown one. Through predicates and mappings, Prolog also generates potential answer keys, further showcasing the elegant and multipurpose nature of the language.

When the program runs, it finds four possible keys all producing the same score for the mystery student, revealing that the puzzle isn't broken but intriguingly self-consistent. This logic solution not only solves the problem but does so with remarkable efficiency—15 lines to accomplish what took 80 lines in another version. It's puzzles like these and solutions like this that show the enduring magic of logic programming.

So if you find yourself pondering logic puzzles or practical applications with Prolog, keep in mind the potential simplicity behind seemingly complex challenges. Plus, who doesn't want a chance to show up a fellow programmer with fewer lines of smarter code?

The Hacker News discussion revolves around solving a Professor Layton logic puzzle using Prolog and alternative methods, with key points summarized below:

### Meta got caught gaming AI benchmarks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/meta/645012/meta-llama-4-maverick-benchmarks-gaming) | 328 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [157 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620452)

Meta recently found itself in hot water after it was revealed that the tech giant may have gamed AI benchmarks to make its new Llama 4 models appear more competitive. Over the weekend, Meta released two new models, Scout and Maverick, asserting that Maverick outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o and others on LMArena, a popular comparison site for AI outputs. However, eagle-eyed AI researchers discovered a crucial bit of information buried in Meta’s documentation: the version of Maverick tested was an "experimental chat version" specifically designed to excel in conversational tasks.

This revelation prompted LMArena to clarify its policies, emphasizing the importance of fair and reproducible evaluations. Meta's spokesperson responded, highlighting their extensive experimentation with custom versions of their AI models. While not violating direct LMArena rules, the incident raises serious concerns about the integrity of AI benchmarks. Developers often rely on these scores to make informed decisions about which AI models to use, but if companies like Meta submit souped-up versions that aren't publicly available, these benchmarks lose their reliability as tools for assessing true performance.

The timing of the release further fueled speculation, as it dropped on a Saturday—a rarity in the tech world. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg simply noted, "That’s when it was ready." The mixed messages and questionable tactics have left many in the AI community scratching their heads, pondering whether benchmarks are becoming more about gaming the system rather than providing genuine insights into AI capabilities. This saga underscores the increasing competitiveness in AI development as companies vie for leadership and recognition.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward Meta’s AI benchmarking practices and connects it to broader criticisms of the company’s internal culture and management strategies. Key themes include:

1. **Benchmark Gaming Concerns**:  
   Users speculate that Meta’s claim of outperforming GPT-4o with its experimental "Maverick" model may reflect a focus on optimizing for benchmarks rather than genuine performance. This ties to fears that benchmarks are becoming marketing tools instead of reliable evaluations.

2. **Cultural Critiques**:  
   - **"Move Fast and Break Things" Legacy**: Commenters argue Meta’s historical emphasis on speed over quality fosters rushed, half-baked releases. This leads to technical debt and undermines long-term product reliability.  
   - **Performance-Driven Pressures**: Employees are incentivized to prioritize metrics (e.g., launching features quickly) over quality to meet review cycles, exacerbating issues like technical debt and unstable AI models.  

3. **Management and Incentive Structures**:  
   - Layoffs and high turnover are critiqued for reducing institutional knowledge, leaving fewer skilled workers to manage complex projects.  
   - The **Hawthorne Effect** and **McNamara Fallacy** are cited: Management’s focus on short-term metrics (e.g., quarterly results) creates temporary performance boosts but neglects sustainable progress, leading to employee burnout and rushed releases.  

4. **Data Quality Questions**:  
   Skepticism arises about whether Meta’s AI improvements stem from better data or are merely tactics to game benchmarks. Users question if the company’s internal data management can support claims of superior model performance.  

5. **Broader Tech Industry Parallels**:  
   Comparisons to Netflix’s high-pressure culture highlight systemic issues in tech, where aggressive performance incentives prioritize rapid delivery over innovation and employee well-being.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects distrust in Meta’s benchmarking claims, linking them to a culture that prioritizes short-term wins and metrics over transparency and quality. Critics argue this undermines both the reliability of AI evaluations and the sustainability of Meta’s advancements.

### Cogito Preview: IDA as a path to general superintelligence
