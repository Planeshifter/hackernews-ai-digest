#### [Submission URL](https://b-fg.github.io/2023/05/07/waterlily-on-gpu.html) | 219 points | by [moelf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moelf) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35861435)

WaterLily.jl, a pure Julia fluid simulator, has successfully ported its solver from a serial CPU execution to a backend-agnostic execution that includes multi-threaded CPU and GPU from different vendors (NVIDIA and AMD) thanks to KernelAbstractions.jl (KA). Using the @kernel macro from KA, the team was able to generate the divergence operator using KernelAbstractions by defining a divergence kernel and a wrapper function. To automate the generation of loops, the team defined the macro @loop, which generates loops over CartesianIndices ranges automatically. Additionally, this approach can be used to generate KA kernels for each loop in the code. The extended abstract preprint with benchmarking details regarding this port can be found on arXiv.

ions of the same logic to the reader. For example, we can use = with ⌿ in order to detect repeated groups, or we can use ≠ with ⌿ in order to detect transitions. All this is possible thanks to the idiomatic notation in APL, which combines suggestivity and compositionality in order to allow for easy manipulation and exploration of complex structures.

The submission discusses the use of APL, an array-oriented programming language, and its unique syntax, which can be challenging to understand for beginners. However, some users recommend resources such as the APL glyph dictionary and tutorials on YouTube and the APL Orchard website for learning APL. Others note that APL's syntax can be confusing but suggest that its ability to express complex operations succinctly and transparently makes it a valuable language to learn. Some users also discuss the challenges of translating APL code to other languages and the limitations of APL's syntax in certain situations. One user suggests that learning APL can be beneficial for improving problem-solving skills and encourages the use of shorter, more expressive code. There is also some discussion about inaccuracies in the initial summary of the submission and the difficulty of explaining APL algorithms to beginners.

### Restricting network access using Linux Network Namespaces

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.sigma-star.at/post/2023/05/sandbox-netns/) | 95 points | by [Deeg9rie9usi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Deeg9rie9usi) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35860827)

In their latest blog post, the Linux team explores ways to restrict network access using Linux Network Namespaces, which create a new instance of the Linux network stack. They demonstrate how to ensure an application can no longer access the network or establish new connections by creating a new network namespace that contains no network interfaces, apart from a new instance of the loopback interface. To connect the network namespace to the outside world, the application must either set up a virtual Ethernet connection or move a physical network interface into the namespace, which is typically done by container engines and is a privileged operation. This feature allows for the creation of network servers that can serve a listening socket while being disconnected from the outside world, making it impossible for attackers to create a new socket to reach destinations outside the sandbox.

The submission explains how Network Namespaces can restrict network access on Linux. By creating a new namespace with no network interfaces, an application can no longer access the network or establish new connections without a virtual Ethernet connection or by moving a physical network interface into the namespace, which is generally done by container engines. This feature can be useful for creating network servers that listen to sockets without being connected to the outside world. The comments discuss different aspects of implementing socket activation in an empty network namespace and suggest options such as Sandstorm, network ACLs, and Tailscale. The discussion also highlights the importance of supporting listening sockets and passing sockets to a proxy service. One commenter links to other resources on virtual container networking and network namespaces.

### Giving GPT “Infinite” Knowledge

#### [Submission URL](https://sudoapps.substack.com/p/giving-gpt-infinite-knowledge) | 116 points | by [sudoapps](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sudoapps) | [83 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35864698)

Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT can provide accurate responses to information retrieval questions if fed with relevant real-time data for interpretation. However, a limitation on the number of tokens for the initial prompt or response to generate results restricts LLMs from ingesting large amounts of data directly. To overcome this hurdle, data is converted into embeddings - vector representations of a string - and stored in vector databases. When a user asks a question, similarity search is done for relevant information with only the essential pieces related to the question being injected into the LLM prompt before answering the question. While there are token limitations, string compression techniques can help accommodate more data within the limit.

The discussion on this submission consists of a variety of viewpoints on the capabilities and limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in their ability to comprehend and analyze data beyond the token limitations. Some commenters suggest that embeddings-based search is a viable solution that allows for relevant data to be retrieved within the token limit, while others express concerns about the effectiveness of such an approach. There are also discussions about the potential of training larger models with real-time data to further enhance LLMs' performance and capabilities. Additionally, there are debates about the practical application of LLMs and their scalability, with some commenters expressing skepticism about their ability to achieve true artificial general intelligence (AGI) and others suggesting that advancements in technology may make it possible in the future.

I'm sorry, but this is not a news story. It appears to be a form or document management system. Is there a specific news story on Hacker News that you would like me to summarize?

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has temporarily blocked access to artificial intelligence (AI) tools provided by OpenAI and ChatGPT to agency personnel, as it assesses potential legal, privacy, and cybersecurity issues stemming from using the tools. AI technology automates human intelligence processes to carry out tasks in business information and collect and process large amounts of data that contain sensitive financial, confidential business and Personally Identifiable Information. While the agency works on implementing security measures, the interim decision to block AI tools was taken after careful consideration of multiple factors, including potential legal information security and privacy concerns, compliance requirements, and a request for an exception from the Information Security Officer. The decision will be reviewed once the final communication arrives. The discussion on Hacker News also raised concerns about the risk of sensitive data being exposed if the AI tool is compromised. Some users have pointed out that searching on Google itself presents potential legal issues and that restrictions on sharing data find favour with some stakeholders.

SkyLink is a simple web extension that is designed to detect if the current website is connected to a Bluesky user. It works by detecting Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) in a domain's TXT records and checking via the alternative HTTPS method linking to the associated Bluesky profile. When a profile is detected, the icon lights up blue, and clicking it will take you to their profile. It's reminiscent of the good 'ol days of visiting someone's blog and being delighted when the "RSS" lit up in your browser, and frees users from hunting on a page for a random bird icon to find someone's online profile.

SkyLink, a web extension designed to detect if the current website is connected to a Bluesky user was the top story on Hacker News.
