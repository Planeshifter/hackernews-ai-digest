#### [Submission URL](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2024-05-31-benchmarking-go-error-handling/) | 160 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [103 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40539700)

Today on Hacker News, a blog post delved into the surprising performance differences in error handling strategies in Go. The post originally overstated the performance gaps due to benchmark configuration issues but ultimately revealed insightful results. Strategies like using sentinel errors with direct equality checks or implementing bool returns instead of errors showed varying speeds, with some being over 70 times slower than the fastest approach. The breakdown of each strategy's performance when handling found and not found scenarios shed light on the impact of error handling on code efficiency. The Bool strategy, where errors are not returned but a boolean is used instead, emerged as the top performer in both cases, emphasizing the importance of well-designed error handling in optimizing code performance.

The discussion on the blog post about error handling strategies in Go included various insights and corrections. Some users pointed out that benchmark numbers are crucial, emphasizing the importance of accurate comparisons. There was a debate on the performance impact of different error handling approaches, such as using bool returns or sentinel errors. One user highlighted the significance of well-designed error handling systems for optimizing code efficiency and speed. Additionally, the conversation touched on topics like the trade-offs between simplicity and performance in error handling, the role of error handling in programming languages' evolution, and the impact of reflection on code speed.
