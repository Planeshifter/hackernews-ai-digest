#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/superconducting-computer) | 80 points | by [redbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=redbell) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40532771)

The June 2024 issue of IEEE Spectrum introduces an intriguing concept of putting a data center in a shoebox using superconductors. The article discusses how the increasing power consumption of computers, especially with the growth of AI, is becoming unsustainable for our planet. Superconductors, which operate without energy dissipation at cryogenic temperatures, offer a potential solution to drastically reduce energy consumption in computing.

By achieving virtually zero-resistance interconnects, minimal energy usage for digital logic, and increased computing density through 3D chip stacking, superconductors present a promising alternative to traditional computing methods. Research at Imec has shown that superconducting computers become more power-efficient than classical computers at a scale equivalent to today's high-performance systems. 

Imec has developed superconducting processing units that can be produced using standard CMOS tools, making them a hundred times more energy-efficient than current chips. This advancement could lead to a computer that can pack a data center's computing power into a system the size of a shoebox, revolutionizing the field of energy-efficient computation.

The discussion on the submission about putting a data center in a shoebox using superconductors on Hacker News covers various technical aspects and challenges related to superconducting computing. Some users highlighted the potential energy efficiency and drastic reduction in power consumption offered by superconductors, while others raised concerns about practical issues such as cooling, interconnects, and signal loss in superconducting systems. 

A user pointed out the technical features of the superconducting memory and processing units and how they differ from traditional CMOS-based systems. Another user discussed the limitations of existing superconducting systems in terms of large dimensions and high current requirements. 

Furthermore, there were discussions about the comparison between superconducting computing and quantum computing, as well as the implications of Landauer's principle in energy consumption. Some users delved into the complexities of superconducting technology, such as handling AC signals, signal integrity, and the challenges of achieving constant current flow in superconducting circuits. 

Overall, the discussions touched on various technical intricacies, performance comparisons, and practical considerations of superconducting computing, showcasing a mix of excitement for the potential advancements and skepticism regarding the implementation challenges.

### Legal models hallucinate in 1 out of 6 (or more) benchmarking queries

#### [Submission URL](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/ai-trial-legal-models-hallucinate-1-out-6-or-more-benchmarking-queries) | 209 points | by [rfw300](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rfw300) | [227 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40538019)

Artificial intelligence (AI) tools are rapidly reshaping the legal landscape, but a new study from Stanford RegLab and HAI researchers reveals a concerning issue - hallucinations. These AI tools, used for tasks like legal research and document drafting, have shown a tendency to generate false information. Even specialized legal AI tools from prominent providers like LexisNexis and Thomson Reuters exhibit a significant rate of hallucinations, with errors ranging from 17% to over 34% of the time.

The study, focusing on benchmarking AI in the legal field, highlights the risks associated with relying on AI for critical legal work. The researchers designed a challenging dataset of legal queries to test the performance of these tools, uncovering instances where the AI-generated responses were either incorrect or inaccurately cited legal sources.

The implications of these hallucinations in legal AI tools go beyond mere inaccuracies; they could potentially mislead users into making incorrect legal judgments. The study underscores the need for more robust evaluations and transparency in the development and deployment of AI tools in the legal domain to ensure their reliability and trustworthiness.

The discussion on the submission regarding AI tools in the legal domain raises several interesting points. Users like 'Drakim' compare the functioning of Google Maps with AI tools like LLMs, highlighting how AI processes information differently from humans. They discuss the nuances of truth and falsity in AI-generated content and the importance of understanding how these systems operate. 'srfngdn' points out the limitations of LLMs in discerning truth and the challenges they pose in real-world applications.

The conversation delves into the complexities of AI hallucinations, emphasizing the need for accurate and reliable AI tools in critical domains such as law. Users like 'bsch' express concerns about the potential impact of false information generated by AI and the importance of verifying sources. 'stalked_why' contributes to the discussion by questioning the intelligence of LLMs compared to human intelligence, prompting a debate on the nature of intelligence and the capabilities of AI.

Amidst debates on cognitive tasks and the reliability of AI-generated content, users like 'gwrn' and 'tmr' discuss the conditioning of AI models, the delineation of truth and falsity in AI outputs, and the challenges in predicting human behavior. The conversation delves into the intricacies of AI technology, emphasizing the importance of understanding and improving these tools for accurate and ethical use in various domains.

### Man scammed after AI told him fake Facebook customer support number was real

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/facebook-customer-support-scam-1.7219581) | 256 points | by [deviantintegral](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=deviantintegral) | [138 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40536860)

A Winnipeg man fell victim to a scam after being misled by an AI tool into believing a fake Facebook customer support number was legitimate. Dave Gaudreau ended up losing hundreds of dollars when he called the fraudulent hotline and unwittingly gave scammers access to his Facebook account. Despite receiving reassurance from the "Meta AI" search tool that the number was valid, Gaudreau soon realized he had been duped when the scammers attempted to make unauthorized purchases using his accounts. Fortunately, Gaudreau took swift action by cancelling his credit cards, locking his bank accounts, and reporting the incident to authorities. He also managed to get the fraudulent charges reversed with the help of PayPal. The ordeal serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of trusting AI blindly and the importance of verifying information independently to avoid falling prey to scams.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the misuse of phone numbers for customer support services by big companies like Facebook. Some users point out that traditional phone support systems are becoming obsolete and suggest alternative solutions like small claims court or customer-centric credit reporting services. Others criticize companies for not providing direct human support and relying on AI or automated systems instead. There is also a debate about the limitations and risks of AI tools like LLMs (large language models) in providing accurate information and the importance of understanding their capabilities. The conversation delves into the complexities of AI development, the need for better technical understanding, and the potential societal and environmental impacts of relying heavily on AI technologies.
