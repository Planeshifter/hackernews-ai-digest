#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/thomson-reuters-ai-copyright-lawsuit/) | 362 points | by [johnneville](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johnneville) | [153 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018251)

In a landmark decision, Thomson Reuters has emerged victorious in the first major AI copyright case in the US, setting a significant precedent in the world of artificial intelligence and copyright law. In 2020, Thomson Reuters took legal AI startup Ross Intelligence to court, accusing them of unlawfully reproducing materials from their legal research branch, Westlaw. Judge Stephanos Bibas of the US District Court of Delaware delivered a decisive ruling, rejecting all potential defenses from Ross Intelligence and ruling in favor of Thomson Reuters.

This verdict highlights the complexities surrounding the use of copyrighted material in AI development, a hot-topic issue as more AI companies face similar lawsuits globally. Notably, the court dismissed Ross’s argument of fair use, a doctrine AI companies often rely on to defend the use of copyrighted works without permission. Bibas emphasized that Ross's intent to compete directly with Westlaw undermined their fair use claim, particularly affecting the market value of the original Westlaw content.

Thomson Reuters celebrated the outcome, underscoring the protection of their editorial content created by attorney editors. This decision, industry experts suggest, could unfavorably tip the scales against AI companies attempting to leverage fair use as a defense, signaling potential challenges ahead for other tech giants like OpenAI and Google facing similar legal battles. The financial strain of these lawsuits is already evident, as Ross Intelligence was compelled to shut down in 2021 due to the litigation costs.

Legal scholars, including Cornell's James Grimmelmann and Womble Bond Dickinson's Chris Mammen, point out the implications for generative AI firms and the relevancy of case law they can cite in future fair use arguments. This case could influence how courts handle similar disputes, potentially curbing the latitude AI companies have in training on copyrighted materials. As the legal landscape evolves, this ruling serves as a pivotal reference point in the ongoing dialogue between AI innovation and intellectual property rights.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on the Thomson Reuters vs. Ross Intelligence Case:**

1. **Court’s Reasoning & Fair Use Rejection:**  
   Commenters highlight the court’s emphasis on Ross Intelligence’s direct competition with Westlaw. By paying workers to paraphrase Westlaw’s copyrighted **headnotes** (case summaries) and using them to train an AI model, Ross aimed to replicate Westlaw’s service at a lower cost. The court rejected the fair use defense, arguing this undercut the market value of the original work. Comparisons were drawn to translating books (e.g., English to French) and selling them as substitutes, which would harm the original creator’s sales.

2. **AI Training & Copyright Implications:**  
   - Some users debated whether **verbatim copying** vs. **paraphrasing** of headnotes matters. The court ruled that even paraphrased summaries, if derived from copyrighted material, can infringe if they serve the same market purpose.  
   - A key analogy: Using Westlaw’s headnotes to build a competing AI tool is likened to "using Windows to create Linux"—a derivative product that directly substitutes the original.  
   - Concerns arose about **large language models (LLMs)** relying on copyrighted content. If courts demand licensing for all training data, it could stifle AI innovation, especially for startups unable to afford legal battles.

3. **Educational Fair Use vs. Commercial Competition:**  
   - Users compared the case to educational exceptions (e.g., students analyzing copyrighted works in class). However, the court distinguished Ross’s **commercial intent** from non-profit educational use.  
   - Critics questioned whether AI training should receive protections similar to academic research, but the ruling suggests commercial AI ventures won’t get the same leeway.

4. **Broader Legal Debates:**  
   - **Copyrightability of Headnotes:** Some argued headnotes involve creative selection/organization of legal facts, making them copyrightable. Others likened them to uncreative “fishing expeditions” for relevant case quotes.  
   - **Precedent Risks:** The decision could encourage stricter interpretations of fair use, forcing AI companies to license content or create original datasets. This might disproportionately harm smaller firms (as seen with Ross’s 2021 shutdown due to litigation costs).

5. **Industry Reactions & Future Impact:**  
   - Legal experts noted parallels to ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI and Google. The ruling may embolden content creators to sue AI firms using their data.  
   - A divide emerged: Some praised the decision for protecting creators’ labor, while others warned it risks entrenching monopolies (e.g., Westlaw dominating legal research) and stifling competition.  

**Key Takeaway:** The case underscores the tension between AI innovation and copyright protection, with courts leaning toward safeguarding original works in commercial contexts. For AI developers, the path forward may require licensing agreements or entirely original training data—a costly barrier for many.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The B580 is seen as a promising midrange option with its VRAM advantage, but Intel faces challenges in pricing consistency and stock availability. Nvidia’s VRAM strategy draws ire, while technical barriers limit consumer GPUs from catering to AI workloads.

### LLMs can teach themselves to better predict the future

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05253) | 166 points | by [bturtel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bturtel) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014918)

In a fascinating development for the AI field, researchers Benjamin Turtel, Danny Franklin, and Philipp Schoenegger have showcased a revolutionary method for enhancing the predictive prowess of large language models (LLMs) without the need for human-curated data. Their paper, recently submitted to arXiv, introduces an outcome-driven fine-tuning framework that empowers LLMs to teach themselves better future forecasting skills.

The crux of their method involves model self-play to create diverse reasoning paths and probabilistic forecasts which are evaluated by their proximity to actual outcomes. These pairs of reasoning trajectories are then ranked and fine-tuned using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Through this systematic approach, the forecasting accuracy of models like Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B improved by 7 to 10%—an enhancement bringing them on par with the predictive capabilities of much larger models such as GPT-4o.

This research, filed under Computation and Language as well as Artificial Intelligence, signifies a noteworthy leap forward, suggesting that LLMs hold the potential to autonomously refine their futures forecasting abilities, thereby minimizing the reliance on extensive human input. For those interested, the detailed study can be accessed in full on arXiv.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the implications and validity of the AI forecasting research, ethical concerns, and broader philosophical debates. Key points include:
