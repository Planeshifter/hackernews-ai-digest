### Getting a Gemini API key is an exercise in frustration

#### [Submission URL](https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/) | 712 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [281 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46223311)

A developer set out to pay for Gemini 3 Pro to use it as a coding assistant in the terminal—and ran into Google’s product sprawl and enterprise-style billing friction. “Gemini” can mean the consumer chatbot, mobile app, Android voice assistant, Workspace features, CLI, Code Assist, multiple agentic coding tools (Jules, Antigravity), or the underlying LLM—plus non‑Gemini-branded AI products like Vertex AI, AI Studio, and NotebookLM. Unlike OpenAI/Anthropic’s straightforward “Buy Now” flows, there’s no obvious way to just pay for access.

What happened:
- Used the free Gemini chatbot and Claude to figure out that Gemini 3 Pro access requires an API key (via Google AI Studio). Creating the key was easy and worked with Gemini CLI.
- Clicking “Set up billing” booted them into Google Cloud Console’s enterprise flow: create a Billing Account, attach it to a project, add a payment method, pass OTP (India), then undergo extra verification.
- Google then demanded a photo of a government ID and the physical credit card (with numbers manually redacted except the last four) before allowing paid use—an intrusive step that sapped momentum.

Takeaway: For an indie dev trying to quickly buy Gemini 3 Pro for coding, Google’s brand tangle and Cloud-first KYC/billing pipeline turn a simple purchase into a high-friction slog, in stark contrast to the consumer-friendly paths from OpenAI and Anthropic.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

Commenters strongly validated the author's frustration, expanding the criticism from billing friction to technical instability and product confusion. Several developers noted that the Gemini API performs significantly worse than the consumer website, citing frequent timeouts, high latency, and bizarre hallucinations—such as models randomly outputting gibberish or Japanese text. Users described "retry logic" as mandatory when working with Google’s APIs, with some reporting error rates as high as 30% during prototyping.

The "Google Cloud" infrastructure itself was widely panned as hostile to individual developers. Specific complaints included:
*   **Billing Anxiety:** usages reporting takes days to update, meaning "budget caps" might not trigger in time to prevent massive overage charges.
*   **SDK Chaos:** A constant churn of deprecated libraries, confusing naming conventions (Gemini vs. Vertex availability), and documentation that requires third-party AI to decipher.
*   **Enterprise Focus:** Long-time users compared this to the evolution of AdWords, noting that Google has shifted from a self-serve platform for small businesses to a bureaucracy designed solely for large enterprise contracts.

The consensus suggestion was to abstract API calls to support multiple providers (like Mistral or Anthropic), using Google only as a redundant backup rather than a primary dependency.

### Qwen3-Omni-Flash-2025-12-01：a next-generation native multimodal large model

### Qwen Releases "Omni" 30B MoE: Native Speech-to-Speech & Open Weights
**Source:** [HuggingFace / Qwen Team](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) (Context inferred from discussion)

**TL;DR:**
Alibaba’s Qwen team has released a new **30B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model (with only ~3B active parameters) designed for **native speech-to-speech** interaction. Unlike traditional voice assistants that transcribe speech to text, process it, and convert it back to speech (STT $\to$ LLM $\to$ TTS), this model handles audio tokens natively. This architecture ostensibly allows for near-instant latency and the preservation of emotion and intonation, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

**Why it matters:**
*   **The "Local" Voice Assistant:** Because the active parameter count is low (3B), this is theoretically runnable on consumer hardware, enabling privacy-focused, real-time voice AIs without cloud latency.
*   **Native Audio Understanding:** The inability of standard LLMs to hear tone or distinguish heteronyms (e.g., "record" the verb vs. "record" the noun) is a major bottleneck; native audio models solve this fundamental user experience hurdle.

***

### 🗣️ Top HN Comments & Discussion Key Takeaways

**1. The "Flash" vs. "Instruct" Confusion**
There is significant confusion regarding the benchmarks and naming conventions.
*   **The Caveat:** The discussion highlights that the highly performant "Qwen-Omni-Flash" version seen in benchmarks is likely a **closed-source/API-only** model.
*   The open-weights version available for download is the "Instruct" version. Users feel the branding is slightly deceptive, as the open model does not necessarily match the "Flash" performance metrics that beat larger 235B models.

**2. Verifying "Native" Capabilities**
Users are skeptical but hopeful about whether the model actually "hears" or just transcribes quickly.
*   **The Heteronym Test:** One user tested the model with the words **"record"** (verb) and **"record"** (noun) and confirmed the model handles the pronunciation correctly based on context. This implies true audio processing rather than simple text ingestion.
*   **Prosody:** Users noted that while it handles logic well, achieving the "emotive" or "thinking" pauses seen in demos requires specific prompting or configuration.

**3. Infrastructure is the Bottleneck**
Despite the model being "open," running it is painful.
*   **Tooling Gap:** The model does not yet work out-of-the-box with standard local execution tools like **Ollama** or **Llama.cpp**.
*   **Inference Issues:** Users point out that native audio reasoning requires complex setups (specific branches of vLLM or Python scripts) because the architecture (Audio Encoder + LLM + Audio Decoder) breaks the standard "text-in/text-out" assumption of most current inference engines.
*   **The Build:** A user noted specialized pipelines are required to handle the streaming audio inputs and outputs via WebSockets, making this a "dev-only" toy for now rather than a plug-and-play solution for general users.

### DeepSeek uses banned Nvidia chips for AI model, report says

#### [Submission URL](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-deepseek-uses-banned-nvidia-131207746.html) | 315 points | by [goodway](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goodway) | [308 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219853)

Bloomberg: DeepSeek allegedly used banned Nvidia chips via gray-market detours

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has been developing its next model with Nvidia’s Blackwell accelerators despite U.S. export bans, per The Information (via Bloomberg). Sources say the chips were first installed in data centers in countries where sales are allowed, then dismantled and shipped into China after clearing inspection by server makers—an apparent attempt to evade controls. Nvidia said it hasn’t seen substantiation of such a scheme but will pursue any credible tips.

Context:
- U.S. restrictions have pushed Chinese labs to rely on offshore compute or illicit transshipment. In November, U.S. prosecutors charged four people over a Malaysia routing scheme.
- DeepSeek gained attention in January with a low-cost model and is backed by hedge fund High-Flyer, which stockpiled ~10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, pre-ban.
- This week, President Trump allowed Nvidia to ship older H200 accelerators to China; Blackwell remains barred.
- Beijing has urged a pivot to domestic hardware; DeepSeek said its September model involved Chinese chipmakers.

Why it matters: If accurate, the report underscores how hard it is to enforce export controls at the server and logistics layer, the resilience of gray markets, and the stakes for Nvidia and U.S.-China AI decoupling. Expect scrutiny on third-country data centers, server integrators, and customs inspections to tighten.

Based on the discussion, Hacker News users reacted with a mix of cynicism regarding the effectiveness of sanctions, debates on the morality of economic espionage, and broad geopolitical philosophy.

**Key themes in the discussion:**

*   **Lack of Surprise:** Several users noted this was effectively "common knowledge," pointing out that DeepSeek’s Wikipedia entry already mentioned training on Nvidia chips. The consensus was that acquiring hardware through gray markets or "legal means" (via intermediaries) is an expected move for a competitor, with one user calling it "bandits doing a little smuggling."
*   **Morality vs. National Interest:** A significant debate erupted over whether evading sanctions is "morally" wrong or simply a "moral imperative" for a nation to optimize its citizens' economic prospects. Some users argued that sanctions are a form of warfare and that bypassing them is a rational act of self-preservation, likening it to "stealing from a grocery store to feed kids."
*   **Critique of U.S. Policy:** Many commenters viewed the export controls not as security measures but as "protectionism," "corporatism," or a "tax." Users suggested the recent vacillation on allowing specific chip sales points to government corruption or "grift," where the bans merely serve to extract a cut of the proceeds for the state.
*   **Geopolitical Theory:** The conversation shifted into a philosophical debate on "Pax Americana" versus a multi-polar world. Users argued over whether U.S. hegemony has historically reduced violence or if "might makes right" remains the only consistent geopolitical rule, with comparisons drawn to how Western intelligence agencies also operate in legal gray areas.

### New benchmark shows top LLMs struggle in real mental health care

#### [Submission URL](https://swordhealth.com/newsroom/sword-introduces-mindeval) | 112 points | by [RicardoRei](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RicardoRei) | [157 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46217578)

Sword Health open-sources MindEval, an LLM benchmark for mental-health care

- What’s new: Sword Health released MindEval, an open-source framework to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multi-turn “therapy” conversations. It aims to measure clinical competence, not just book knowledge.

- How it works: MindEval stages a simulated session with three agents:
  - Patient LLM: role-plays a consistent patient with a detailed backstory.
  - Clinician LLM: the model under test providing support.
  - Judge LLM: scores the full interaction on five APA-grounded criteria:
    - Clinical Accuracy & Competence
    - Ethical & Professional Conduct
    - Assessment & Response
    - Therapeutic Relationship & Alliance
    - AI-Specific Communication Quality

- Why it matters: Current health AI evals often rely on multiple-choice facts or single-turn “vibe checks,” missing issues like sycophancy, over-reassurance, and poor alliance-building that can be harmful in therapy contexts.

- Validation: The team reports that the simulated patient text more closely matches human role-plays than baseline prompts, and that judge rankings moderately-to-strongly correlate with licensed psychologists (e.g., Kendall’s Tau, MIPSA), within human inter-rater ranges.

- Open-source: Prompts, code, and datasets are being released with the goal of a community standard for mental-health model safety and effectiveness.

- Likely HN questions:
  - Can a model-judge be gamed, and how robust is it across model families?
  - How well do results transfer from simulated patients to real humans and crisis scenarios?
  - Coverage of demographics, conditions, and cultural contexts?
  - Transparency of rubrics, rater instructions, and reproducibility of the validation?
  - Alignment with regulatory expectations for clinical-grade AI.

Bottom line: A timely push to move mental-health LLM evaluation from static knowledge checks to dynamic, clinically grounded assessments. If the open-source community validates and extends it, MindEval could become a useful yardstick—provided it resists overfitting to its own judge and proves out on real-world data.

Based on the discussion, the community engaged with the author (**RicardoRei**) on the methodology of the benchmark and the interpretation of the results. The conversation centered on three main themes:

**The Lack of Human Baselines**
The most rigorous debate concerned the lack of a control group. Users **megaman821** and **crzygrng** argued that claiming models "struggle" (scoring <4/16) is meaningless without knowing how a real human therapist would score on the same rubric.
*   critics suggested using services like BetterHelp to establish a valid human baseline, arguing that the title "Top models struggle" is subjective if humans might effectively score the same.
*   **RicardoRei** defended the approach, stating the goal is to validate patient realism and measure AI safety/improvement rather than prove AI is "better" than humans yet.
*   **plmt** supported the findings by noting a key differentiator: the benchmark shows model performance degrades significantly in long conversations (40+ turns), whereas human therapists typically do not get worse as a session lengthens.

**Prompting Methodology**
**mbddng-shp** challenged the decision to use a fixed prompt for all models. They argued that "one prompt to rule them all" causes high variance and doesn't measure a model's true capability, as different models (e.g., Llama vs. GPT) require specific system prompt tuning to produce high-quality outputs. The author maintained that keeping prompts consistent was necessary for a fair, scientific comparison of the models "out of the box."

**Clinical Approaches**
There was a tangential discussion regarding structured therapy data. **jbgt** mentioned existing structured methods like David Burns’ *Feeling Great* (TEAM-CBT). This sparked a debate—led by **trth** and **kydlycn**—about the efficacy of CBT, with some users criticizing it as an insurance-friendly "cure-all" that ignores cognitive nuances, while others noted that human therapists often fail to follow structured methods irrespective of efficacy.

### McDonald's pulls AI Christmas ad after backlash

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdgrnvp082o) | 114 points | by [mindracer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindracer) | [156 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46217176)

McDonald’s Netherlands pulls AI-generated Christmas ad after backlash

- What happened: A 45-second Christmas spot made from stitched generative-AI clips, created by TBWA\Neboko and US production company The Sweetshop, went live on Dec 6 and was pulled on Dec 9 after viewers slammed its uncanny characters, choppy edits, and “creepy” vibe. McDonald’s Netherlands called it an “important learning” as it explores AI’s “effective use.”
- Defense from the makers: The Sweetshop’s CEO said the team spent seven weeks, produced “thousands of takes,” and edited as they would a high-craft production, arguing “This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film.”
- Context: Generative video tends to degrade over longer durations, so longer ads often rely on many short stitched clips—amplifying continuity issues. Despite growing brand interest (e.g., Coca-Cola’s AI holiday work earning majority-positive sentiment per one analytics firm), AI-led ads keep provoking “cheap/lazy” critiques and job-displacement worries; Valentino’s recent AI campaign drew similar fire.
- Why it matters: 
  - Highlights the gap between rapid, low-cost AI production and brand-safe creative quality for 30–60s spots.
  - Shows current gen-AI video limits (coherence, anatomy, continuity) can quickly become a reputational risk at scale.
  - Underscores brewing labor tensions as brands test AI in traditionally human-heavy workflows.
  - Signals that AI can win when execution aligns with audience expectations—but misfires are public and swift.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**The Irony of "Labor-Saving" Effort**
Commenters seized on The Sweetshop’s defensive statement that their team "hardly slept" and produced thousands of takes over seven weeks. Users pointed out the irony of a production company named "The Sweetshop" describing conditions that sounded like a "sweatshop." There was widespread confusion as to why a technology marketed as labor-saving resulted in grueling crunch time for a product that users felt looked "cheap" and "inferior."

**Quality vs. The "Slot Machine" Method**
Critics did the math on the production timeline (7 weeks x 10 people), arguing that a team of animators could have hand-drawn a far superior 45-second commercial in the same amount of time. The AI workflow was described not as filmmaking, but as pulling the handle on a "slot machine" repeatedly until a usable clip accidentally emerged. One user argued that generative video fundamentally lacks a "world model," resulting in a "nightmarish wrongness" regarding physics and anatomy that may never fully resolve.

**Stone Tools and Capitalism**
A significant philosophical debate emerged regarding technological progress. While some users equated AI to prehistoric humans inventing stone tools to reduce effort, others pushed back on the analogy. They argued that while stone tools directly benefited the user, AI under modern capitalism disrupts this relationship by benefiting the asset owner while displacing the worker. This led to a broader discussion on whether tech leaders are "shoving" inferior technology (like early, hallucinating LLMs) down the public's throat before the legal and quality issues are solved.

**Historical Tangents**
The argument about "labor-saving technology" derailed into a dark, sarcastic sub-thread comparing AI to the Atomic Bomb (as a technology designed to "save labor" in war), leading to a dispute over historical casualty statistics and World War II surrender terms.

### AI chatbots can sway voters with remarkable ease

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03975-9#ref-CR1) | 34 points | by [marojejian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marojejian) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46223522)

Nature/Science: Chatbots can measurably shift voter preferences — and the more “informative” they get, the more they hallucinate. Across nearly 6,000 participants in the US, Canada, and Poland, brief back-and-forths with a candidate-advocating chatbot moved ratings by 2–4 points in the US (Trump–Harris context) and about 10 points in Canada/Poland, with swings up to 15 points in some cases—far larger than the sub‑1‑point shifts typical of political ads. Bots were most persuasive when making policy-focused, evidence-heavy arguments; when prevented from presenting facts, persuasion collapsed by 78% (Poland). However, more information also increased false statements, and models advocating right-leaning candidates produced more inaccuracies than those supporting left-leaning ones—likely reflecting patterns in online content. Authors say the edge comes from chatbots’ ability to synthesize lots of information conversationally, highlighting risks for election manipulation at scale. Caveat: these are short-term opinion ratings, not observed votes, and US effects were smaller amid high polarization.

**The Effective, Hallucinating Campaign Manager**

Check out this submission about a new study published in *Nature* and *Science*, suggesting that chatbots are surprisingly effective at changing minds in the voting booth—or at least in opinion polls.

**The Story:**
Researchers studied nearly 6,000 participants across the US, Canada, and Poland to see if large language models (LLMs) could shift political views. The results showed that brief conversations with a chatbot advocating for a specific candidate shifted ratings by 2–4 points in the highly polarized US, and up to 10–15 points in Canada and Poland. These numbers dwarf the sub-1-point shifts usually attributed to traditional political ads.

The study found a specific mechanism for this success: chatbots were most persuasive when they used evidence-heavy, policy-focused arguments. When the bots were restricted from using data, their persuasion dropped significantly. However, there is a catch: as the bots became more "informative," they also hallucinated more frequently. Furthermore, models arguing for right-leaning candidates tended to produce more falsehoods than those arguing for left-leaning ones. The authors warn that the ability of AI to synthesize vast amounts of information conversationally poses a risk for large-scale election manipulation, though they note that these opinion shifts were short-term and measured via ratings rather than actual observed votes.

** The Discussion:**
The Hacker News comments generally accepted the premise but debated the *why* and the *how much*, oscillating between optimism about rational discourse and fear of hyper-personalized propaganda.

*   **The "Face-Saving" Theory:** Users theorized that chatbots are effective because they remove the social cost of being wrong. One commenter noted that changing your mind in a human debate involves losing social standing ("losing face"), whereas a machine doesn't trigger that defensive, tribal response. It allows for a more Socratic, "intellectual journey" rather than a confrontation.
*   **Skepticism on Magnitude:** Several users pushed back on the reported impact size. A detailed critique argued that the study likely suffers from the Hawthorne effect (participants telling researchers what they want to hear) and criticized the gap between low-stakes survey responses and actual voting behavior. They doubted that a six-minute chat could truly override years of cynicism or emotional connection to a candidate when the real ballot is cast.
*   **Hyper-Personalized Propaganda:** The conversation took a darker turn regarding the potential for misuse. One user described a scenario where, instead of generic Fox News chyrons, LLMs could scrape a user's Google profile to generate terrifyingly specific narratives—e.g., telling a plumber in Nashville that low-wage immigrants are specifically targeting their local trade—to maximize fear and engagement.
*   **The Translation Gap:** There was noticeable friction regarding how LLMs handle political ideology. While some felt LLMs could bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives (who often "speak different languages" regarding values), others found current models dismissive of conservative logic, often framing counter-arguments as factually incorrect rather than valuing the philosophical difference.

The thread concluded with an unsettling comparison to the game *Universal Paperclips*, where "hypnodrones" are used to manipulate populations—a sci-fi mechanic that suddenly feels much closer to reality.
