### Compiling a Lisp: Lambda lifting

#### [Submission URL](https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-12/) | 145 points | by [azhenley](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=azhenley) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44858892)

In a deep dive into compiling Lisp, a blogger embarks on an exploration of closure conversion, revisiting the Ghuloum tutorial with a fresh perspective. Originally mistitled as "lambda lifting," the revamped project shines a spotlight on closure conversion, a fundamental concept in functional programming, particularly in relation to Lisp compilers.

The author delved into the intricate task of translating the tutorial's concepts into Python, trimming the verbosity of the original C version from 1200 to a concise 300 lines of code. Despite the absence of an S-expression reader and a simplification to text assembly, the essence of the exercise stands robust, forming a stimulating challenge for readers.

A critical segment of the closure conversion process involves managing three essential lists: one for bound variables, one for free variables within a lambda, and a running tally of new code objects encountered during recursion. These lists help transform lambda and let expressions, which fundamentally involve identifying variable names to modify environments appropriately.

The author introduces a handy `LambdaConverter` class, employing Python’s powerful pattern matching to dissect expressions ranging from simple integers and characters to complex if-statements and lambdas. This systematic approach illustrates how variables are identified, whether they're bound or free, and maps how expressions like `["lambda", params, body]` are intricately transformed during closure conversion.

Engaging and informative, the post guides readers through the nuanced yet crucial process of closure conversion in compilers, offering an approachable Python implementation and testing suite for enthusiasts keen on exploring the intricacies of Lisp compilation. The piece is not only educational but serves as a creative invitation to the community to contribute or explore further, with each variable and expression serving as a puzzle piece in the grander scheme of compiling a Lisp.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around two main themes: technical aspects of Lisp compilation and broader reflections on Lisp's role in modern programming versus Python. Here's a concise summary:

1. **Compiler Techniques & Resources**:  
   - Users reference Ghuloum's compiler construction approach and books by Jeremy Siek (*Essentials of Compilation* using Racket/Python) and Nora Sandler (*Writing a C Compiler*).  
   - Past discussions on Hacker News highlight repeated interest in Ghuloum's incremental compiler tutorial over the years.  
   - Technical debates focus on **closure conversion** vs. **lambda lifting**, with concerns about efficiency (e.g., increased heap usage, code size). Examples from TXR Lisp illustrate VM-level handling of lifted lambdas and constants.  

2. **Lisp vs. Python in AI**:  
   - A historical reflection questions why Lisp, once central to AI, has been eclipsed by Python. Users note Python's dominance due to its libraries, ease of integration with low-level code (C++/CUDA), and suitability as a "glue language" for modern AI frameworks.  
   - Lisp’s decline is attributed to its niche status and Python’s broader adoption for numerical and generative AI tasks, despite Lisp’s strengths in symbolic computation.  

3. **Technical Nuances**:  
   - Closure implementation strategies in languages like C++/Java are compared, emphasizing how captured parameters affect runtime performance.  
   - Comments highlight trade-offs in optimizing closures, such as balancing code readability with runtime efficiency and memory management.  

In summary, the thread blends deep technical exchanges about Lisp compilation with broader commentary on language trends, reflecting both nostalgia for Lisp's past and pragmatism about Python's current dominance in AI development.

#### [Submission URL](https://jinjieni.notion.site/Diffusion-Language-Models-are-Super-Data-Learners-239d8f03a866800ab196e49928c019ac) | 209 points | by [babelfish](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=babelfish) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44856101)

It looks like the submission details are missing. Could you provide more context or information on the article you'd like summarized? This would help me create a concise and engaging summary for you!

**Summary of Discussion:**

A Hacker News thread debated the capabilities, efficiency, and evaluation of **autoregressive (AR) models** (like GPT) versus **diffusion models** (e.g., DALL-E), with key points and disagreements highlighted below:

### **Key Debates:**
1. **Model Capacity & Training Dynamics:**
   - AR models were noted for **requiring fewer training tokens** but faced skepticism about whether per-token improvements (e.g., training a 1B-parameter model on 10B tokens) reflect meaningful progress. 
   - Diffusion models were criticized as **computationally heavier**, though some argued their "bidirectional" attention mechanisms might capture richer relationships in higher-dimensional spaces. Analogies to 3D/4D manifolds and topological structures hinted at abstract architectural advantages.

2. **Efficiency & FLOPs:**
   - AR models benefit from **Key-Value (KV) caching**, reducing FLOPs during inference, unlike diffusion models. However, diffusion supporters argued AR’s unidirectional nature limits flexibility, while diffusion’s "full-context" processing could yield superior outputs for complex tasks.

3. **Evaluation Metrics & Skepticism:**
   - Critics (**gdlsk** and others) questioned whether standard metrics (e.g., validation loss) reliably compare architectures, calling them "proxy measures" influenced by training data distributions. A 96B-token experiment showed minor improvements, prompting debates about whether differences were statistically significant or artifacts of training dynamics.

4. **Theoretical Underpinnings:**
   - Users likened diffusion to **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning**, proposing it as a framework for iterative refinement. Others (**fncyfrdbt**) warned against dismissing models prematurely, citing past AI missteps (e.g., Minsky/Papert’s skepticism of neural networks). Discussions urged deeper mathematical analysis of architectures, particularly how transformers project data into latent spaces and whether diffusion enables better "manifold learning."

### **Notable Arguments:**
- **"Super Data Learners" Hypothesis**: AR models might simply excel at memorizing training distributions rather than learning generalizable patterns, raising concerns about out-of-distribution (OOD) performance.
- **Call for Rigor**: Participants emphasized formal definitions of metrics (e.g., "human-language correctness") and better theoretical frameworks to disentangle architecture capabilities from training data biases.

### **Conclusion:**
The thread reflects a broader uncertainty in ML research: while AR models dominate efficiency benchmarks, diffusion architectures remain intriguing for their representational potential. However, conclusive comparisons require clearer benchmarks, theoretical grounding, and scrutiny of whether current metrics capture true model "intelligence" or simply reflect computational shortcuts.

Microsoft has recently unveiled POML, or Prompt Orchestration Markup Language, marking an innovative leap in advanced prompt engineering for Large Language Models (LLMs). Inspired by web standards, POML aims to tackle the typical hurdles in crafting prompts, such as poor structure and complex data integration. It demystifies this process by employing a user-friendly, HTML-like syntax with elements like `<role>`, `<task>`, and `<example>`, transforming prompt development into a more organized, modular, and maintainable task.

POML stands out with its ability to integrate various data types—whether text, spreadsheets, or images—through dedicated components like `<document>`, `<table>`, and `<img>`. This versatility allows seamless embedding or referencing of external data sources, while a CSS-like styling system separates content from presentation, enabling easy styling changes without altering the prompt logic.

Adding another layer of sophistication, POML comes with an integrated templating engine that supports variables, loops, and conditionals, simplifying the creation of complex, data-driven prompts. Developers can experiment with these capabilities using Visual Studio Code via a dedicated extension that offers features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, and real-time previews. Additionally, SDKs for Node.js and Python ensure that POML fits smoothly into current application workflows and popular LLM frameworks.

To get started, developers can install the Visual Studio Code extension from the Marketplace or employ Node.js and Python package managers. For more information on POML's syntax, components, and development tools, Microsoft encourages users to check their comprehensive documentation and keep an eye out for their forthcoming research paper for deeper insights into POML's architecture. Microsoft invites developers to contribute and shape this evolving project, emphasizing its commitment to community-driven development.

### **Key Points of Debate**
1. **XML vs. Simplicity**:  
   - Critics argue that XML-based syntax introduces unnecessary complexity, demanding significant learning effort. Comparisons to existing frameworks like React’s JSX or YAML-based DSLs (e.g., BAML, GitHub’s `prmpt.yml`) suggest simpler, established alternatives might suffice. Some question why Microsoft didn’t build atop existing templating systems like Jinja or Markdown.

2. **Reinventing the Wheel**:  
   - Users note parallels to prior solutions like SignalWire’s "Prompt Object Model (POM)" or Apache’s XML configurations, raising concerns about redundancy. Comments like “Avoid NIH syndrome” urge leveraging existing tools rather than creating new, proprietary markup languages.

3. **Developer Experience**:  
   - While the VSCode extension’s syntax highlighting and previews are praised, others highlight frustration with fragmented workflows, SDK limitations (especially lack of C# support), and the challenge of keeping pace with rapidly evolving AI tools (e.g., agentic workflows).

4. **LLM Prompt Engineering**:  
   - Structured markup (XML/Markdown) is acknowledged as beneficial for guiding LLMs, but some argue LLMs inherently prefer flexible formats. The MVC-inspired architecture drew interest, but skeptics question if deterministic templating truly aligns with LLMs’ stochastic nature.

5. **Corporate Backing vs. Longevity**:  
   - Concerns arise about Microsoft’s track record with open-source projects and whether POML will gain community traction beyond being a research experiment. Users contrast Microsoft’s commercial goals with community-driven development needs.

### **Notable Suggestions**
- **Leverage Existing Standards**: Integrate with popular frameworks (JSX-like syntax) or use YAML/JSON for templating instead of XML.
- **Focus on SDK Breadth**: Expand SDK support beyond Python/Node.js to include .NET and other ecosystems.
- **Documentation & Use Cases**: Clarify POML’s unique value over alternatives and demonstrate practical applications in multi-prompt agent workflows.

### **Positive Notes**
- Some applaud the modularity, styling separation, and templating engine as practical improvements for complex prompts.
- The integration of external data (spreadsheets, images) and MVC-like architecture are seen as forward-thinking for enterprise use cases.

### **Conclusion**
While POML’s structured approach addresses real pain points in prompt engineering, skepticism persists about its necessity, usability, and Microsoft’s long-term commitment. The discussion underscores a broader tension between standardization and flexibility in LLM tooling.

### LLMs Aren't World Models

#### [Submission URL](https://yosefk.com/blog/llms-arent-world-models.html) | 60 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44854518)

In a thought-provoking blog post dated August 10, 2025, the author challenges the notion that language models (LLMs) are comprehensive world models. Through engaging anecdotes and examples, they argue that while LLMs have their uses, they fundamentally lack a deep understanding of certain concepts. 

The author recounts a chess match against an LLM, where, despite its vast exposure to chess games, the model failed to maintain board accuracy, ultimately leading to blunders. This illustration underscores the point that LLMs may predict language patterns but don’t inherently grasp the underlying rules governing physical or virtual realms like chess.

Shifting to digital examples, the author critiques the LLM's explanation of image blending in software like Krita. The LLM's failure to accurately describe how layered colors interact betrays a superficial grasp of image processing. This, the author argues, reflects a broader issue where LLMs lack genuine comprehension, responding instead based on linguistic patterns rather than true understanding.

The post invites a broader reflection on the limitations of LLMs. It suggests that these models, despite heavy investments, often miss key insights—like the mathematical foundation of transparency blending—indicating that they don’t truly internalize the concepts but generate plausible-sounding answers.

Ultimately, the author emphasizes that while LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities in language prediction, equating those with a model of the world might be overshooting their legitimate prowess.  The discourse invites readers to consider the dichotomy between word patterns and world understanding—a point as intriguing as it is vital in the evolving discussion around artificial intelligence.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding the blog post on LLMs' limitations as "world models" reflects nuanced debates about the nature of AI understanding, training methods, and benchmark efficacy. Key points include:

### Core Arguments  
1. **Skepticism of World Modeling**: Critics argue LLMs lack true comprehension of concepts like chess rules or color blending, relying instead on token prediction. Examples include flawed chess strategies and incorrect transparency explanations, suggesting superficial pattern-matching rather than internalized principles.  
2. **Counterarguments**: Others contend LLMs *do* encode meaningful relationships (e.g., geography, math problem-solving) through token correlations, even if indirect. Success in tasks like math Olympiads implies learned techniques, though critics dismiss this as memorization, not foundational understanding.  

### Training and Limitations  
- **Token Constraints**: Users note LLMs often generate errors (e.g., mislocating chess pieces) due to tokenization limits, lacking a persistent internal "board state."  
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**: Debates arise over whether RL fine-tuning patches knowledge gaps or merely optimizes benchmarks superficially.  

### Philosophical and Practical Concerns  
- **Definitional Disputes**: Participants clash over what constitutes a "world model"—some argue task-specific competence suffices (e.g., legal chess moves), while others demand deeper causal reasoning.  
- **Benchmarks vs. Understanding**: Skeptics highlight failures in novel reasoning (e.g., solving riddles involving perspective), whereas proponents cite success in narrow domains as progress.  

### Future Directions  
- Mixed optimism exists about scaling, with some advocating specialized training (e.g., explicit physics modeling) to address gaps. Others stress fundamental limits in LLMs’ architecture, suggesting AGI requires radically different approaches.  

### Conclusion  
The thread underscores a tension between LLM achievements and their reliance on statistical patterns, raising questions about whether true "understanding" is even necessary for practical utility. Critics urge humility in overstating capabilities, while proponents emphasize incremental advances.
