#### [Submission URL](https://www.landh.tech/blog/20250327-we-hacked-gemini-source-code/) | 583 points | by [topsycatt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=topsycatt) | [120 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43508418)

In a daring tale that sounds like it was ripped from the pages of a techno-thriller, a team of digital sleuths, helmed by Roni "Lupin" Carta, has managed to breach Google’s advanced AI, Gemini, and leak part of its source code. Known for their exploits detailed in a prior blog post titled "We Hacked Google A.I. for $50,000," Carta and his team have once again made waves by showcasing vulnerabilities in Google's latest AI security measures.

During Google's 2024 LLM bugSWAT event in Las Vegas, not just a playground for high-stakes poker but for high-stakes coding too, the team stumbled upon a novel vulnerability within Gemini. This annual event invites hackers from across the globe to test Google's AI for weaknesses, proving their commitment to staying ahead in AI security. The event culminated with Carta and his teammate, Justin "Rhynorater" Gardner, earning the prestigious Most Valuable Hacker (MVH) title.

The exploit involved Gemini's "Python Playground," a supposedly secure environment where AI-generated or user-written Python scripts could be run without causing harm to the host system. This secure space utilizes gVisor, Google's robust user-space kernel designed to prevent container escapes and reduce system vulnerability.

Yet, even the most secure systems have chinks in their armor. Carta's team cleverly avoided attempting a daunting sandbox escape, which could earn a $100k bounty, and instead focused on exploiting what lay within the confines of the sandbox. Their ingenious approach involved gaining shell access within the sandbox to access data that shouldn't have been reachable—a tactic inspired by a member of Google's own security team.

This revelation not only underscores the relentless pace of the AI arms race—with tech titans like Google, Meta, Microsoft, and new entrants like Anthropic and Mistral—fighting for supremacy but also highlights the critical need for robust security in deploying AI technologies.

The story of hacking Google’s AI Gemini is not just about the technical prowess of the Lupin & Holmes team but serves as a crucial reminder: as AI grows more ubiquitous, so too must the vigilance against security risks.

In a pioneering study by Anthropic, titled "Transformer Circuits Thread: On the Biology of a Large Language Model," researchers bring a biological investigative approach to understanding the inner workings of language models, focusing on Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model, released in October 2024, is Anthropic's current lightweight production solution. Much like biologists dissecting the complexity of living organisms, the team aims to demystify the mechanisms transforming simple training algorithms into sophisticated language abilities.

Drawing a novel parallel to microscopes revolutionizing biology, the researchers use cutting-edge tools to probe language models' insides, identifying fundamental computational units they call "features" analogous to biological cells. However, understanding these building blocks alone isn’t enough; understanding their interactions, akin to mapping a brain’s wiring, is crucial.

The key tool in their investigation is attribution graphs, which trace how a model transforms specific inputs into outputs. These graphs allow researchers to form hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, refined through detailed experiments.

Their paper delves into several intriguing findings:

1. **Multi-step Reasoning**: The model can internally perform complex reasoning, like deducing that "the capital of the state containing Dallas" is "Austin."

2. **Planning in Poems**: Remarkably, Claude 3.5 plans its poetic structures by pre-selecting rhyming words, influencing line construction from the start.

3. **Multilingual Circuits**: The model balances language-specific and abstract circuits, with more prominence in the former compared to smaller models.

4. **Addition and Medical Diagnoses**: Circuits adept at basic arithmetic generalize that process, and the model can simulate clinical reasoning by hypothesizing diagnoses based on symptoms.

5. **Entity Recognition and Hallucinations**: The model’s ability to discern known entities affects its information reliability, with misfires causing hallucinations.

6. **Harmful Request Refusal**: It generalizes a "harmful requests" feature from specific examples learned during fine-tuning.

7. **Jailbreak Analysis and Chain-of-thought Faithfulness**: The team explores how syntax manipulation tricks the model into providing dangerous instructions, and they critically analyze whether the model truly performs stated reasoning steps.

This research not only advances understanding of language models but also shapes future AI safety and utility in real-world applications. As the team pushes the frontier in transparency, their work echoes long-standing scientific traditions of questioning and illumination.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects enthusiasm for transparency in AI mechanics, skepticism about anthropomorphic language, and curiosity about real-world safety and reproducibility. Debates underscore the tension between mechanistic explanations and human-centric metaphors in AI research.

### Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred Image

#### [Submission URL](https://jerredchen.github.io/image-as-imu/) | 68 points | by [smusamashah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=smusamashah) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43502037)

In an intriguing development from the University of Oxford, researchers Jerred Chen and Ronald Clark have introduced a groundbreaking approach turning a common photographic flaw—motion blur—into a potent tool for estimating camera velocity. Dubbed "Image as an IMU," their method cleverly harnesses motion blur not as a defect to be corrected, but as a rich source of information for deducing camera movement. 

This innovative framework operates by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image, allowing it to recover the camera's instantaneous velocity through a linear least squares solution. It sidesteps the arduous task of deblurring, presenting an IMU-like measurement system that not only addresses but thrives during fast and aggressive camera motions, a common challenge in robotics and VR/AR applications.

The researchers trained their model using a vast dataset featuring realistic synthetic motion blur, enhancing accuracy with real-world data through a fully differentiable pipeline. In impressive evaluations, the model outperformed existing methods, such as MASt3R and COLMAP, particularly in angular and translational velocity estimates.

Despite the model's reliance on a solitary, motion-blurred frame, it impressively determines velocity without multi-frame requirements, achieving real-time performance at 30 Hz, even with disambiguation steps included. Utilizing just an iPhone 13 Pro for data collection, this method stands out for its speed and efficiency, offering fresh insights into overcoming the dynamic challenges posed by camera motion blur. 

The code and supplementary data supporting this paper will soon be made available for further exploration, promising a new frontier in camera motion estimation.

The Hacker News discussion on the Oxford research highlights several key themes and reactions:  

1. **Technical Comparisons**:  
   - Users compared the novel motion-blur-based approach to traditional techniques like **blind deconvolution** and **Point Spread Function (PSF)**, which are used to reverse-engineer motion blur. Some pointed to existing deblurring resources (e.g., GitHub repositories) and noted the challenges of distinguishing focus, motion blur, and camera shake in 2D images.  

2. **Depth Estimation Questions**:  
   - Participants debated whether depth extraction is inherently part of the process, with references to the paper’s abstract clarifying that it predicts **monocular depth maps** directly from motion-blurred images.  

3. **Historical Context**:  
   - A user connected the research to early-2000s VFX workflows in films like *Scooby-Doo* and *Narnia*, highlighting parallels with legacy motion-recovery algorithms used in visual effects.  

4. **Humor and Off-Topic Threads**:  
   - Light-hearted exchanges included jokes about LLMs (Large Language Models) "taking over," misplaced mentions of **Rust programming**, and tongue-in-cheek remarks about making the world a better place. Another user humorously noted the lack of LLMs in the paper despite their mention in the comments.  

5. **Practical Applications**:  
   - A commenter speculated about potential uses for inverted radial/directional motion blur shaders, while others contrasted the method’s efficiency versus conventional deblurring approaches.  

Overall, the discussion blended technical scrutiny of the method’s innovations with nostalgia for past industry practices, alongside playful asides reflecting the community’s diverse engagement.

In a thought-provoking post, Amjad Masad, CEO of Replit, ignited a discussion by suggesting that learning to code might not be necessary in today's AI-driven world. His statements have stirred up the tech community, drawing over 4.5 million views and sparking a debate about the future of coding as a valuable skill. This discourse is particularly relevant for parents thinking about what skills to teach their children in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.

The writer, a seasoned web developer, reflects on coding's current state and its future, questioning whether traditional coding skills are becoming obsolete or merely evolving. Despite the explosive growth of AI, the fundamentals of coding remain unchanged, and understanding these basics is crucial for those starting out. While the convenience and power of AI as a coding assistant are undeniable, there is a risk of losing control and becoming overly dependent on technology, a cautionary note for both current and future developers.

AI, with its ever-increasing capabilities, raises concerns about reliance and control, as large language models monopolize decades of human knowledge and skills. The post argues that while AI enhances productivity, it should not replace fundamental coding skills. Coders are urged not to fall into the trap of 'vibe coding,' which could lead to being outcompeted in a market where everyone can potentially 'vibe code.'

The dialogue reflects a broader uncertainty about the role of coding in the future, emphasizing that despite AI’s allure, a solid understanding of traditional coding is invaluable. It suggests that aspiring programmers should focus on learning the basics to maintain control over their work and careers amidst the AI revolution. Ultimately, the writer celebrates AI's role in augmenting coding efficiency but remains grounded in the importance of foundational programming knowledge as an irreplaceable skill.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the role of AI in programming, with participants debating its benefits, limitations, and implications for developers of varying skill levels. Key points include:

1. **AI as a Tool vs. Skill Dependency**:  
   While AI (e.g., Claude, Cursor) accelerates code generation, users highlight its tendency to produce subtle errors or "gibberish," requiring time-consuming debugging. This raises concerns about over-reliance on AI without foundational coding knowledge. Novices risk becoming "vibe coders," producing superficially functional code without understanding underlying logic.

2. **Productivity vs. Control**:  
   AI excels at rote tasks (e.g., HTML/CSS scaffolding, boilerplate code), saving hours of manual work. However, users emphasize that meaningful problem-solving, architectural decisions, and debugging still demand human expertise. As one user notes, "AI is a force multiplier" but cannot replace high-skilled tasks like algorithm design or understanding browser rendering nuances.

3. **Skill-Level Impact**:  
   Low-skilled developers benefit most from AI, automating trivial tasks, while high-skilled developers use it to streamline workflows (e.g., generating template code). However, AI struggles with complex logic and context retention, forcing users to refine prompts iteratively or switch models/tools mid-task.

4. **Workflow Integration**:  
   Tools like Claude, Code Cursor, and IDE plugins embed AI into coding workflows, enforcing project-specific rules or style guides. Yet, users criticize their inconsistency—AI often ignores context, reinvents existing solutions, or fails to grasp project-specific patterns, leading to frustration.

5. **The Human-AI Balance**:  
   Participants agree that AI enhances productivity but stress the irreplaceable value of traditional skills. Experienced developers leverage AI for mundane tasks but rely on deep language/framework knowledge to diagnose issues and optimize outputs. As one user summarizes: "AI is a fantastic assistant, but it’s no substitute for understanding how code *actually* works."

**Conclusion**:  
While AI reshapes coding efficiency, the consensus underscores the enduring importance of foundational programming skills. Developers must balance AI's convenience with critical thinking and domain expertise to avoid becoming "prompt engineers" disconnected from core technical principles.
