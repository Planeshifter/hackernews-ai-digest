### AI tool designs mRNA vaccines that are more potent and stable

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01487-y) | 132 points | by [voisin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=voisin) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35847774)

Researchers from Baidu Research, a Beijing-based AI company, have developed an AI tool that optimizes gene sequences in mRNA vaccines, thereby creating more potent and stable jabs that can be deployed globally. The software uses computational linguistics to design mRNA sequences that are more intricate than currently used vaccines. This enables the genetic material to persist longer, leading to more antigens being produced by the bodyâ€™s protein-making machinery, resulting in more protective antibodies to fend off infectious diseases. The enhanced structural complexity of the mRNA also offers improved protection against vaccine degradation, eliminating the need for cold-chain equipment to handle such jabs.

The discussion on Hacker News covered a variety of topics including the technical aspects of the AI tool, copyright issues surrounding AI-generated content, and the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines in preventing the spread of COVID-19. One user pointed out that statistically-based papers linked to in the discussion about longer testing periods can be flawed in their analysis, while another argued that mRNA vaccines may pose a risk of rationing and double the rational vs. vector collision risk identified in vaccine production. Overall, there was a mix of technical analysis and ethical concerns about the use and distribution of mRNA vaccines.

### Intel OEM Private Key Leak: A Blow to UEFI Secure Boot Security

#### [Submission URL](https://securityonline.info/intel-oem-private-key-leak-a-blow-to-uefi-secure-boot-security/) | 627 points | by [transpute](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=transpute) | [352 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35843566)

MSI suffered a cyberattack in April by ransomware group Money Message, resulting in the exfiltration of 1.5TB of data, including the Intel OEM private key. The key is used to control Intel Boot Guard digital signatures which validate programs before operating system start-up, and could compromise the security of UEFI secure boot. The leaked key affects Intel's 11th, 12th and 13th generation processors and their original equipment manufacturers, including Lenovo and Supermicro. The full extent of the private key leaks remains unclear, although it is known that they impact at least 166 MSI products.

A few users contended that the best way to combat the potential security implications of the key's loss is to have a backup option in place, one that is secured in a disconnected system. Other users suggested that individuals should remain vigilant and pay attention to security updates given that UEFI implementations on most computers allow physical access to disable secure boot, while some users expressed concerns about balancing security and freedom to choose software.

### Qdrant: Vector Database for the next generation of AI applications

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant) | 22 points | by [nateb2022](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nateb2022) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35844724)

Qdrant is a vector similarity search engine and database tailored to extended filtering support. It is useful for all sorts of neural-network or semantic-based matching, faceted search, and other applications. Qdrant is written in Rust ðŸ¦€, which makes it fast and reliable even under high load. With Qdrant, embeddings or neural network encoders can be turned into full-fledged applications for matching, searching, recommending, and much more! The engine provides a production-ready service with a convenient API to store, search, and manage points, which are vectors with an additional payload. Qdrant offers a variety of client libraries, including Rust, Go, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Elixir, PHP, Ruby, and Java. It also offers a REST API and a gRPC interface for faster production-tier searches and supports filtering and payload, rich data types, query planning and payload indexes, SIMD hardware acceleration, write-ahead logging, and distributed deployment.

In the discussion, a user here4U praises Qdrant's vector similarity search engine and scalability. They mention that it is useful for neural-network or semantic-based matching and provides an API to manage points. Another user chxr remarks that they prefer Pinecone DB because it immediately connects to the internet, generates fewer files on disk, and is simple and fast. However, in response to a comparison with Qdrant and Pinecone, user ndr-z shares a benchmark link that suggests Qdrant performs better than Pinecone in terms of indexing time, search time, and memory usage.

### Using ChatGPT to generate a GPT project end-to-end

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ixaxaar/VardaGPT/blob/master/STORY.md) | 228 points | by [ixaxaar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ixaxaar) | [204 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35839536)

A programmer wondered about the impact of ChatGPT on programming and decided to test it out by attaching a memory module to a GPT. They used ChatGPT-4 to generate the project foundations, step by step, and even wrote unit tests. After a few weekend hours, they created VardaGPT, a repository entirely generated by ChatGPT-4. The experience was neither like working with a pair programmer nor a product manager scenario, but more like handholding a fresh grad who had absorbed all human knowledge. It was tiring but a differential productivity multiplier. The experiment concluded that the programmer's job is safe, at least for now. The aside adds that ChatGPT is also great at generating Agda and could be used to formalize all of pure math.

The discussion on Hacker News included conversations about the limitations and future potential of ChatGPT for programming, with one commenter noting that AI programming is not a threat to humansâ€”at least, not yet. Some commenters suggested that the future of AI in programming will eliminate human intervention entirely, while others highlighted the importance of high-quality human programmers and the value of their ability to make judgements and explain things in natural language. One commenter shared their experience subscribing to ChatGPT and using it to generate limited programming prompts, while another experimented with using the GPT-4 API to generate a table of data.

### It looks like GPT-4-32k is rolling out

#### [Submission URL](https://community.openai.com/t/it-looks-like-gpt-4-32k-is-rolling-out/194615) | 255 points | by [freediver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=freediver) | [182 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35841460)

AI language model GPT-4-32k is rolling out its API, and developers are already starting to experiment with its capabilities. Some lucky users were quick to gain access to the new model and have been sharing their experiences on Hacker News. The GPT-4-32k model boasts an impressive 32,000 token context length, which allows it to generate much more in-depth and nuanced responses to inputs than its predecessors. However, not all users have gained access yet, and the rollout seems to be happening at different rates based on capacity. Nonetheless, anticipation for GPT-4-32k is high, and developers are eager to try it out for themselves.

While some users believe that GPT-4-32k is overhyped, others are excited about its potential. There is a discussion about how to calculate the total number of pages of context for 32k tokens, with different opinions put forth. Moreover, there is a discussion about how to handle long texts and conversations in the context of GPT models, and how different tools and strategies can be employed. There are also discussions about the request limit, cost, and pricing of GPT-4-32k, batch processing, and how to optimize the performance.
