### Homemade liquid nitrogen generator Joule Thomson throttle (2013)

#### [Submission URL](http://homemadeliquidnitrogen.com/) | 57 points | by [ssutch3](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ssutch3) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40284495)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about a fascinating project involving the creation of a homemade liquid nitrogen generator using Joule Thomson Throttling. The author of the project noticed a lack of accessible tutorials on how the average person can liquefy nitrogen or air and decided to fill that gap. The tutorial covers the basic theory of cryogenic liquefaction and provides detailed steps for building a nitrogen gas liquefier using regenerative cooling techniques.

The author discusses three main methods for making liquid nitrogen, including using a cryocooler, a turbo expander, or throttling pressurized gas. They focus on the Joule-Thomson effect, where the temperature of a gas drops as it expands, and explain the process of cooling the gas prior to expansion to allow for condensation and liquefaction.

While the theory behind the project is relatively simple and available in books and online, the application and construction of a working device are challenging. The author successfully liquefied air and plans to demonstrate how others can replicate this process at home. The project utilizes a homemade pressure swing adsorber to supply nitrogen gas to the generator.

Additionally, the author has developed a reliable cryogenic thermometer at a fraction of the cost of commercial models, which will be available for purchase soon. The thermometer has a wide temperature range, high stability, and an LCD display for easy reading in various lighting conditions.

For those interested in more projects, the author also offers tutorials on induction heating and has various videos on YouTube under the handle "imsmooth." The project showcases a blend of DIY ingenuity, scientific exploration, and practical applications for enthusiasts seeking to delve into the world of cryogenics and temperature measurement devices.

### Meta String: A more space-efficient string encoding than UTF-8 in Fury

#### [Submission URL](https://fury.apache.org/blog/fury_meta_string_37_5_percent_space_efficient_encoding_than_utf8/) | 72 points | by [chaokunyang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chaokunyang) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40285571)

The latest submission on Hacker News discusses a new string encoding algorithm called meta string encoding in Fury. This algorithm aims at efficiently encoding meta strings such as field names, namespace, packageName, className, path, and filename by using 5/6 bits instead of the standard 8 bits in utf-8 encoding. By representing characters in a smaller range of 0~32, significant space savings of up to 37.5% are achieved compared to utf-8 encoding.

The algorithm offers two main encoding patterns: LOWER_SPECIAL and LOWER_UPPER_DIGIT_SPECIAL. The former encodes lowercase characters using 5 bits and special characters like ._$|, while the latter includes uppercase letters and digits using 6 bits. By having a flag to strip the last character, it ensures efficient encoding without loss of data.

The provided code snippets showcase the encoding and decoding process in Java and Golang, respectively. The selection strategy involves using the LOWER_SPECIAL encoding for mostly lowercase characters and dynamically choosing between the two patterns based on the encoded size for strings with uppercase characters.

This innovative approach to string encoding not only reduces storage requirements but also optimizes network transfer speeds, making it a promising solution for serialization systems dealing with meta strings.

The discussion on the latest submission about the meta string encoding algorithm in Fury entails insights into various aspects of the proposed encoding method. Some users point out that while the algorithm efficiently compresses meta strings and achieves significant space savings, it may not be optimal for all scenarios. There are discussions on the potential benefits of using zstd for compression and the considerations for dictionary encoding in serialization frameworks like Fury. The conversation also covers topics such as statistical compression, custom encoding schemes, and the trade-offs between space savings and complexity. Additionally, there is a debate about the effectiveness of Huffman encoding for small strings and the comparison with existing compression schemes like Unicode compression. Overall, the users engage in a detailed exploration of the strengths and limitations of the meta string encoding algorithm in Fury and suggest potential enhancements and alternative approaches for consideration.
