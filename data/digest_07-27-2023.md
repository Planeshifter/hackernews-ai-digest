### Absolute Unit NNs: Regression-Based MLPs for Everything

#### [Submission URL](https://gwern.net/aunn) | 16 points | by [nirvael](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nirvael) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36891609)

A proposal has been put forward for a general neural network (NN) architecture that can handle arbitrary tasks and scale up MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons). The architecture, called Absolute Unit NN (AUNN), aims to enable meta-learning prediction of arbitrary data inputs and outputs. The training data is encoded into a list, and the NN is trained to predict from the one-dimensional unit input of the absolute index of a data point to that data point unit. This allows the NN to generalize and rapidly learn new datapoints in a single gradient descent step. The AUNN architecture has several advantages, including simplicity, minimal inductive bias, generality of input/output, and hardware-friendliness. It also has potential applications in language-conditioned AUNNs and modular brain AUNNs. However, one disadvantage is that it may require a large scale of data and compute before it can effectively generalize and meta-learn. The proposal draws inspiration from various existing NN architectures and methodologies, such as self-supervised Transformers, neural radiance fields, and meta-reinforcement learning. The goal is to extend the capabilities of MLPs to handle diverse input/output modalities without the need for complex and computationally expensive dense layers.

In the discussion on Hacker News, there were a couple of comments. One commenter mentioned that this proposal reminded them of non-verbal reasoning and index learning, providing a link to a related article. Another commenter expressed their enthusiasm for the proposal and described it as amazing, also sharing a link to a GitHub repository. In response to this comment, another user suggested that they are working on a similar project using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and mentioned that implementing it should not be too difficult.
