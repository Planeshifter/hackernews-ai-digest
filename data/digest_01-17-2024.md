#### [Submission URL](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/alphageometry-an-olympiad-level-ai-system-for-geometry/) | 519 points | by [FlawedReformer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FlawedReformer) | [160 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39029801)

Today, researchers Trieu Trinh and Thang Luong published their paper in Nature regarding their breakthrough AI system, AlphaGeometry. This system solves complex geometry problems at a level comparable to human Olympiad gold medalists. In a benchmarking test, AlphaGeometry solved 25 out of 30 Olympiad geometry problems within the time limit, while the previous state-of-the-art system only solved 10. The AI system combines a neural language model with a rule-bound deduction engine to find solutions, and it was trained using synthetic data generated by the researchers. AlphaGeometry's success in solving Olympiad-level geometry problems is a significant step in developing advanced AI systems with deep mathematical reasoning capabilities. The researchers have open-sourced the code and model, hoping that it will contribute to progress in mathematics, science, and AI.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission centers around various aspects of the AlphaGeometry AI system and its implications.
One commenter mentions that they enjoyed reading the paper and found it interesting, particularly because they have experience as a problem designer for Olympiad-style contests. They mention that while algebra and combinatorics problems can often be solved using brute force, geometry problems require a different approach. They express excitement about the progress being made with intelligent systems and mention their interest in seeing advancements in number theory and combinatorics.
Another commenter adds that in their experience, during the selection process for national math Olympiads, the committee chooses problems based on their originality and the ability to test creative thinking rather than advanced theorems. This leads to a discussion about the nature of great math problems and their impact on problem-solving skills.
One commenter raises a point about the structure and reasoning capabilities of the AlphaGeometry AI system. They mention that the system relies on a search process that involves generating random geometric constructions until a solution is found. They clarify that they do not perform brute force searches but rather use smart brute force, where heuristics and backtracking are involved. The commenter also notes that the approach works well for small problems and can solve geometry problems in less time compared to existing algorithms.
A couple of commenters engage in a discussion about the nature of reasoning and search problems. One commenter mentions that reasoning fundamentally involves a search problem, with humans making guesses and working through the details mechanically. They highlight that in the 1950s, researchers developed logic theorist programs that attempted to prototype reasoning. Another commenter adds that reasoning in mathematics can be challenging to quantify, given the complexity and number of possible combinations involved. They also mention the use of neural networks to extract heuristics from data.
There is also a brief discussion about the nature of human invention and abstraction, with one commenter mentioning the invention of abstract concepts like complex numbers and Fourier transforms by humans. The discussion touches on the role of neural networks in capturing abstract concepts and their ability to learn weights to work effectively.

Overall, the discussion revolves around the methodology and potential limitations of the AlphaGeometry system, the nature of reasoning and search problems, and the role of human invention in mathematics.

### ALOHA robot learns from humans to cook, clean, do laundry

#### [Submission URL](https://venturebeat.com/automation/stanfords-mobile-aloha-robot-learns-from-humans-to-cook-clean-do-laundry/) | 124 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [87 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39022996)

Researchers at Stanford University have developed a low-cost AI system called Mobile ALOHA (A Low-cost Open-source Hardware System for Bimanual Teleoperation) that trains mobile robots to perform complex tasks in various environments. The system addresses the high costs and technical challenges of training mobile bimanual robots that require guidance from human operators. Mobile ALOHA costs a fraction of off-the-shelf systems and can learn from as few as 50 human demonstrations. It extends the ALOHA system by mounting it on a wheeled base and allows simultaneous teleoperation of all degrees of freedom. The results show that the system can learn complex mobile manipulation tasks such as cooking a meal and performing housekeeping tasks. However, Mobile ALOHA is not yet suitable for tight environments and still requires full demonstrations by human operators. The researchers plan to improve the system by adding more degrees of freedom and reducing its volume. They also aim to make the robot more autonomous in the future.

The discussion on this submission revolves around a few key points. 
Firstly, there are comments discussing the potential implications of this technology, with concerns raised about privacy and surveillance.
