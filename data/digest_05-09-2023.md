Researchers at OpenAI have developed a methodology for using large language models to automatically generate and evaluate natural language explanations for neuron behavior in other language models. The team used GPT-4 to produce and score explanations for every neuron in GPT-2 and released a dataset of these explanations and scores. While the vast majority of the explanations scored poorly, the team identified over 1,000 neurons with explanations that accounted for most of the neuron's top-activating behavior. The researchers hope their work will lead to better techniques for generating higher-scoring explanations and to a rapid understanding of model computations.
