A groundbreaking development in protein research has emerged with the unveiling of AlphaProteo, an innovative AI system designed to create novel, high-strength protein binders for various biological and health applications. Published by the Protein Design and Wet Lab teams, this tool marks a significant advancement over traditional methods, which often require extensive experimental cycles to identify and optimize effective binders.

Proteins play a crucial role in every biological function, acting like keys that interact with one another to regulate processes within the body. While tools like AlphaFold have greatly enhanced our understanding of protein interactions, they fell short in generating entirely new proteins tailored for specific targets.

AlphaProteo aims to bridge this gap by leveraging advanced machine learning. It has demonstrated the ability to design protein binders that can effectively attach to several critical targets, including VEGF-A, a protein linked to cancer and diabetes. In tests, AlphaProteo showed remarkable success, with binding affinities ranging from 3 to 300 times stronger than existing methods. For instance, an impressive 88% of binder candidates designed for the viral protein BHRF1 successfully bound in experimental trials.

The significance of AlphaProteo extends beyond mere design; the system has the potential to streamline drug discovery, enhance biosensors, and improve our understanding of disease dynamics. Validation of AlphaProteo's outputs has been confirmed by research teams at the Francis Crick Institute, who found that some binders could inhibit SARS-CoV-2 from entering cells, showcasing their biological relevance.

Despite its strengths, AlphaProteo is not without limitations, having faced challenges in creating binders for certain targets, such as TNFα, which is involved in autoimmune diseases. Nonetheless, the introduction of AlphaProteo represents a promising leap forward in the world of protein engineering, paving the way for new research possibilities and therapeutic advancements.

In a recent discussion on Hacker News surrounding AlphaProteo, the new AI system for protein binder design, several key themes emerged:

1. **Advanced Techniques**: Commenters praised the innovative methods used in AlphaProteo, highlighting its superiority over traditional approaches. Notably, David Baker's recent work on RFdiffusion was mentioned as a similar attempt to design novel biocatalysts. The introduction of AlphaProteo could significantly enhance biocatalyst designs, although achieving this is still a work in progress.

2. **Impact on Drug Discovery**: The potential implications of AlphaProteo for drug development and biosensor enhancement were widely acknowledged. Some users emphasized its ability to target complex biological pathways, which could lead to significant advancements in medical applications.

3. **Research Validation**: Many participants noted validation efforts from institutions like the Francis Crick Institute, where binders have shown promise in inhibiting viruses like SARS-CoV-2. This adds to the credibility of AlphaProteo in real-world applications.

4. **Challenges and Limitations**: While AlphaProteo shows immense potential, challenges remain in designing binders for specific targets, such as TNFα, related to autoimmune diseases. Commenters discussed the ongoing need for research and refinement in this area.

5. **Future of Protein Engineering**: There was a consensus that AlphaProteo represents a significant advancement in protein engineering, with the potential to inspire further research in the field, particularly in creating effective therapeutic agents.

### US and UK sign legally enforceable AI treaty

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24236980/us-signs-legally-enforceable-ai-treaty) | 5 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41460711)

In a historic move, the US, UK, and EU have joined forces to establish the first legally binding treaty on artificial intelligence, known as the Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence. This treaty aims to ensure that AI development aligns with fundamental principles like human rights, democracy, and legal standards. Signatories—also including countries like Andorra, Norway, and Israel—commit to creating laws that support transparency and data protection in AI systems.

While the treaty signifies a pivotal step toward responsible AI governance, it faces challenges concerning enforcement. Compliance will primarily rely on monitoring rather than robust sanctions for violations. Nonetheless, this treaty could set a precedent for AI legislation worldwide, as countries actively work on their own regulations.

Council of Europe Secretary General Marija Pejčinović Burić emphasized the need for AI to enhance societal standards rather than undermine them, highlighting this treaty's potential as a guiding framework. The treaty is expected to take effect three months after five countries ratify it. 

As the world grapples with rapid AI advancements, this development could serve as a roadmap for balancing innovation with ethical considerations.

The discussion surrounding the newly established Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence primarily revolves around the treaty's structure, implications, and potential challenges. 

1. **Official Release**: Some users shared links to the official Council of Europe release related to the treaty.
  
2. **Enforcement Concerns**: Participants expressed skepticism about the treaty's enforceability. One commenter noted that ratification in the U.S. would require Congress and significant public discourse, suggesting that the treaty might struggle to navigate the American legislative landscape.

3. **Privacy Protections**: Several comments highlighted specific articles within the treaty concerning privacy and data protection measures. User concerns focused on how well these provisions would be implemented and monitored, acknowledging the importance of maintaining individual privacy in the context of AI systems.

4. **Legal and Compliance Support**: There was discussion on the necessity for parties to maintain effective legal frameworks to ensure compliance with the treaty's goals, emphasizing the need for robust remedies against violations of human rights linked to AI use.

Overall, while the treaty is seen as a positive development towards AI governance, there are notable concerns about its implementation and the challenges posed by varying legislative procedures across signatory countries.
