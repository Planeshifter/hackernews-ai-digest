#### [Submission URL](https://iliao2345.github.io/blog_posts/arc_agi_without_pretraining/arc_agi_without_pretraining.html) | 334 points | by [georgehill](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=georgehill) | [99 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43259182)

In a fascinating exploration published by Isaac Liao and Albert Gu, a new approach called CompressARC challenges traditional AI methodologies by using lossless information compression as a cornerstone for achieving intelligent behavior. This concept isn't new; philosophers and scientists have long speculated that efficient compression could correlate to intelligence. Instead of debating this theory, the authors offer practical evidence using the ARC-AGI challenge—an AI benchmark testing abstract rule inference from minimal examples as seen in IQ-test-like puzzles.

CompressARC introduces a unique take: It avoids pretraining, doesn't rely on extensive datasets, and eschews exhaustive search. Instead, it leverages gradient descent, operating on just the target puzzle to produce a single output. Running on an RTX 4070, CompressARC achieved 34.75% accuracy on ARC-AGI's training set and 20% on its evaluation set, processing each puzzle in roughly 20 minutes. Remarkably, it claims to be the first neural solution where training data is limited solely to the problem at hand, sidestepping the need for pretrained models or immense computational resources.

Instead of vast datasets and models trained extensively beforehand, CompressARC focuses on in-the-moment learning—that is, it derives intelligence directly and dynamically through efficient compression techniques. This groundbreaking method nudges the AI community to rethink longstanding beliefs about model pretraining and data reliance. By focusing on compressive objectives and in-the-moment computation, CompressARC proposes an intriguing path for future AI development, turning minimal input into deeply intelligent responses.

As for ARC-AGI puzzles themselves, these are designed to challenge systems in a way that seemingly mimics human cognitive prowess. With puzzles ranging from pattern recall to shape dynamics, ARC-AGI aims to measure a system's ability to generalize and infer abstract rules. The average human can solve most of the training puzzles, but achieving similar success with machines has remained an ongoing challenge.

CompressARC's promising results highlight the potential of compression-based learning. Could this approach chart a new course toward unlocking the holy grail of artificial general intelligence (AGI)? While CompressARC's scores don't yet rival human capabilities, its paradigm shift might spark further innovations towards that coveted goal.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the nature of AGI, human intelligence, and the challenges faced by AI systems like CompressARC. Key points include:

1. **AGI Definition and Human Comparison**:  
   - Some argue that true AGI requires **understanding concepts, reasoning, and context**—not just pattern matching. Humans excel at integrating disparate information into a coherent worldview, a trait AI lacks.  
   - Others counter that even humans are specialized (e.g., years of training for jobs) but can **adapt rapidly** to new tasks, a flexibility AI has not yet achieved.  

2. **Role of Evolution and Pre-training**:  
   - Humans benefit from **millions of years of evolutionary "pre-training"** (innate instincts, sensory processing), which AI lacks. Newborns, for instance, have innate abilities like object recognition and folk physics.  
   - Skeptics note that AI systems like LLMs rely on vast datasets and architectures mimicking human knowledge, but they lack **embodied experience** or evolutionary grounding.  

3. **Limitations of Current AI**:  
   - Models like AlphaGo/AlphaZero generalize within narrow domains but are not AGI. They depend on **task-specific training data**, unlike humans who learn from diverse, lifelong experiences.  
   - **In-context learning** (e.g., Transformers) is criticized as "curve-fitting" rather than true understanding.  

4. **ARC-AGI Puzzles and Intelligence Metrics**:  
   - ARC-AGI puzzles test abstract reasoning (e.g., spatial relationships, topology), which humans solve using **innate cognitive frameworks**. Critics argue these puzzles may not measure "general intelligence" but rather specific, learned problem-solving.  
   - Some compare ARC challenges to tasks even animals (e.g., cocker spaniels) can solve, questioning their validity as AGI benchmarks.  

5. **Moravec’s Paradox**:  
   - Mentioned to highlight that **simple sensory-motor tasks** (easy for humans) are harder for AI than logical puzzles. This underscores the gap between AI and human-like generalization.  

**Takeaway**: The debate reflects skepticism about whether compression-based approaches like CompressARC—or current AI paradigms—can achieve AGI without incorporating evolutionary priors, embodied learning, or deeper conceptual understanding. Human intelligence remains a high bar, shaped by biology and experience that machines lack.

### Translating natural language to first-order logic for logical fallacy detection

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02318) | 243 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43257719)

In an effort to bridge the gap between natural language and formal logic, a new paper titled "NL2FOL: Translating Natural Language to First-Order Logic for Logical Fallacy Detection" has been published on arXiv. Authored by Abhinav Lalwani and colleagues, the work introduces a framework called NL2FOL. This cutting-edge tool utilizes Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language into First-Order Logic (FOL) step-by-step. It's a leap forward for natural language processing (NLP), tackling critical challenges like integrating implicit background knowledge.

An exciting application of this framework is its ability to detect logical fallacies, providing a fresh perspective on automated reasoning and misinformation tracking. Perhaps even more impressive is its ability to offer interpretable insights without needing model fine-tuning or labeled training data. NL2FOL excelled in tests, achieving an F1-score of 78% on the LOGIC dataset and an even better 80% on the LOGICCLIMATE dataset. This work marks a significant development in making computational reasoning more robust and accessible. For those interested, more details and the full paper can be accessed directly via the arXiv platform.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around the NL2FOL paper highlights both technical and philosophical debates about translating natural language (NL) to formal logic. Key points include:

1. **Formal Logic vs. Natural Language Nuance**:  
   - Users debate whether formal logic (e.g., First-Order Logic) can fully capture the complexity of natural language, which relies heavily on context, pragmatics, and implicit knowledge. References to **Montague semantics** and **Wittgenstein’s language games** underscore the philosophical challenges in mapping NL to rigid logical structures.  
   - Skepticism arises about whether step-by-step FOL translations can address real-world persuasive arguments, which often depend on rhetorical strategies rather than deductive validity.

2. **Practical Applications and Limitations**:  
   - While NL2FOL’s high F1-scores (78–80%) on LOGIC and LOGICCLIMATE datasets are praised, commenters question its real-world utility. Detecting fallacies in nuanced, context-rich texts (e.g., news articles) may require more than syntactic translation.  
   - Suggestions include using the tool to **highlight suspect sentences** in articles or assist in statistical literacy (e.g., debunking misleading claims in books like *How to Lie with Statistics*). However, users note that statistical arguments themselves can be fallacious if misapplied.

3. **Context and Interpretation Challenges**:  
   - Critics argue that NL interpretation is inherently ambiguous and context-dependent. For example, translating statements like *“Zelensky is ready to work with Trump’s leadership”* into FOL risks oversimplification without shared background knowledge.  
   - Some propose alternative frameworks like **Discourse Representation Theory** or **Universal Meaning Representations** to better handle pragmatics and implicit meaning.

4. **Skepticism About Automation**:  
   - Users caution against over-reliance on automated fallacy detection, emphasizing that human judgment and domain expertise remain critical. One commenter warns that blindly trusting such tools could lead to new forms of “predictive debate” errors.  

**Conclusion**:  
The discussion reflects cautious optimism about NL2FOL’s technical achievement but underscores unresolved challenges in bridging formal logic with the messy reality of human language. Philosophical debates about semantics and pragmatics, alongside practical concerns about context and over-automation, dominate the thread.
