#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) | 106 points | by [ksec](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ksec) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42028873)

In a noteworthy advancement for handling large datasets, a research paper titled "SPANN: Highly-efficient Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search" presents a cutting-edge memory-disk hybrid indexing and search system. Developed by Qi Chen and a team of eight researchers, SPANN aims to address the challenges faced by traditional approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms, particularly their inefficiency in managing massive databases.

SPANN adopts an innovative approach by utilizing an inverted index methodology, where centroid points of data are kept in memory, while the bulkier posting lists reside on disk. This structure not only enhances disk-access efficiency by minimizing the number of required accesses but also maintains high search recall rates by retrieving quality posting lists.

Key features include a hierarchical balanced clustering algorithm that optimizes posting list lengths and a dynamic query-aware mechanism that prunes unnecessary accesses during searches. Remarkably, SPANN outperforms the current leader, DiskANN, achieving recall rates of 90% for both the first and tenth nearest neighbors in just around a millisecond, all while utilizing only 32GB of memory. As the demand for efficient data retrieval grows, this research, accepted at NeurIPS 2021, demonstrates a significant leap in the scalability of data searches for AI and database applications. 

For those looking to delve deeper, the paper is accessible online, and the relevant code is available for further exploration.

In a thought-provoking exploration, Daniel Kharitonov delves into the intriguing world of LLMs (Large Language Models) and the intricacies of their guardrails designed to prevent misuse. He examines a medium-level risk scenario where users attempt to obtain medical diagnoses from AI, specifically focusing on Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro model. While the AI dutifully refrains from offering medical interpretations, it subtly hints at its capability by recognizing the X-ray image without being explicitly told.

Kharitonov tests the limits of these guardrails through a series of cleverly crafted prompts, revealing that while the model restrains itself from providing direct medical advice, it can be prompted to improve its requests significantly. By automating the process of generating effective prompts, the author successfully bypasses some of the model's restrictions, yielding responses that, despite disclaimers, resemble medically formatted reports.

The experiment showcases not only the sophistication of current AI technologies but also highlights the ethical considerations and potential risks associated with their deployment in sensitive fields like healthcare. This reflective piece serves as both a practical examination of prompt engineering and a cautionary tale about the unintended consequences of AI guardrails in the quest for automation and access to knowledge.

In the discussion surrounding Daniel Kharitonov's exploration of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their guardrails, several users shared intriguing insights and concerns. One participant, skntfnd, highlighted the paradoxical nature of LLM guardrails, stating that while they aim to prevent misuse, they often allow for circumvention through clever prompt engineering. They pointed to the statistical approach to evaluate attempts versus successes, suggesting that this could provide meaningful insights into the model's limitations.

Another user, _jonas, expressed curiosity about the integration of hardcoded guardrails and limitations in real-time models, referencing NVIDIA's Nemo Guardrails package. 

Bradley13 touched on the broader implications of LLMs in sensitive applications, drawing a parallel between guardrails and the complexities of other technologies like electronic music synthesis. There were concerns about the risk of users blindly trusting AI advice without due diligence, as raised by smcn, who mentioned historical issues with AI suggesting choices in critical areas such as medical diagnoses.

User ryv found interest in using prompts related to X-ray images but felt cautious about the implications of such approaches. There were also mentions of Google's plans to review customer prompts starting in November 2024 to strengthen safety and compliance, particularly around the use of generative AI.

Overall, the discussions reflected a blend of fascination, caution, and ethical consideration regarding the deployment of LLMs in high-stakes environments like healthcare.
