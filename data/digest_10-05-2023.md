### Can an Artificial Kidney Finally Free Patients from Dialysis?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39888-2) | 36 points | by [gardenfelder](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gardenfelder) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37782941)

Researchers have developed an implantable bioartificial kidney that could potentially revolutionize the treatment of end-stage renal disease. The bioartificial kidney contains a bioreactor with silicon nanopore membranes that can protect human renal epithelial cells from rejection. In a proof-of-concept study, the bioreactor was implanted into pigs without the need for immunosuppression therapy, and the cells maintained high viability and functionality for seven days. The results suggest that an implantable bioreactor for renal cell therapy using silicon nanopore membranes is feasible and could offer a viable alternative to kidney transplantation.

The discussion on this submission seems to be centered around the feasibility and potential benefits of the implantable bioartificial kidney. One commenter points out that chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension are often caused by poor lifestyle choices such as overeating, lack of exercise, and malnutrition. Another commenter shares personal anecdotes about family members who developed kidney disease despite living healthy lifestyles. 

There is also a brief exchange about the preference for technical solutions over behavioral therapy, with one commenter mentioning a medication called Ozempic as a successful treatment option. Finally, one user provides a previous link related to the topic, while another confirms the feasibility of the bioartificial kidney by highlighting the use of silicon nanopore membranes.

scaling capabilities and performance improvements demonstrate its potential to revolutionize autonomous driving. GAIA-1, a generative world model, leverages video, text, and action inputs to generate realistic driving videos with controllable features. By predicting future events, GAIA-1 enables autonomous vehicles to anticipate and plan their actions, enhancing safety and efficiency on the road. With over 9 billion trainable parameters and trained on a massive dataset of proprietary driving data, GAIA-1 represents a significant step forward in world modeling for autonomous driving. Its model architecture, training process, and scaling laws show similarities to large language models, indicating its potential for further improvement through data and compute scaling. As GAIA-1 continues to evolve and scale, it holds promise for achieving even greater proficiency and performance in video generation tasks, pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the capabilities and limitations of GAIA-1, the generative world model for autonomous driving. Some users argue that the large-scale language models (LLMs) used in GAIA-1 lack the ability to effectively extrapolate behavior beyond their training data, making them unreliable in real-world driving scenarios. They point out that autonomous driving technology is more complex and nuanced than LLMs can handle. 

Others counter this argument by highlighting that GAIA-1 is a significant advancement in world modeling and has the potential for further improvement through data and compute scaling. They believe that while human driving practices have their own flaws and limitations, AI-driven systems can still outperform humans in various tasks.

There is also a discussion about the definition and effectiveness of extrapolation in machine learning models. Some users express confusion over the concept, while others provide explanations and examples to clarify its meaning.

Overall, the discussion touches on various aspects of AI-driven autonomous driving, comparing it to human driving abilities and debating the potential of large-scale language models in this domain.

### Traveling words: a geometric interpretation of transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07315) | 79 points | by [d4rkp4ttern](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=d4rkp4ttern) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37778490)

A recent paper titled "Traveling Words: A Geometric Interpretation of Transformers" delves into the inner workings of transformer models in natural language processing. The researchers introduce a novel geometric perspective that sheds light on how transformers process and represent words. They propose that layer normalization confines the latent features to a hyper-sphere, allowing attention mechanisms to shape the semantic representation of words on this surface. The study validates these insights by analyzing a pre-trained 124M parameter GPT-2 model, revealing clear attention patterns and providing a deeper understanding of transformer operations. This geometric interpretation enhances the understanding of transformers as processes that model word particles' trajectory along the hyper-sphere.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the novelty and effectiveness of the geometric perspective introduced in the paper. One user, sfk, appreciates the paper's contribution to the field of geometric learning and mentions that it is an interesting theory paper. However, another user, dlftnk, suggests that a simpler approach might be more effective in tackling the problem of traveling words. Overall, the discussion focuses on the potential merits and limitations of the proposed geometric interpretation.

### Product Strategy in the Age of AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.intercom.com/blog/videos/intercom-on-product-ep21/) | 82 points | by [egman_ekki](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=egman_ekki) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37776105)

Today on Intercom on Product, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer Des Traynor sat down with Paul Adams, Chief Product Officer, to discuss product strategy in the age of AI. They explored the potential impact of AI on businesses and product development, as well as the challenges and opportunities it presents. 

One key takeaway is that in order for startups to truly disrupt industries with AI, they need to offer a unique attack angle that established companies can't easily replicate. While AI can streamline tasks in categories like sales and customer service, its impact on project management is more nuanced. As AI capabilities advance, people will likely become more comfortable relying on it for tasks that involve not just analysis but judgment, though human oversight will still be necessary.

Product managers should focus on how AI can expand the user base, enhance users' abilities, or eliminate tasks entirely. Startups and established companies alike would benefit from a deeper understanding of the concepts behind The Innovator's Dilemma.

Overall, Traynor and Adams are bullish about AI's potential to upend industries and transform product development. With the first wave of AI-native startups emerging and pushing the boundaries of what's possible, it's clear that AI is here to stay and will continue to shape the future of innovation.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various topics related to the impact and potential limitations of AI, as well as the history of disruptive technologies. Here are some key points from the discussion:

- Some commenters reflect on the slow adoption of smartphones in the early days and how successful mobile-native platforms like Uber, Snapchat, and TikTok emerged years after the release of the iPhone.
- There is debate about whether certain platforms like TikTok could have succeeded on desktop and whether SMS played a crucial role in the success of Uber.
- The availability and use of individual data is discussed, with arguments regarding the value and privacy implications of aggregated data versus individual data. Some assert that individual data is readily available and cheap, while others believe that aggregated data is more valuable and easier to analyze.
- The limitations and potential disruptions of AI are explored. Some commenters express skepticism about the ability of AI to disrupt industries, while others argue that the hype around AI is similar to past trends and that entrepreneurs should focus on solving real problems rather than chasing buzzwords.
- The discussion touches on the concept of hype cycles and the need for a differentiated strategy in product development. Some commenters caution against following trends blindly, emphasizing the importance of creating value and meeting real market needs.

Overall, the discussion delves into the nuances and challenges surrounding AI and disruptive technologies, providing different perspectives on their impact and potential limitations.
