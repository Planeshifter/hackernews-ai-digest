### Honey, I shrunk {fmt}: bringing binary size to 14k and ditching the C++ runtime

#### [Submission URL](https://vitaut.net/posts/2024/binary-size/) | 236 points | by [karagenit](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=karagenit) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41415238)

In a recent exploration of the {fmt} formatting library, developers are thrilled to see its compact binary size continue to shrink—now boasting a reduced footprint of just 71KB after disabling locale support. The library, which is favored for its efficiency over traditional alternatives like IOStreams and Boost Format, leverages clever type-erasure techniques to streamline format operations, which not only enhances compile times but also minimizes the size of the resulting executable.

With its unique design, {fmt} ensures that formatting errors can be caught at compile time, thus offering more robust runtime safety compared to C-style printf. Developers have been investigating further optimizations, and in testing on an aarch64 Ubuntu system, they've observed a consistent ability to maintain smaller sizes despite recent upgrades, including the introduction of the Dragonbox algorithm for better floating-point formatting.

The focus on binary size isn't arbitrary; there's a growing appeal among developers working with memory-constrained systems—including retro computing enthusiasts—leading to more interest in creating a lightweight library. As the maintainers continue their work, the prospect of reducing the library size even further remains a key goal, benefitting not just traditional software development but also niche applications in older, resource-limited environments.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implementation and optimization of the {fmt} formatting library, particularly its ability to maintain a small binary size and its design principles. 

1. **Binary Size and C++ Standards**: Users discuss how the {fmt} library's default behavior contrasts with traditional C++ standards, particularly noting that the C++20 committee failed to address issues with default behaviors in formatting functions. Some participants express concern over the lack of consistency in the language's handling of localized settings and defaults.

2. **Floating Point Formatting**: The conversation highlights the introduction of the Dragonbox algorithm for improved floating-point formatting. Several users share their experiences and results of using the algorithm, emphasizing its efficiency compared to past methods and the benefits it brings in terms of performance.

3. **Comparison with Zig Language**: Users compare the {fmt} library with the Zig programming language, noting Zig's own approaches to floating-point formatting and binary size reduction. Comments point out how Zig's compiler generates smaller binaries due to its linking strategies.

4. **Compiler and Allocation Details**: There are deeper discussions about C++'s memory management and the impact of different allocators on binary size. Contributors debate best practices for managing defaults and constructors, suggesting various methods for optimizing allocation and reducing overhead.

5. **Performance Insights**: Some participants provide performance benchmarks and insights from their experiments with the {fmt} library, noting that smaller binary sizes could simplify deployment, especially in constrained environments. They also discuss the trade-offs related to performance gains versus code complexity.

Overall, the conversation reflects a keen interest in both the technical details of the {fmt} library's design and its alignment with broader trends in programming language development, particularly regarding efficiency and memory management in C++.

### Waymo driverless vehicle re-routes into oncoming traffic

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/31/business/video/waymo-driverless-car-wrong-way-traffic-arizona-digvid) | 46 points | by [breadwinner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=breadwinner) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41418464)

In a startling incident involving autonomous technology, a Waymo self-driving taxi turned into oncoming traffic while carrying a passenger in Arizona, a moment captured on video. Fortunately, no one was injured during the mishap. This event has reignited discussions around the safety and reliability of driverless vehicles, underlining the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement of autonomous systems. Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet, is at the forefront of these technological advancements, but incidents like this raise questions about readiness for widespread adoption.

The discussion surrounding the Waymo incident features a mix of reactions highlighting concerns about self-driving technology. Users engage with various points, including:

1. **Driver Behavior**: Some commenters indicate that human tendencies, such as driving in the wrong direction on one-way streets, can complicate the perception of self-driving vehicle safety.
  
2. **Video Analysis**: There’s examination of the video, where some mention that it doesn’t show clear reasons for the vehicle’s action, while others suggest it highlights specific scenarios where autonomous vehicles may struggle—like handling left turns at busy intersections.

3. **General Safety Concerns**: Participants express skepticism about the readiness of self-driving technology, pointing to human-like errors in decision-making processes, particularly in clear traffic situations.

4. **Local Driving Characteristics**: Commenters compare driving behaviors in various cities, suggesting that the challenges for both human drivers and autonomous systems might vary significantly based on regional driving norms.

5. **Legal and Technical Aspects**: Some raise questions about the legality and technical system reliability of autonomous features, emphasizing the need for accountability when algorithms make potentially dangerous driving decisions.

Overall, the discourse reflects a mix of skepticism about autonomous systems’ safety and acknowledgment of complex human driving behaviors that can impact the evaluation of such technologies.
