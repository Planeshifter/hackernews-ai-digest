### Explaining Large Language Models Decisions Using Shapley Values

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01332) | 85 points | by [veryluckyxyz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=veryluckyxyz) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42527496)

In a recent update on arXiv, researcher Behnam Mohammadi introduces a thought-provoking paper titled "Explaining Large Language Models Decisions Using Shapley Values." Published on March 29, 2024, the study delves into the burgeoning realm of large language models (LLMs) and their application in understanding human behavior and cognitive processes. Mohammadi raises critical concerns about the efficacy of using LLMs as substitutes for human subjects, citing significant discrepancies that highlight differing underlying mechanisms and the models' sensitivity to prompt changes.

Utilizing Shapley values from cooperative game theory, Mohammadi proposes an innovative method to interpret LLM behavior, focusing on the influence of each prompt component on the model's output. Through experiments, the paper reveals "token noise"—a phenomenon where certain less informative tokens disproportionately affect decision-making. This insight urges researchers to exercise caution in drawing parallels between LLM outputs and human behavior, particularly in survey settings.

Essentially, this research emphasizes the importance of rigorously analyzing LLM responses, suggesting that practitioners should optimize their prompting strategies to reduce biases and enhance the reliability of insights drawn from these advanced computational models. لUpon exploring this paper, readers are encouraged to reflect on the validity of LLMs in simulating human cognition, fostering a deeper understanding of the implications of artificial intelligence in decision-making processes.

In a recent discussion sparked by Behnam Mohammadi's paper on interpreting large language models (LLMs) using Shapley values, commenters engaged in a multifaceted debate about the limitations and implications of LLMs in mimicking human cognition and decision-making.

Key points raised included:

1. **Effectiveness of Models**: Some participants expressed skepticism about the ability of LLMs, including newer models like Llama 3, to replicate human cognitive processes accurately. Concerns were raised about discrepancies in performance when prompts are altered, which could distort results.

2. **Review Processes and Standards**: Several comments focused on the challenges of academic peer review, specifically mentioning the pressure to publish and the quality of submissions. Some participants critiqued the review system for potentially allowing lower-quality papers while favoring established authors, thus complicating the landscape of scientific discourse.

3. **Heuristics and Methodological Concerns**: The discourse acknowledged that heuristics and biases often affect how research is interpreted, particularly in how LLMs are assessed. Commenters expressed frustration with a perceived lack of rigor in distinguishing LLM outputs from human responses.

4. **Implications for Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Several contributors reflected on the philosophical and ethical implications of relying on AI for tasks that traditionally involve human judgment. There was a consensus that while LLMs can provide insights, they should not replace human reasoning before validating their decisions rigorously.

5. **Call for Caution**: Overall, many remarked on the need for caution when drawing parallels between LLM behaviors and human cognition. The community seemed to agree on the necessity of improving prompting strategies to mitigate biases and better understand the models' outputs.

The discussion highlighted both the excitement about advances in AI and the critical need for thoughtful analysis of their capabilities and limitations in understanding human-like decision-making.

### Tech worker movements grow as threats of RTO, AI loom

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/12/from-ai-to-rto-unpopular-policies-may-fuel-tech-worker-movements-in-2025/) | 24 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42530970)

In a year marked by unrest in the tech sector, workers have begun to push back against stagnating wages and return-to-office mandates, leading to a burgeoning labor movement across major companies such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. The Tech Workers Coalition (TWC) reports that tech workers are more organized than ever, with union efforts gaining traction and recently resulting in wage increases and better conditions. 

Milestones include the first unionized Apple Store's labor contract, a favorable ruling from the National Labor Relations Board for YouTube Music contract workers at Google, and Amazon’s significant investment of $2.2 billion aimed at raising warehouse wages. The trend is catalyzed by heightened discontent over layoffs—like Microsoft's cut of 650 gaming jobs—and dissatisfaction with unpopular workplace policies, including rigorous return-to-office rules that threaten work-life balance.

Activists believe the momentum will carry into 2025, as the current climate encourages workers, especially in the video game sector, to organize and push for even more significant gains. With a complex interplay of economic pressures and a unified push for workers' rights, the landscape for tech workers may be on the cusp of transformative change, with labor groups gearing up to support and expand these efforts in the year ahead.

The discussion appears to revolve around the complexities and struggles faced by tech workers, particularly those on H1-B visas, within the current labor climate. One commenter highlights issues with political perceptions and prosecution related to tech employment practices, suggesting that there is a disparity in how labor issues are treated, especially for immigrant workers. 

Another participant brings up the connection between cultural and economic factors, emphasizing that while tech skills remain crucial, there are deeper systemic issues affecting job security and the treatment of employees in the tech sector. Overall, the dialogue suggests a growing awareness of the challenges tech workers face, particularly in the context of workplace policies and legal frameworks. The tone indicates a concern for the rights of workers, especially in the wake of layoffs and economic pressures.
