### RT-2 AI model translates vision and language into robotic actions

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-rt2-robotics-vla-model/) | 162 points | by [BhattMayurJ](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BhattMayurJ) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36905076)

Google DeepMind has unveiled its new vision-language-action (VLA) model, Robotics Transformer 2 (RT-2), which enables robots to better understand and perform actions in both familiar and new situations. Unlike traditional robot learning methods that involve training robots on billions of data points, RT-2 uses a small amount of robot training data and transfers concepts from its language and vision training data to direct robot actions. In testing, RT-2 performed as well as its predecessor on trained tasks and almost doubled its performance on novel tasks. This advancement brings us closer to a future of helpful robots that can rapidly adapt to new environments and situations.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the capabilities and limitations of Google DeepMind's new Robotics Transformer 2 (RT-2) model. Some users express skepticism about the model's understanding of detailed movements and its ability to handle complex tasks. Others highlight the challenges of reverse-engineering the cognitive processes involved in human movements. There is also a discussion about the collection and generalization of data for machine learning models and the potential implications of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Some users provide additional resources for further reading on the subject.

### WebArena: A realistic web environment for building autonomous agents

#### [Submission URL](https://webarena.dev/) | 78 points | by [jeron](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jeron) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36901815)

WebArena is a web environment for building autonomous agents, and it's now available for users to try out. With functionality and data designed to mimic real-world scenarios, WebArena creates websites from popular categories like social forums, online shopping, content management, and more. It also includes tools and knowledge resources to help agents emulate human problem-solving. One interesting feature of WebArena is its benchmark for interpreting high-level natural language commands and executing web-based interactions. It offers a set of realistic tasks that require long-term planning and reasoning capabilities, such as finding art museums in Pittsburgh, optimizing travel itineraries, and updating README files. Users can explore the WebArena website demos and even try out the tasks themselves. This tool could be a valuable resource for developers and researchers working on autonomous agents and natural language understanding.

The discussion on this submission includes various comments from Hacker News users. 

- ngc6677 points out that WebArena's content URL allows users to discover information paths, such as CSS, DOM attributes, form input values, and more. They mention that the content URL can represent attributes like VL, which could be useful for representing human relationships.
- chrswkly highlights the functionality of WebArena, noting that it creates websites in popular categories and mimics real-world scenarios. They also mention the benchmark that allows high-level natural language commands to be interpreted and executed. The benchmark tasks include finding art museums in Pittsburgh, optimizing travel itineraries, and updating README files.
- rpn raises a question about the submission's longevity on the front page of Hacker News, considering that it has been there for 10 hours with only 39 points and 4 comments. They wonder if front-page comments are an indicator of the submission's value.
- bthndrk makes a comment about the font used in the submission, referring to it as "Google Sans."
- numpad0 finds the name "WebArena" somewhat unfortunate as there is a major VPS web hosting brand with a similar name.
- lcrmcd does not provide any additional information on the topic.

Overall, the discussion covers various aspects of WebArena and raises some questions and observations related to the submission.

### Real life indirection is the root of all evil, and AI agents can fix it

#### [Submission URL](https://marianogappa.github.io/software/2023/07/28/real-life-indirection-is-the-root-of-all-evil-and-ai-agents-can-fix-it/) | 29 points | by [maloga](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=maloga) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36906175)

A recent blog post explores the concept of "indirection in the real world" and how it can lead to negative consequences. Indirection, a principle in computer programming, is not inherently bad, but too much of it can lead to difficulty in understanding code or navigating complicated systems. The author argues that indirection is present in various aspects of daily life, such as relying on others for food, shelter, and safety. While indirection has led to improvements in society, it also contributes to issues like war, inequality, obesity, and political corruption. The post suggests that transparency is a key solution to mitigate these problems by removing the indirection and exposing the underlying issues. Examples of transparency efforts include health warnings on packaging and whistleblowing to expose tax evasion and hidden wealth.

There are several discussions happening in the comments section of the post.

1. User "ndsrnm" criticizes the Finnish school system, claiming that national curriculum standards in schools, including privately approved government instances, are ineffective. They argue that local municipality monitoring and progress assessments are necessary and that for-profit private schools should not exist. They suggest that Norwegians who can afford it will go to Sweden for excellent education.

2. User "lghttwr" mentions that AI can help supermarket teams like competing brands, such as Kellogg's and Procter & Gamble, to create packaging that appeals to people. They claim that the marketing team's focus is to make the cheaper product look more marketable, even if it's of lower quality.

3. User "mschuster91" disagrees, saying that AI can't help supermarkets and gives an example of barcode scanning products to filter out inferior ones.

4. User "Telemakhos" argues that it doesn't matter if consumers choose the cheapest product, as it's the shopper's responsibility to choose based on price and brand. They believe that AI assistants can assist by providing relevant historical information about brands and marketing.

5. User "pavel_lishin" simply comments "AI gnt."

6. User "mstrmnn" comments on the number of followers an "hmn ntllgnt gnt" has, suggesting that it's not a bad start for a movement.

7. User "pie420" brings up the issue of AI-generated spam and mentions that AI is what controls wherever the biggest spend budgets.

In another discussion:

1. User "nologic01" expresses concern about AI agents causing indirect funds, designs, buildings, runs, and understanding of black box algorithms, empowering corrupt entities. They note that the information technology industry is favoring highly centralized and controlled configurations, which is leading society towards the opposite of empowerment.

2. User "hmnstbt" suggests reading a documentary called "The Corporation," which discusses the consequences of decisions made by corporations and their impact on regular people.

3. User "Nasrudith" comments on the lack of self-awareness in society, stating that people often ignore the consequences of their decisions.

4. User "vgcrrctn" argues against the claim that capitalism is the cause of many negative things, stating that metaphors play a significant role in communication.

5. User "mstrmnn" refers to semiotics and suggests looking up the field of study to understand the power of metaphors.

6. User "vgcrrctn" responds, stating that the previous comment was misunderstood, and there is no disagreement about the importance of metaphors.

Finally, user "sprktby" marks the discussion as "dd" (done and dusted).
