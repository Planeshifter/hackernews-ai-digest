#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23168) | 163 points | by [og_kalu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=og_kalu) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42017048)

A new paper titled "TokenFormer: Rethinking Transformer Scaling with Tokenized Model Parameters," authored by a team of eight researchers led by Haiyang Wang, proposes a novel approach to tackling the significant costs associated with scaling transformer models. Currently, modifying architectural components within transformers often necessitates retraining the entire model from scratch, which becomes impractical as model sizes burgeon.

TokenFormer introduces a unique architecture that optimizes how model parameters are handled. Instead of treating the parameters as fixed entities, the model interprets them as tokens, enabling what the authors call a "token-parameter attention layer." This innovative approach allows for flexible scaling from 124 million to 1.4 billion parameters without the need for extensive retraining. The result is a system that matches the performance of traditional transformers while significantly reducing computational expenses.

This research may signal a new horizon in the efficiency and scalability of machine learning models, making it easier and less costly for developers to enhance their models over time. The full paper is available for those interested in exploring this groundbreaking work further.

#### [Submission URL](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2024/10/from-naptime-to-big-sleep.html) | 142 points | by [sigmar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sigmar) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42017771)

In a groundbreaking development, the Big Sleep team, a collaboration between Google Project Zero and Google DeepMind, has successfully utilized large language models (LLMs) to discover a previously unknown exploitable vulnerability in SQLite, a commonly used open-source database engine. This achievement marks a significant milestone in AI-assisted cybersecurity, highlighting the potential of LLMs in identifying complex memory-safety issues in real-world software before they can be exploited.

Originally launched as Project Naptime, the framework evolved into Big Sleep and demonstrated its capabilities by uncovering a critical stack buffer underflow vulnerability in SQLite. This discovery was promptly reported and fixed by the developers, ensuring that no users were affected by the flaw. This incident illustrates the transformative potential of AI in proactive defense strategies, allowing vulnerabilities to be rectified before they can pose a threat.

One interesting aspect of the identified vulnerability involved the mishandling of sentinel values in unconventionally indexed fields. The LLM was particularly effective in going beyond traditional fuzzing methods, which often fail to catch nuanced variant issues in code. Instead, by leveraging insights from previously patched vulnerabilities, the AI agent was able to examine recent code commits and pinpoint weaknesses that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.

This first public instance of AI identifying an exploitable issue underscores a promising shift in cybersecurity practices, suggesting that AI tools may provide a crucial advantage to defenders in the ongoing battle against vulnerabilities. The Big Sleep team's work not only enhances the resilience of widely used software like SQLite but also fosters hope that similar approaches can be scaled and replicated to ensure safer software development practices in the future.

The discussion surrounding the Big Sleep project's discovery of a vulnerability in SQLite reveals a mix of skepticism and optimism regarding the role of AI in cybersecurity. Some commenters raise concerns that the AI's ability to find vulnerabilities may not be as revolutionary as portrayed, citing past efforts like DARPA's Cyber Grand Challenge which also aimed to apply AI in real-world contexts. They argue that while AI can aid in identifying vulnerabilities, the true impact may be limited, especially if human oversight and testing remain essential.

Others support the potential of LLMs to streamline vulnerability detection, noting that traditional methods like fuzzing often miss complex issues. There’s recognition that AI tools could enhance efficiency and lower costs in security research, though it will require careful integration with human expertise. Some participants discuss their personal projects related to vulnerability detection using AI, indicating a growing interest in this area of research.

Overall, the conversation reflects a cautious but hopeful outlook on LLMs in cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for balance between AI capabilities and human validation in the quest to identify and fix software vulnerabilities.

### Apple silently uploads your passwords and keeps them

#### [Submission URL](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/10/4.html) | 158 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42014588)

A recent blog post has revealed a troubling quirk in Apple's iCloud Keychain feature that may leave users unaware of their data being uploaded and stored. The author details their experience upgrading from macOS Ventura to Sonoma, during which iCloud Keychain was enabled without their consent. Shockingly, after disabling the feature, they discovered that passwords had already been uploaded to iCloud, a fact obscured because iCloud Keychain must be turned on to view its contents.

Despite their intention to keep personal data off iCloud, the user's passwords were ultimately synced across devices due to a silent activation of iCloud Keychain during the upgrade process. They uncovered that disabling iCloud Keychain does not remove the stored data from Apple's servers, raising concerns about the privacy and permanence of what users thought they had deleted. 

After manual deletion of passwords and further experimentation, the user found a workaround that kept their Mac mini iCloud Keychain-free. However, they remain anxious about other potential data lingering in iCloud, such as Wi-Fi passwords. This situation has sparked significant discussions about user control over personal information in Apple's ecosystem and highlights potential flaws in Apple's data management policies.

The discussion surrounding the blog post about the Apple iCloud Keychain issue reflects a mix of frustration and concern among users over data privacy and control. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Silent Activation**: Users expressed alarm that iCloud Keychain could be activated silently during system updates, leading to unintended syncing of passwords without users' knowledge. Many felt their choices were undermined by this default behavior.
2. **Data Permanence**: There was significant anxiety over the inability to completely remove stored data from iCloud once it had been synced. This raised questions about what happens to deleted data and whether users ever truly regain control over their personal information.
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Some users brought up alternatives to iCloud Keychain, such as third-party password managers, emphasizing the need for more user-controlled and privacy-focused options. They discussed concerns about the implications of syncing credentials across devices without explicit consent.
4. **Technical Limitations**: Several commenters noted technical issues, such as problems with syncing passwords on Windows machines and the complexities of managing passwords across different ecosystems (e.g., Apple vs. Windows).
5. **General Distrust**: There was a broader theme of distrust toward major tech companies like Apple, especially regarding their handling of user data and consent. This distrust was fueled by the experiences shared in the thread, where users felt misled or forced into using services they would have otherwise opted out of.

Overall, the discussion highlighted deep concerns about user privacy in the tech landscape and the need for greater transparency and control over personal data.
