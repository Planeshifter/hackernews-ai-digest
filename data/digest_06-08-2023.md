#### [Submission URL](https://www.instructables.com/Mechanical-Apple-Watch-From-Real-E-Waste-Apple-Wat/) | 503 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [153 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36249671)

What's almost as cool as an Apple Watch? An entirely mechanical Apple Watch, of course! That's what DIY enthusiast NanoRobotGeek has created, taking apart an old Apple Watch to make a completely mechanical, "dumb" version of the watch that could last for years. Form and function were important for the project, with NanoRobotGeek selecting a series one Apple Watch with stainless steel and sapphire glass for a quality build. The final product uses a Seiko movement as a base and features unique touches like a chamfered gear bridge and a silver Côtes De Genève rotor.

The submission on Hacker News is about a DIY enthusiast who took apart an old Apple Watch and created a completely mechanical, "dumb" version of it, using a Seiko movement as a base. While some commenters praised the intricate design of mechanical watches and their long lifespan, others pointed out the potential drawbacks, such as the high cost of servicing and the need for regular winding. Some also discussed the pricing of Casio watches and the different types of watch services available. One commenter suggested reaching out to a watchmaker for proper servicing, while others shared their own experiences with mechanical watches. Overall, the discussion highlighted different perspectives on the merits and drawbacks of mechanical watches compared to their electronic counterparts.

### Understanding GPT tokenizers

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Jun/8/gpt-tokenizers/) | 388 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [113 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36248633)

Simon Willison, the co-creator of Django and a technology consultant, has built a tool that extracts tokens from text to search through a table of full tokens. Using OpenAI's Tokenizer tool for exploring tokens, Willison created a more interesting tool on Observable notebook. The notebook converts text to tokens, tokens to text, and allows users to run searches against the full token table. Willison also discusses glitch tokens and a Python library called tiktoken, which counts the number of tokens in a string before passing it to the API to ensure that the token limit is not exceeded.

The discussion delves into the details of tokenization and how it works in different programming languages. Some users also suggest using a Rust backend for optimization and compatibility with the OpenAI GPT-4 language model. Another interesting point raised is the concept of glitch tokens and how they can be used to improve training data for language models. Additionally, a Computerphile video on glitch tokens is shared as a useful introduction to the topic.

### iOS 17 automatically removes tracking parameters from links you click on

#### [Submission URL](https://9to5mac.com/2023/06/08/ios-17-link-tracking-protection/) | 833 points | by [belfalas](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belfalas) | [305 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36243955)

Apple has added a new privacy feature in iOS 17 that will remove tracking parameters from links that users click on. This feature, called Link Tracking Protection, will be automatically activated in Mail, Messages, and Safari in Private Browsing mode. By removing third-party cookies and tracking identifiers that advertisers and analytics firms add to link URLs, Apple is aiming to improve user privacy while browsing the web. To measure ad campaign conversion metrics, an alternative way for advertisers has been enabled, called Private Click Measurement ad attribution in Safari Private Browsing mode. The comments section addresses various discussions recognizing that this feature consolidates tracking power within Apple, how Mozilla and Google implemented similar standards in the past, and the limitations of existing plug-in support for Safari.

### Wolfram Prompt Repository

Wolfram has released a new repository featuring 51 prompts for its AI-powered chatbots, defining how they interact with users based on personas such as Birdnardo, PirateSpeak, and TechSupportBot. Other prompts in the repository cover functions such as TitleSuggest, Emojify, and CoverLetterSuggest, with over 100 options in total. Users can modify the output coming from the LLM with Modifiers such as LimerickStyled, EmojiTranslated and BadGrammar. The repository is aimed at writers and developers looking to create personalized, AI-powered conversation experiences.

### YouTube legal team contacted Invidious developers

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/3872) | 80 points | by [SushiHippie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SushiHippie) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36250582)

The legal team of YouTube has contacted the developers of Invidious, a privacy-focused and ad-free front-end for YouTube. The Invidious team believes that they never agreed to YouTube's terms of service (TOS) and that they do not use the YouTube API. However, they are prepared for the worst and have asked users to assume that YouTube will ask GitHub to take down the Invidious repositories. They have also promised to donate any funds remaining to FOSS/privacy organizations if they are forced to quit. Some users feel that YouTube is trying to force users onto its platform by blocking alternative clients like Invidious and others.

Some users of Invidious complain about the increasing cost of subscriptions on YouTube, and how they use the Invidious platform to watch videos without ads. There are suggestions to use ad-blockers like UBlock Origin or Sponsorblock to skip ads, or to switch to alternative platforms such as FreeTube or Piped. Others comment on the legal implications and how YouTube's legal team might be checking the ToS policies, API, and sending notices to organizations that they deem are violating their platform rules. There are also discussions about changes to Twitter and Reddit APIs.

### Weave: Interactive Data Exploration Toolkit by Weights and Biases

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/wandb/weave) | 48 points | by [sicariusnoctis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sicariusnoctis) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36237307)

Weights and Biases has open-sourced Weave, an interactive data exploration toolkit built to handle large datasets smoothly. Using Weave, Machine Learning practitioners can engage with their data and derive insights using interactive and beautiful plots, without the need to learn complicated APIs. Weave is also modular so users can combine different components to customize their own data exploration toolkit, and publish reusable components into the ecosystem for others to use. Weave is newly open sourced and the APIs are subject to change, but example notebooks demonstrating common usage patterns are available in their repository for interested parties to try.

### FFmpeg Adds Support for Animated JPEG-XL

#### [Submission URL](https://www.phoronix.com/news/FFmpeg-Animated-JPEG-XL) | 51 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36243889)

FFmpeg, the popular multimedia framework used by many application developers, can now decode animated JPEG-XL files, thanks to the addition of support for animated decode of JPEG-XL in the libjxl library through a new animated JPEG-XL demuxer. This comes after Apple announced their support for the royalty-free image codec in Safari, putting pressure on Google to reverse their decision to drop JPEG-XL support from Chrome last year. With increased adoption of this format, developers may find the addition useful for supporting animated JPEG-XL content.

One user mentions that JPEG-XL is a named replacement for GIFs, while another user points out that Motion JPEG is a compressed standard for video compression, unlike the lossless image compression format named GIF. Some users compare JPEG-XL to other formats like HEIF, WebP, and MNG, discussing their suitability for different purposes. One user also discusses the technical aspects of the format, mentioning progressive loading, inter-frame compression, and marginal lossless features.
