Simon Willison, the co-creator of Django and a technology consultant, has built a tool that extracts tokens from text to search through a table of full tokens. Using OpenAI's Tokenizer tool for exploring tokens, Willison created a more interesting tool on Observable notebook. The notebook converts text to tokens, tokens to text, and allows users to run searches against the full token table. Willison also discusses glitch tokens and a Python library called tiktoken, which counts the number of tokens in a string before passing it to the API to ensure that the token limit is not exceeded.

Simon Willison has created a tool that extracts tokens from text and searches through a table of full tokens. The tool uses OpenAI's Tokenizer to explore tokens and allows users to convert text to tokens and vice versa, as well as run searches against a full token table. The discussion delves into the details of tokenization and how it works in different programming languages. Some users also suggest using a Rust backend for optimization and compatibility with the OpenAI GPT-4 language model. Another interesting point raised is the concept of glitch tokens and how they can be used to improve training data for language models. Additionally, a Computerphile video on glitch tokens is shared as a useful introduction to the topic.

### The TI (Lisp) Explorer Project

#### [Submission URL](https://shanen.medium.com/the-ti-lisp-explorer-project-5fc53a90fb11) | 69 points | by [mepian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mepian) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36249546)

Shannon Jacobs, a programmer with experience in Lisp, worked on the TI Explorer Project in the 80s, which was perhaps the last native Lisp machine built. The Explorer Project ran Lisp out of microcode and there were not many machines available at that time. Jacobs joined the project a few months in and worked on the new machine until its release. He has many memories of those days, especially fixing hairy code for the main email system and chasing weird bugs. The machine used a lot of memory, but there wasn't much physical memory then, so a giant RAM card made a huge difference. Most of the development team was in Austin, but the key leaders were in Dallas, which meant a lot of work was dependent on the network. Ultimately, the entire TI computer division was sold off to HP soon after Jacobs left.

The discussion has focused on the technical aspects of the TI Explorer, including the Common Lisp garbage collector, memory mapping, and the proprietary NuBus system. Some commenters have shared memories of working with Lisp, while others have pointed out similarities with other Lisp-based systems from the era. One comment links to an eBay listing for a NuMachine board, while others describe the differences between NuBus and VME bus. Additionally, there is a separate thread discussing TI PC Scheme and other Lisp-related programming languages.

### AI browser extensions are a security nightmare

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kolide.com/blog/ai-browser-extensions-are-a-security-nightmare) | 248 points | by [terracatta](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=terracatta) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36243951)

a eerily accurate prediction based on the data it gleaned from your report. This scenario might sound far-fetched, but it’s not outside the realm of possibility. As we mentioned earlier, many of these extensions are experimental and have no clear policies around data sharing. Companies that don’t restrict use of these extensions could be putting valuable data at risk.

Extensions that are designed to analyze data can create wider security vulnerabilities. Say you’re working on a project related to sensitive financial data and decide to use an AI-powered browser extension to help you find trends in the data more quickly. If that extension is breached, it could expose not only your data, but also your coworkers’. In other words, the extension would have created a vulnerability in your company’s security posture.

Finally, there’s the potential for oversharing sensitive data with third parties. If you’re using an extension that accesses your email or other data on behalf of another company, it’s important to ask yourself why that company needs the data and how they’re using it. Does the extension really need access to your entire contact list? Does it really need to scan all of your emails? Think carefully before allowing an extension to access your data.

Assessing the Value of AI Browser Extensions

Clearly, there are significant risks associated with using AI browser extensions. But as with any new tool, there’s also the potential for great value. How can companies determine the value of a given extension while also minimizing potential security risks?

First, companies should assess whether current policies for restricting the use of browser extensions are sufficient or need to be updated. If there’s no clear policy in place, it’s time to create one. The policy should outline what types of extensions are allowed and under what circumstances they can be used.

Second, companies should work with their IT security teams to determine which extensions are allowed and which ones are prohibited. This can vary widely depending on the industry and the specific needs of the company.

Finally, employees should be trained on how to assess the security risks associated with a given extension. This might include researching the extension’s privacy policy, looking for reviews or news stories that discuss potential risks associated with the extension, and asking colleagues and IT security professionals for guidance.

Overall, it’s clear that companies need to be more proactive about assessing the security risks associated with AI browser extensions. By taking a thoughtful, proactive approach to extension use, however, it’s possible to minimize risks while also unlocking their full potential.

The article discusses the risks associated with using Artificial Intelligence(AI) browser extensions, including the potential for oversharing sensitive data with third parties, creating wider security vulnerabilities, and significant security risks when companies fail to restrict the use of such extensions. In the comments, some users discussed the need for better security policies and training employees on how to assess the security risks associated with a given extension. Others noted the risks created by granting broad and unclear permissions to browser extensions, and the need for more control over the requests for permission made by such extensions. Additionally, one user noted that mobile devices tend to give users less control over how extensions interact with the device.

### Desmos uses Pratt Parsers (2018)

#### [Submission URL](https://engineering.desmos.com/articles/pratt-parser/) | 97 points | by [vector_spaces](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vector_spaces) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36245786)

Desmos, a popular online graphing calculator, uses Pratt Parsing to create an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for expressions entered by users. Parsing is the process of converting a string of characters into an AST, which is then used to compute the value of the expression. The article offers a clear and concise explanation of how Pratt Parsing works, providing pseudocode and an example implementation in TypeScript. The article also discusses the concept of binding power, which determines the order of evaluation for operations with different levels of precedence. The Ast is used to be able to correctly evaluate expressions that have varying levels of precedence.

The submission discusses the use of Pratt parsing to build an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for expressions in Desmos, a popular online graphing calculator. The comments discuss the development of online graphing calculators and other software tools used in math education, including comparisons to similar tools like GeoGebra and FooPlot. The discussion also covers the technical details of parsing algorithms, including the Shunting Yard algorithm, and the life and work of computer scientist Vaughan Pratt. One user also mentions developing their own expression parser using different parsing algorithms.

### YouTube legal team contacted Invidious developers

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/iv-org/invidious/issues/3872) | 80 points | by [SushiHippie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SushiHippie) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36250582)

The legal team of YouTube has contacted the developers of Invidious, a privacy-focused and ad-free front-end for YouTube. The Invidious team believes that they never agreed to YouTube's terms of service (TOS) and that they do not use the YouTube API. However, they are prepared for the worst and have asked users to assume that YouTube will ask GitHub to take down the Invidious repositories. They have also promised to donate any funds remaining to FOSS/privacy organizations if they are forced to quit. Some users feel that YouTube is trying to force users onto its platform by blocking alternative clients like Invidious and others.

This discussion revolves around the recent actions taken by YouTube's legal team regarding the privacy-focused and ad-free front-end called Invidious. Some users of Invidious complain about the increasing cost of subscriptions on YouTube, and how they use the Invidious platform to watch videos without ads. There are suggestions to use ad-blockers like UBlock Origin or Sponsorblock to skip ads, or to switch to alternative platforms such as FreeTube or Piped. Others comment on the legal implications and how YouTube's legal team might be checking the ToS policies, API, and sending notices to organizations that they deem are violating their platform rules. There are also discussions about changes to Twitter and Reddit APIs.

### Weave: Interactive Data Exploration Toolkit by Weights and Biases

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/wandb/weave) | 48 points | by [sicariusnoctis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sicariusnoctis) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36237307)

Weights and Biases has open-sourced Weave, an interactive data exploration toolkit built to handle large datasets smoothly. Using Weave, Machine Learning practitioners can engage with their data and derive insights using interactive and beautiful plots, without the need to learn complicated APIs. Weave is also modular so users can combine different components to customize their own data exploration toolkit, and publish reusable components into the ecosystem for others to use. Weave is newly open sourced and the APIs are subject to change, but example notebooks demonstrating common usage patterns are available in their repository for interested parties to try.

The founder and CTO of Weights and Biases, Shawn, explains that Weave is a UI toolkit for programmers that enables them to explore large datasets through interactive and beautiful plots without the need to learn complicated APIs. Weave is modular, which means that users can combine different components to customize their data exploration toolkit. Additionally, Weave is open source and has APIs subject to change. The conversation then shifts to replacing Weave with Pandas. Shawn explains that while Weave is capable of visual data transformation, it is not meant to replace Pandas, which is an incredibly powerful tool for data science. Weave leverages Arrow and WeaveList and has advantages in representing arbitrarily nested data structures, while Pandas can handle structured data more efficiently. One user expresses their ambition to transform visual data, in which Weave can provide a benefit, but acknowledges the incredible feat that Pandas has accomplished in data science.

### FFmpeg Adds Support for Animated JPEG-XL

#### [Submission URL](https://www.phoronix.com/news/FFmpeg-Animated-JPEG-XL) | 51 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36243889)

FFmpeg, the popular multimedia framework used by many application developers, can now decode animated JPEG-XL files, thanks to the addition of support for animated decode of JPEG-XL in the libjxl library through a new animated JPEG-XL demuxer. This comes after Apple announced their support for the royalty-free image codec in Safari, putting pressure on Google to reverse their decision to drop JPEG-XL support from Chrome last year. With increased adoption of this format, developers may find the addition useful for supporting animated JPEG-XL content.

The comments on the submission mainly discuss the history of JPEG-XL, its advantages over other formats, and the features of FFMPEG. One user mentions that JPEG-XL is a named replacement for GIFs, while another user points out that Motion JPEG is a compressed standard for video compression, unlike the lossless image compression format named GIF. Some users compare JPEG-XL to other formats like HEIF, WebP, and MNG, discussing their suitability for different purposes. One user also discusses the technical aspects of the format, mentioning progressive loading, inter-frame compression, and marginal lossless features.
