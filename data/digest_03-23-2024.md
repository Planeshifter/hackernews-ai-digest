#### [Submission URL](https://seriot.ch/projects/pschess.html) | 84 points | by [beefburger](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beefburger) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39803606)

Today on Hacker News, a fascinating project by seriot.ch has caught the attention of the community. The project, named PSChess, is a Chess Engine implemented entirely in PostScript. The motivation behind this project was to explore the possibilities of executing code on a printer and to test if one could play chess against a printer. The project is divided into five steps, with the first four already completed successfully. Users can interact with PSChess using GhostScript with specific arguments and make moves by entering commands like d2d4. The game state is maintained in a dictionary, and pieces are moved using PostScript instructions. The structure of the PSChess code is organized into three main files handling the board data structure, chess rules, evaluation functions, and the drawing of the chessboard and game state. Visual tests and unit tests are also included to ensure the correctness of the implementation.

An interesting aspect of the project is the evaluation function, which assigns values to each piece and calculates a positional value based on its location on the board. The implementation includes a min-max algorithm to determine the computer's moves during gameplay. Overall, PSChess presents a unique and innovative approach to chess engine development, demonstrating the versatility and capabilities of PostScript beyond traditional printing tasks.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about the PSChess project includes various users sharing their insights and experiences with PostScript programming.
