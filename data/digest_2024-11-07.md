### Evaluating the world model implicit in a generative model

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03689) | 150 points | by [dsubburam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dsubburam) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42073801)

A recent paper titled "Evaluating the World Model Implicit in a Generative Model" by Keyon Vafa and colleagues delves into the intriguing potential of large language models to learn and represent underlying world models. The authors propose a structured approach to assess this capability, particularly when operating within the confines of a deterministic finite automaton. Their findings apply across various fields including logical reasoning, geography, game strategies, and chemistry.

The research introduces novel evaluation metrics drawn from the Myhill-Nerode theorem, aimed at uncovering the coherence of the world models synthesized by generative models. While initial diagnostics suggest competence, the new metrics unveil significant incoherence in these models, highlighting a fragility that could hinder their performance on subtly altered tasks. This underscores the necessity for better generative models that accurately reflect the complexities of their respective domains. The implications of this study could pave the way for advancements in AI that more effectively grasp and replicate the logical structures of the tasks at hand.

The discussion surrounding the paper on evaluating the world models in large language models (LLMs) touches on several critical points about their capabilities and limitations. 

1. **Internal Model Representation**: Commenters debate the nature of internal models created by LLMs, with some arguing that LLMs inherently utilize external world models rather than building coherent internal representations. The notion that LLMs may function as mere regressors focused on word predictions is brought up, suggesting a possible mismatch between learning processes and true world modeling.
2. **Model Coherence and Fragility**: The introduction of new evaluation metrics has led to concerns about the coherence of synthesized world models. Several commenters express skepticism about LLMs' ability to generalize well across slightly altered tasks, potentially hinting at a fragility in their predictions due to the lack of deep logical understanding or representation of domain-specific complexities.
3. **Generative Processes**: There is a recurring discussion on the distinction between generative processes in models and the deterministic nature of finite automata. Some comments advocate that true generative modeling requires richer sensory inputs and the capacity to understand dynamic environments rather than just regressing toward word predictions.
4. **Implications of Kant’s Philosophy**: A few comments reference Kantian philosophy and its relevance to current discussions on how LLMs perceive and represent the world, leading to speculation that these models may lack fundamental concepts like causality that are crucial for robust reasoning and interaction with the physical world.
5. **Future Directions**: Contributors express optimism for future developments, especially in robotics and virtual environments, where LLMs might drive breakthroughs in understanding complex interactions and environments.

Overall, the conversation reveals a nuanced understanding of the challenges and potential advancements in the realm of AI, focusing on the philosophical, theoretical, and practical implications of large language models' capabilities and their interactions with world modeling.
