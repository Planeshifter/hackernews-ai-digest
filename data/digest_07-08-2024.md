### Three Algorithms in a Room

#### [Submission URL](https://prospect.org/economy/2024-06-05-three-algorithms-in-a-room/) | 32 points | by [bryanrasmussen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bryanrasmussen) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40904407)

In the June 2024 issue of The American Prospect magazine, an in-depth investigation uncovers the roots of modern economic challenges stemming from the airline industry. Following the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978, airlines found a way to circumvent traditional price-fixing regulations by establishing a third-party entity, the Airline Tariff Publishing Company (ATPCO), to share confidential pricing information among competitors.

Although ATPCO claimed not to set fares, the Department of Justice (DOJ) raised concerns about how this system allowed airlines to synchronize price hikes, akin to illegal collusion. Surprisingly, the DOJ settled with ATPCO rather than pursuing a trial, setting a precedent for weak antitrust enforcement. This leniency paved the way for a surge in algorithmic price-fixing practices across various industries, using advanced technologies to coordinate pricing strategies and maximize profits. 

Amid mounting scrutiny, both the DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are now actively pursuing legal action against such algorithmic schemes, aiming to rectify past oversights and ensure that new methods of price-fixing do not go unchecked. This marks a significant shift in antitrust regulation and highlights the ongoing battle to rein in anti-competitive practices in the digital age.

- User "n4r9" points out that the issue with algorithmically pricing things is that inherently algorithms tend to problematize the idea of market players colluding. They reference Matt Stoller's blog post series focusing on anti-trust issues and share links to related articles.
- User "tsdrwmllr" mentions that airfares have risen despite the settlement according to a study cited by the St. Louis Federal Reserve about ATPCO. They suggest checking the links provided for more information on the inflation-adjusted fares falling.
- User "glblnd" discusses a hypothetical scenario where if a similar situation were to occur in the petroleum industry, the outcome would be a sharp increase in fuel prices as a response to market forces being manipulated by flight algorithms.
- User "chsthry" adds a comment regarding the extreme price fluctuations that are expected when companies like Near attempt to fly over the North Pole, possibly in connection to the previous discussions about algorithmic pricing. 
- "n4r9" adds another comment about the consequences of shareholder capitalism, presumably related to the overarching theme of market manipulation and anti-competitive practices.
