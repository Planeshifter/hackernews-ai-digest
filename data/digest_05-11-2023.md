#### [Submission URL](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/how-an-ibm-computer-learned-to-sing) | 41 points | by [isomorph](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=isomorph) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35906783)

Back in 1961, a team at Bell Labs had the bright idea of teaching the IBM 7094 computer how to sing. Using breakthrough speech synthesis technology, they taught the computer to work through the melody of "Daisy Bell," also known as "Bicycle Built for Two." The result sounded creepy but surprisingly futuristic, with the vocal part sounding a little bit like today's Auto-Tuned pop songs. The whole experiment seemed a little edgy and transgressive for its time, considering the lyrics were essentially a marriage proposal and the song envisioned a happy-ever-after embedded in a new technology. This project anticipated the future of music and, in a way, even the current-day investments in robots designed to provide relationships.

In the world of computer science, P vs NP is often discussed as the difficulty level of problems, with P being easy and NP being hard. However, problems can get way harder than NP, such as PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME-complete, 2-EXPTIME-complete, ELEMENTARY-complete, TOWER-complete, and Ackermann-complete. These types of problems have varying levels of difficulty, with Ackermann-complete being the most difficult due to its use of the Ackermann function. Despite their complexity, these types of problems have interesting applications in areas such as game theory, logic, and program synthesis.

This submission discusses the different levels of computational complexity beyond NP, including PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME-complete, 2-EXPTIME-complete, ELEMENTARY-complete, TOWER-complete, and Ackermann-complete, highlighting their applications in areas such as game theory, logic, and program synthesis. In the comments, users discuss Linear Temporal Logic and its interesting properties, as well as regular expressions and their matching capabilities. Other discussion points include the practical solvability of EXPTIME-complete problems in machine learning, the difficulty of solving puzzles (such as Sudoku) of varying sizes, and the increasing difficulty of un-decidable problems beyond NP.

### ICANN Board Approves RDAP Amendments (To Replace WHOIS)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.icann.org/en/blogs/details/icann-board-approves-rdap-amendments-04-05-2023-en) | 21 points | by [pabs3](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pabs3) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35897827)

ICANN has approved amendments to the Registration Data Access Protocol (RDAP), which will lead to the phasing out of the WHOIS protocol for registration data directory services. RDAP is seen as more secure and user-friendly, providing standardised queries, secure data access, differentiated access, and support for internationalisation of registration data. The new protocol also offers scalability, with the ability to accommodate new functionality requirements driven by future policy changes. The decision marks an important milestone in ICANN's commitment to improving the underlying technology for registration data services for the internet community.

The comment thread is discussing the implications of the decision to phase out WHOIS protocol and transition to RDAP. One commenter notes that registrars are mandatorily required to support RDAP, which means that supporting WHOIS will become subject to additional monitoring requirements. The commenter adds that ICANN is not planning to simply drop WHOIS, but it may be dropped in the future. Another commenter hopes that the change won't affect privacy. A third commenter notes that the changes are technical and relate to delivering registration data by switching from an ASCII-only protocol to a machine-readable JSON-based protocol that is Unicode-ready. There is also mention of unwritten standards for WHOIS protocol that are widely applicable, specifically in relation to ccTLDs and IP addresses. Another commenter suggests that making WHOIS data machine-readable will be useful for allowing better support information.

### Proposal: Less error-prone loop variable scoping

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/60078) | 82 points | by [yujian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yujian) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35909595)

The Go team is proposing a change to the way for loop variables declared with := are handled in order to make them less error-prone. The proposal suggests changing from one-instance-per-loop to one-instance-per-iteration, which would prevent unintended sharing in closures and goroutines, fixing many subtly broken for loops in new and updated code. However, to avoid breaking existing code, this change would only apply to packages in modules that explicitly declare a new enough Go version in the go.mod file. The proposal outlines tooling support that would help with the transition and debugging, and preliminary analysis suggests that changing the semantics is usually a no-op, and when it’s not, it fixes buggy code far more often than it breaks correct code.

The discussion includes comments about various programming languages and their complexities, safety, and system-wide problems. Some assert that successful programming languages have a strong balance in practical software engineering and language safety constraints. Others argue that the success of a programming language is mainly due to its community of developers and managers. There is also discussion about multiple return types and the benefits and drawbacks of returning structured results.

### Delimiters won’t save you from prompt injection

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/11/delimiters-wont-save-you/) | 12 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35904361)

Simon Willison's latest blog post discusses the ongoing problem of prompt injection and the proposed solution of using delimiters to mark the start and end of untrusted user input. However, Willison demonstrates that this solution is easily defeated and highlights the difficulty of finding a solution to prompt injection due to the nature of large language models and the sequence of tokens it generates. Willison also critiques the limited coverage of prompt injection in the new interactive video course ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, which is presented by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng in partnership with OpenAI. This post provides insight into the ongoing challenges of prompt engineering and the need for continued innovation to solve this complex issue.

The discussion revolves around the topic of prompt injection and Simon Willison's blog post on the issue. One user suggests that a system-level API could prevent the problem, but another user points out that a recent information system behaved unexpectedly and did not handle input properly. Simon Willison's solution of using delimiters to mark the start and end of untrusted user input is criticized as easily defeated, and one user suggests using randomized delimiters. However, another user points out that this solution is not foolproof as symbols can still be injected, but the attacker would need to connect them in a non-logical manner. Another user notes that the article did not mention injections without delimiters.

### DeepMind cofounder warns govts must find solutions for jobs lost to A.I

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2023/05/10/artificial-intelligence-deepmind-co-founder-mustafa-suleyman-ubi-governments-seriously-need-to-find-solution-for-people-that-lose-their-jobs/) | 43 points | by [goplayoutside](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goplayoutside) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35905604)

Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, has suggested that governments should consider universal basic income (UBI) for the knowledge sector workers whose jobs could be threatened by automation. Speaking at the GIC Bridge Forum event in San Francisco, Suleyman argued that policymakers needed to provide "material compensation" for those affected. This follows claims by Goldman Sachs that generative AI could put 300 million full-time US and European workers out of a job. Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak have both called for a delay in advanced AI research.


The co-founder of DeepMind, Mustafa Suleyman, has suggested governments consider implementing a universal basic income (UBI) for knowledge sector workers, whose jobs could be threatened by automation. Some commenters argue that the government should require companies that utilise AI to compensate the people whose jobs the technology replaces. Other commenters feel implementing UBI could cause economic issues, such as inflation and creating a culture of dependency. Some people also suggest that UBI is not a solution to job loss caused by automation and that focusing on creating jobs instead of just replacing income is a more effective approach. The discussion also touches on topics such as economics, politics, industrial mechanisms, and the educational system.
