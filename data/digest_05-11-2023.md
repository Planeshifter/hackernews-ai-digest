### An IBM computer learned to sing in 1961

#### [Submission URL](https://tedgioia.substack.com/p/how-an-ibm-computer-learned-to-sing) | 41 points | by [isomorph](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=isomorph) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35906783)

Back in 1961, a team at Bell Labs had the bright idea of teaching the IBM 7094 computer how to sing. Using breakthrough speech synthesis technology, they taught the computer to work through the melody of "Daisy Bell," also known as "Bicycle Built for Two." The result sounded creepy but surprisingly futuristic, with the vocal part sounding a little bit like today's Auto-Tuned pop songs. The whole experiment seemed a little edgy and transgressive for its time, considering the lyrics were essentially a marriage proposal and the song envisioned a happy-ever-after embedded in a new technology. This project anticipated the future of music and, in a way, even the current-day investments in robots designed to provide relationships.

Commenters discussed the technical details of the synthesis and pointed to various sources for further reading. Some mentioned other projects that involve physical models of sound synthesis and singing, such as Hui-Ling Lu's dissertation on singing synthesis and the Pink Trombone project. Others noted the historical significance of the project and how it reminds them of different games and movies that reference "Daisy Bell."

### Problems harder than NP-Complete

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.email/hillelwayne/archive/problems-harder-than-np-complete/) | 239 points | by [azhenley](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=azhenley) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35908477)

In the world of computer science, P vs NP is often discussed as the difficulty level of problems, with P being easy and NP being hard. However, problems can get way harder than NP, such as PSPACE-complete, EXPTIME-complete, 2-EXPTIME-complete, ELEMENTARY-complete, TOWER-complete, and Ackermann-complete. These types of problems have varying levels of difficulty, with Ackermann-complete being the most difficult due to its use of the Ackermann function. Despite their complexity, these types of problems have interesting applications in areas such as game theory, logic, and program synthesis.

In the comments, users discuss Linear Temporal Logic and its interesting properties, as well as regular expressions and their matching capabilities. Other discussion points include the practical solvability of EXPTIME-complete problems in machine learning, the difficulty of solving puzzles (such as Sudoku) of varying sizes, and the increasing difficulty of un-decidable problems beyond NP.

Stability AI, the open-source AI firm, has introduced the Stable Animation SDK, which offers artists and developers the ability to use the most advanced Stable Diffusion models to create stunning animations. The tool allows users to create animations using text prompts, source images or videos, with the option to tweak various parameters to produce the desired results. Stable Animation SDK includes all Stable Diffusion models, including the Stable Diffusion 2.0 and Stable Diffusion XL and offers three ways to create animations. Interested parties can join the developer platform and the animation artist community on Discord to know more.

### A transformer-based method for zero and few-shot biomedical NER

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04928) | 72 points | by [nikolamilosevic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nikolamilosevic) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35901538)

A transformer-based method for zero and few-shot biomedical named entity recognition has been proposed to address the challenges of supervised named entity recognition (NER) in the biomedical domain. The method transforms the task of multi-class token classification into binary token classification and pre-trains on a larger amount of datasets and biomedical entities, enabling the method to learn semantic relations. The proposed method achieves impressive results with average F1 scores of 35.44% for zero-shot NER, 50.10% for one-shot NER, 69.94% for 10-shot NER, and 79.51% for 100-shot NER on 9 diverse evaluated biomedical entities with PubMedBERT fine-tuned model.

There is a discussion around the benefits and drawbacks of different methods for named entity recognition, including regular expressions, CRFs, simple LSTMs, and more advanced systems modeled after BERT. Finally, some commenters share relevant resources and packages for named entity recognition, while others explain what named entity recognition refers to.

### Chat-UI, the codebase of HuggingChat, is open sourced

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/huggingface/chat-ui) | 131 points | by [osanseviero](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=osanseviero) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35907564)

This is the GitHub repository for the Chat UI, an open-source codebase powering the HuggingChat app on huggingface.co/chat. The Chat UI is a SvelteKit app that utilizes open-source models such as OpenAssistant. The repository contains instructions for launching the app, running local inference, and building a production version of the app. The Chat UI has 831 stars and 45 forks on GitHub.

The comments reveal a range of discussions on topics such as the ChatGPT and its user interface, the structure of memory chats, and features that could be added to Chat UI. The discussion also highlights interesting UIs for the ChatGPT and mentions the availability of plugins. There is also a mention of FerretDB, a progress made on a source material database implementation. Finally, the comments touch on the lack of legal filenames and the use of SvelteKit.

### Delimiters wonâ€™t save you from prompt injection

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/11/delimiters-wont-save-you/) | 12 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35904361)

Simon Willison's latest blog post discusses the ongoing problem of prompt injection and the proposed solution of using delimiters to mark the start and end of untrusted user input. However, Willison demonstrates that this solution is easily defeated and highlights the difficulty of finding a solution to prompt injection due to the nature of large language models and the sequence of tokens it generates. Willison also critiques the limited coverage of prompt injection in the new interactive video course ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, which is presented by Isa Fulford and Andrew Ng in partnership with OpenAI. This post provides insight into the ongoing challenges of prompt engineering and the need for continued innovation to solve this complex issue.

One user suggests that a system-level API could prevent the problem, but another user points out that a recent information system behaved unexpectedly and did not handle input proper. One user suggests using randomized delimiters. However, another user points out that this solution is not foolproof as symbols can still be injected, but the attacker would need to connect them in a non-logical manner. Another user notes that the article did not mention injections without delimiters.

### DeepMind cofounder warns govts must find solutions for jobs lost to A.I

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2023/05/10/artificial-intelligence-deepmind-co-founder-mustafa-suleyman-ubi-governments-seriously-need-to-find-solution-for-people-that-lose-their-jobs/) | 43 points | by [goplayoutside](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goplayoutside) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35905604)

Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, has suggested that governments should consider universal basic income (UBI) for the knowledge sector workers whose jobs could be threatened by automation. Speaking at the GIC Bridge Forum event in San Francisco, Suleyman argued that policymakers needed to provide "material compensation" for those affected. This follows claims by Goldman Sachs that generative AI could put 300 million full-time US and European workers out of a job. Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak have both called for a delay in advanced AI research.

Some commenters argue that the government should require companies that utilise AI to compensate the people whose jobs the technology replaces. Other commenters feel implementing UBI could cause economic issues, such as inflation and creating a culture of dependency. Some people also suggest that UBI is not a solution to job loss caused by automation and that focusing on creating jobs instead of just replacing income is a more effective approach. The discussion also touches on topics such as economics, politics, industrial mechanisms, and the educational system.
