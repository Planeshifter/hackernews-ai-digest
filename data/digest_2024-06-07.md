In a fascinating exploration of how GPT-4o encodes images, Oran Looney delves into the intriguing world of token costs and magic numbers. The enigmatic choice of 170 tokens per 512x512 image tile raises questions about the underlying representation of images within the transformer model. The article unpacks the transition from image pixels to embedding vectors, shedding light on the complexity of converting visual data into a format suitable for the transformer model. By considering factors like the number of dimensions used internally and the spatial organization of image tokens, Looney offers insights into potential strategies employed by GPT-4o in handling image data.

From deciphering the significance of 170 tokens to speculating on the embedding approach for images, the piece navigates the intersection of machine learning and visual processing with a blend of analysis and speculation. The quest to unravel the mysteries of image encoding in GPT-4o presents a captivating journey through the intricate mechanisms of AI technology.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about GPT-4o's image encoding ranges from comparisons with other OCR models to the implications of LLM (large language models) in AI development. Issues such as the intricacies of OCR models like PaddleOCR, the potential of VLM-1 for text parsing, and the limitations of OCR technology are highlighted. Additionally, there are discussions about OCR tools like PaddleOCR lacking comprehensive documentation, the challenges of handling document images effectively, and the potential application of VQVAE in image reconstruction. The conversation touches on topics like text extraction, model complexity, and the need for clear documentation in AI tools. Participants bring up various insights, suggestions, and points of view on AI technologies, OCR models, and image processing techniques.

### Microsoft will switch off Recall by default after security backlash

Microsoft’s new Windows feature named Recall was intended to provide AI-enabled memory for devices, but it quickly faced criticism for its potential security and privacy risks. Recall, which silently stores screenshots of user activity every five seconds, was seen as preinstalled spyware that could expose sensitive information to hackers.  In response to mounting criticism, Microsoft announced significant changes to the Recall feature rollout. It will now be an opt-in feature in specific versions of Windows, with enhanced security measures such as data encryption and authentication requirements. These changes aim to address concerns raised by cybersecurity experts about the potential vulnerabilities of Recall-enabled devices.

Despite these improvements, some experts remain cautious about the risks associated with Recall. There are concerns about unresolved privacy issues, such as legal implications for users compelled to disclose their historical data. The rollback of the Recall feature reflects Microsoft’s ongoing struggle with cybersecurity incidents and breaches, leading the company to prioritize security in all business decisions. This incident highlights the challenges tech companies face in balancing innovation with security and privacy concerns. Microsoft’s Recall feature rollout serves as a cautionary tale of the importance of addressing cybersecurity issues proactively to maintain trust and user safety in the digital age.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding Microsoft facing backlash over the Recall feature rollout covers various aspects such as security, privacy, and the balance between innovation and user safety. 

Some users highlighted Microsoft's emphasis on security features and changes made to address cybersecurity concerns related to Recall. Others pointed out the importance of security and trust in technology services provided by corporations. 

There were also discussions comparing Microsoft's Recall feature rollout with browsing history storage in browsers like Chrome, Safari, and Edge, emphasizing privacy concerns and encryption practices. Users noted the implications of privacy issues and the need for transparent privacy policies in tech companies. 

Additionally, the conversation delved into the perception of consumer data privacy, the exploitation of information by advertisers, and the need for clear privacy policies and regulations to protect user data. 

Overall, the discussion reflected a deeper examination of the implications of technology innovations on user privacy and the need for responsible data handling practices by companies.

### σ-GPTs: A new approach to autoregressive models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09562) | 276 points | by [mehulashah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mehulashah) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40608413)

The latest submission on Hacker News is a paper titled "σ-GPTs: A New Approach to Autoregressive Models" by Arnaud Pannatier and their colleagues. This paper challenges the traditional fixed order approach used in autoregressive models like the GPT family by introducing a method to modulate the generation order on-the-fly per sample. By adding positional encoding for output, this technique enables sampling and conditioning on specific token subsets, as well as dynamic sampling of multiple tokens at once based on a rejection strategy, resulting in a more efficient generation process across various domains. Check out the paper for more insights on this innovative approach in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The discussion on the submission "σ-GPTs: A New Approach to Autoregressive Models" covers various aspects of the paper. Some users discuss the nuances of the proposed methodology, including the random permutation of training data, positional encodings, rejection sampling for generating multiple tokens at once, and the conditional probability distributions for missing tokens. 

There are comparisons made with other models like PixelCNN and XLNet, as well as clarifications on the differences between autoregressive models and the use of rejection sampling in model training. The discussion also touches on the practical applications of rejection sampling in large-scale text generation models and how it impacts the generation process.

Additionally, there are mentions of tools like Zotero for organizing research papers, a Firefox extension for annotating web pages, and the idea of using diffusion-like mechanisms in language models. Users have also shared their thoughts on generating text using diffusion methods and the potential challenges with syntactic checking during text generation. 

Overall, the discussion showcases a diverse range of perspectives on the novel approach presented in the paper and its implications for the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.
