### Disney's newest robot demonstrates collaborative cuteness

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot-2666681104) | 39 points | by [kungfudoi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kungfudoi) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39339264)

Disney's newest robot, Duke Weaselton, is demonstrating the power of collaborative cuteness. At Walt Disney Imagineering, researchers have been exploring the idea of robots collaborating with each other, and Duke Weaselton is the result of one such collaboration. Duke, a furry character, interacts with a purple kiosk onstage, with both characters showcasing different kinds of motion. By working together as one system, they are able to achieve dynamic and expressive movements. This opens up exciting opportunities for entertainment robotics and demonstrates that two robots can be much more capable than one.

The discussion on this submission revolves around a few different topics. 
- One user mentions that Disney's YouTube channel regularly posts interesting developments in animation, human tracking, and motion. They provide a link to the channel and encourage checking it out.
- Another user asks about the high pixelated gif they see on a website, to which someone responds that it is likely a WebM file, an open media format designed for the web. There is then a discussion about whether iOS supports WebM, with one user mentioning that Safari on iOS does not support it.
- Someone else comments that the robot in question appears to be collaborating and wonders what it would be like if it spoke to technical experts at IEEE, the professional organization for technical advancements. There is a response mentioning that spectrum proceedings (presumably an IEEE publication) would be interested in this kind of development.
- A user points out that the discussion has deviated from the topic and that the robot is indeed a robot. This leads to a brief conversation about the definition of a robot.

Overall, the discussion touches on topics like Disney's other developments, media formats, technical organizations, and the nature of robots.

### Show HN: LLMWare – Small Specialized Function Calling 1B LLMs for Multi-Step RAG

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/llmware-ai/llmware) | 46 points | by [doberst0103](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doberst0103) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39335263)

llmware is a unified framework for developing LLM (Language and Learning Models) based application patterns, including Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). It provides a set of tools that make it easy to build knowledge-based enterprise applications using open source models and secure integration of enterprise knowledge. With llmware, developers can access and use a wide range of models through the Model Catalog, ingest, organize, and index a collection of knowledge with the Library feature, and query libraries with various filters using the Query feature. The framework is designed to be beginner-friendly while also catering to the needs of experienced AI developers.

The discussion around the submission mainly consists of comments from the project creator, blzngbnn. They provide some insights into the development of LLMWare, including the ability to run models locally on standard consumer CPUs and the provision of cheap and efficient model processing. They mention using SLIM models for powerful timing and internal business process enhancements using LLMs.
Another user, doberst0103, thanks blzngbnn for their feedback. Then trcrblltx reminds blzngbnn to give credit to llmcpp for running models and mentions the project's platform for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) function calling.
In response, doberst0103 acknowledges the credit that should be given to Georgi Gerganov and mentions their amazing advancements demonstrated in YouTube videos.
Finally, blzngbnn agrees that llmcpp, the open-source community, and getting AI models directly into the hands of people are all excellent things. They express excitement for the power of local LLMs and mention eagerly waiting for open-source platforms to fulfill their potential by 2024.

### Show HN: Loz – Automate Git Commit Messages with LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/joone/loz) | 18 points | by [cubix4u](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cubix4u) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39331538)

LOZ is a powerful command-line tool that harnesses the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) like code-lamma and GPT-3.5 to automatically generate GIT commit messages based on code changes. With 201 stars and 11 forks, this project is gaining traction in the developer community. The tool is written in TypeScript, JavaScript, Shell, and Dockerfile. The repository has 3 contributors, including the creator, Joone Hur. If you're looking for a way to streamline your commit workflow and make it more efficient, LOZ might be the tool you need.

The discussion on the LOZ tool revolves around the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating commit messages and the effectiveness of such messages. One commenter points out that the AI doesn't understand the business context of the code changes and cannot explain the higher-level reasoning behind them. They argue that the generated messages lack usefulness in providing helpful information for debugging or modifying code.

Another commenter argues that commit messages should describe the context and reasoning behind the code changes, making the generated messages essentially pointless.
Someone shares their experience with using a Python script to generate commit messages using ChatGPT 1 (powered by GPT) and suggests a similar approach to LOZ.
Lastly, a user mentions the effectiveness of GitHub Copilot in summarizing pull requests (PRs), working seamlessly within the GitHub workflow. They suggest experimenting with multiple models and comparing comments to determine what works best.
