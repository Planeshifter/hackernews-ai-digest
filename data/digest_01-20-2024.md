According to a study by the Automobile Association of America's Foundation for Traffic Safety, 16-21% of all fatal vehicle crashes reported to the police in the US involve drowsy driving. This means that between 6,080 and 7,980 road deaths are linked to drowsy drivers, surpassing the number of deaths caused by drunk driving. Automakers have been implementing drowsiness detection systems in vehicles for years, but advancements in semi-autonomous capabilities are now allowing cars to take control of the vehicle if the driver becomes inattentive or incapacitated. The systems can detect if the driver is no longer driving and trigger visual, audible, and physical prompts to wake them up. However, there is still room for improvement as these emergency stop capabilities are not foolproof.

Discussion:
- Kirby64 points out that while it's interesting that the discussion about emergency braking systems in standard cars happens to stop paying attention to autonomous cars, Mercedes calling a call center can be aggressive and does not send a journalist calling. Many users agree that the aggressive behavior of the call center is not ideal.
- pnkglm adds that for a person reacting to a sequence described as a medical emergency, it's good to check if there was a collision, as reporting a collision can save a life.
- m3047 mentions that they would prefer to be involved in a less life-threatening incident and questions the compliance of the person answering the emergency call.
- pnkglm agrees that implementing the call is an important thing to check as the emergency services should be able to respond quickly.
- dst-pch points out that people should start being shocked by reduced cognitive abilities and it makes sense to ask serious yet simple questions to determine what happened.
- RockRobotRock mentions that negligence is a relevant topic and automatic emergency braking systems are important in highway settings.
- smj notes that the headline cuts off and the article could be about emergency stopping sounds.
- dnldhntr finds it interesting how the behavior of the involving collision station is available and thinks it's important to know how people react to a collision station.
- marcellus23 suggests that automated emergency braking might mean the system breaks more thanks to your hot thoughts about the year, and that cars with cruise control and hands-off- wheel behavior are braking more in any case.
