In a thought-provoking new directive, the Church, through its Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith and the Dicastery for Culture and Education, has delved into the relationship between artificial intelligence (AI) and human intelligence. This "Note" is framed within the Christian tradition, emphasizing intelligence as a divine gift and exploring the critical role it plays in human existence and stewardship of creation.

As the Church underscores the importance of scientific and technological advancements, particularly AI, it calls for a reflection on the ethical and anthropological challenges posed by this rapidly evolving technology. AI's ability to mimic human intelligence and produce outputs that transcend human capabilities raises significant ethical questions about truth, responsibility, and the essence of being human.

The document highlights that AI signifies a pivotal shift in technological history, as described by Pope Francis as an "epochal change". It impacts numerous aspects of life including relationships, education, healthcare, and even warfare. This necessitates careful consideration to use AI for the common good and to promote human progress.

To participate positively in this global dialogue on AI, the Church outlines its reflections and guidelines. These draw from the philosophical and theological tradition, aimed not only at faith transmitters like parents and teachers but also at a global audience interested in guiding scientific progress towards human dignity and societal developments.

Ultimately, the Church urges that the deployment of AI should respect human dignity, emphasizing the need for ethical stewardship that nurtures rather than undermines our humanity.
