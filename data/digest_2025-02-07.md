#### [Submission URL](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) | 162 points | by [tehnub](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tehnub) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976698)

In the digital age, manual, repetitive tasks, or "slogs" as they’re coined, can sap the productivity of operations teams. Though some teams might dream of full automation, they often stall due to the perceived all-or-nothing nature of such projects. Enter the notion of "do-nothing scripting," a clever strategy to ease these mundane processes into the realm of automation bit by bit.

The concept of do-nothing scripting involves creating a script that maps out a cumbersome manual task, like provisioning user accounts, as discrete, manageable steps. Each step is encapsulated in a function—a simple script that prompts the user to perform each part of the task manually. While it doesn’t automate the process immediately, it creates an organized pathway toward eventual automation, ensuring no steps are misplaced or forgotten.

The real charm lies in its progressiveness: each step becomes a candidate for future automation. Over time, this incremental approach can build a robust library of automation scripts, minimizing toil gradually rather than in one monumental leap. The method transforms frustrating slogs into structured procedural flows, lowering the threshold for automation initiatives and making it easier for teams to focus their energies on more rewarding challenges.

Ultimately, do-nothing scripting shines as a strategic bridge between manual burden and automated efficiency, helping teams nudge their operating procedures from a time-consuming slog to an efficient sprint.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion on "do-nothing scripting" highlights its value as a low-effort gateway to automation, though with nuanced critiques and extensions. Key points include:  

1. **Incremental Adoption**: Commenters praised the approach for reducing the cognitive load of tackling manual processes. Scripting discrete steps (e.g., Jira workflows, SSH key provisioning) creates a clear roadmap for future automation while providing immediate documentation.  

2. **Tool Comparisons**: Some favored command-line scripts for transparency and repeatability over GUI tools. Others suggested Jupyter notebooks or Ansible playbooks as alternatives for structured workflows.  

3. **Critiques**: Criticisms centered on potential overhead (e.g., unnecessary scripts for tasks already solvable via tools like `github-keygen`) and security risks (e.g., blindly generating SSH keys via AI-generated scripts without human oversight).  

4. **Broader Insights**:  
   - **Documentation**: Scripts act as living checklists, aiding onboarding and process accountability.  
   - **GUIs as Bottlenecks**: Several users lamented the brittleness of automating GUI-driven tasks versus CLI-native workflows.  
   - **AI Integration**: An example of using ChatGPT to generate "do-nothing" steps raised debates about balancing automation speed with security best practices.  

5. **Related Work**: Links to prior discussions (3+ years old) show lasting interest in minimal automation strategies, alongside tools like Fabric and POSSE-inspired scripts.  

Ultimately, the method is seen as a pragmatic bridge from manual to automated work, though success hinges on avoiding over-engineering and prioritizing critical steps.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jeprinz/pantograph/blob/main/README.md) | 68 points | by [rybla](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rybla) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42975171)

In today's tech buzz, Hacker News is spotlighting Pantograph, a cutting-edge structure editor crafted by Jacob Prinz and Henry Blanchette. This intriguing tool, detailed in the POPL 2025 paper titled "Pantograph: A Fluid and Typed Structure Editor", is designed for more intuitive programming by operating directly on a typed syntax tree.

Traditional editors parse text before checking types, but Pantograph flips the script by allowing users to fill 'typed holes' within a syntax tree. This lets programmers manipulate complex expressions like lists with ease, simplifying edits that previously required arduous reconfigurations. A key feature is its 'tree selection' or 'zipper editing', which enhances typical structure editing by maintaining program grammars and, ideally, their types.

Pantograph also takes well-typed programming a step further by introducing a grammar of type diffs to handle how edits alter program types. It offers some automated fixes for type errors, yet wisely allows users to address certain issues later to preserve potentially useful code fragments.

This innovative system is poised to simplify functional programming and is now available for users to explore online. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, Pantograph offers an exciting new approach to writing and editing code efficiently. For those eager to dive deeper into its functionalities or contribute to its development, the project's code is open-source and available for exploration on GitHub.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about **Pantograph**:

### The Age of Agent Experience

#### [Submission URL](https://stytch.com/blog/the-age-of-agent-experience/) | 98 points | by [bobfunk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bobfunk) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974429)

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI agents like ChatGPT Operator and coding tools such as Devin are revolutionizing user interaction with apps by autonomously navigating interfaces, executing tasks, and making requests on users' behalf. This shift necessitates a new focus on designing the "Agent Experience" (AX), where autonomous agents become a primary audience requiring secure, transparent, and efficient handling of data and actions.

Julianna Lamb emphasizes the growing importance of AX alongside traditional User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). Just like UX reshaped how humans interface with technology and DX prioritized developer tools and APIs, AX addresses the needs of AI agents that increasingly perform tasks autonomously. This change is propelled by agents' enhanced capabilities due to advancements in large language models and multi-modal inputs, which imbue them with "agency" – the power to initiate actions and manage tasks independently.

To harness AI agents effectively, businesses must ensure robust systems for agent authentication and authorization, with OAuth being a powerful ally in this regard. OAuth allows secure, delegated access without sharing passwords, using access tokens, and defining specific scopes. This facilitates secure user consent and streamlined agent operations, which are paramount as agents take on more roles traditionally handled by users.

The shift towards AX requires investing in clean, well-defined APIs that provide agents with reliable access to the necessary functionalities. Easy onboarding, minimal friction, and efficient operations are key to maximizing both agent productivity and user satisfaction. In certain cases, such as high-stakes transactions, step-up authentication should be employed to ensure human oversight over crucial actions.

As agents increasingly handle product or platform interactions, companies offering open ecosystems with easy onboarding, open APIs, and secure authentication are set to excel, outpacing closed, vertically integrated systems. By ensuring a quality agent experience, businesses not only support AI-driven agents but enhance their overall offering for human users, driving wider adoption and satisfaction.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the challenges and opportunities in designing for AI agents (Agent Experience or AX) as they interact with systems on users' behalf. Key themes include:  

1. **Authentication & Security**:  
   - **OAuth** is highlighted as a critical tool for secure agent authentication, enabling delegated access without password sharing. Users emphasize its role in tracking agent actions and revoking access if agents misbehave.  
   - **Step-up authentication** (e.g., requiring human approval for sensitive transactions) and **hardware-based security** (physical tokens, USB keys) are proposed for high-stakes actions, though some criticize these as cumbersome.  

2. **CAPTCHA Challenges**:  
   - Traditional CAPTCHAs are seen as ineffective against AI agents, which can solve them cheaply. Alternatives like behavioral analysis (e.g., mouse movement patterns, network signals) or phone-based verification are debated.  

3. **APIs vs. Screen-Scraping**:  
   - Participants advocate for **robust APIs** over screen-scraping, which is brittle and error-prone. Examples like Plaid’s transition from screen-scraping to OAuth in fintech illustrate this shift.  
   - Some argue UIs designed for humans force agents to rely on unreliable methods, leading to calls for standardized, agent-friendly APIs.  

4. **Economic Incentives & Ecosystems**:  
   - Open platforms with **agent-friendly APIs** are predicted to outperform closed systems. Amazon’s dominance is cited as a cautionary example, where prioritizing sales over UX leads to competitive challenges.  
   - Concerns about brands losing control in open ecosystems are balanced against the inevitability of agents reshaping markets.  

5. **Technical Hurdles**:  
   - Developers note the difficulty of creating agents that navigate human-centric UIs, citing Firefox extensions using LLMs that break when websites change.  
   - Proposals include **HATEOAS** (hypermedia APIs) for agent navigation and behavioral heuristics (e.g., timing, deterministic signals) to distinguish agents from humans.  

6. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - Some users question whether OAuth truly meets agent needs yet, pointing to evolving standards. Others joke about agents "working in corporate factories" or replacing humans entirely.  

**Takeaway**: The shift to AX requires rethinking authentication, API design, and security, with OAuth and open ecosystems poised to play central roles. However, technical and economic challenges persist, particularly in balancing automation with human oversight and adapting legacy systems for agents. The discussion reflects both optimism for AI-driven efficiency and skepticism about implementation hurdles.
