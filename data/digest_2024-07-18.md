### Overcoming the limits of current LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://seanpedersen.github.io/posts/overcoming-llm-limits) | 112 points | by [sean_pedersen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sean_pedersen) | [105 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991549)

Today on Hacker News, a post delves into the limitations of large language models (LLMs) that have been dominating the field. These models, while impressive, face issues like hallucinations, lack of confidence estimates, and citations. Hallucinations occur when the content generated by LLMs sounds convincing but is actually inaccurate—something we definitely want to avoid. Lack of confidence estimates can make it hard to determine the reliability of predictions, while citations are crucial for verifying information sources.

The post highlights a recent release by OpenAI that focuses on teaching models to express uncertainty in words, offering a possible solution to the confidence estimate problem. Additionally, techniques such as RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) can be used to incorporate citations into LLM outputs, creating more reliable content. Several resources like perplexity.ai and wikichat.genie.stanford.edu are mentioned as good examples in this regard.

One interesting approach suggested in the post is the idea of "consistency bootstrapping" for LLMs. By excluding contradictory training data and training the model to identify logical inconsistencies within the context provided, researchers hope to create more reliable and accurate models. MIT researchers have already made strides in this area, as outlined in a paper referenced in the post.

By curating high-quality training data and building models based on consistent worldviews, it may be possible to mitigate the limitations currently faced by LLMs. The proposed approach of gradually expanding training data with consistent text documents offers a promising pathway for improving these powerful language models.

The post provides a wealth of references and resources for those interested in exploring these topics further. It's exciting to see the ongoing efforts to enhance LLM performance and accuracy in text generation tasks.

The discussion about the limitations of large language models (LLMs) on Hacker News revolves around various aspects such as hallucinations, confidence estimates, training data quality, and tackling logical inconsistencies within LLMs.

- Users like "mitthrowaway2" and "dwns" emphasize the fundamental design flaw of LLMs in dealing with hallucinations due to the distribution of training data.
- "sean_pedersen" points out the importance of quality over quantity in training data, suggesting that focusing on quality data is crucial for improving LLMs.
- Discussions on confidence scores, training data sources, and the integration of semantic search contexts like in RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) models are highlighted by users such as "nthpcrt" and "bbr."
- The necessity of training high-quality and consistent datasets to address hallucinations is emphasized by "_venkatasg" and "bosch_mind."
- "RodgerTheGreat" discusses the challenges in manually creating properly licensed and verified datasets, while users like "thrsd" and "nyrkk" delve into the ethical considerations and difficulties in developing universally coherent data for LLMs.
- Users like "js8" and "darby_nine" explore the concept of uncertainty in logic and the difficulties in handling logical contradictions and uncertainties within LLMs.

Overall, the discussion delves into the complexities and challenges associated with improving the reliability and accuracy of LLMs by addressing issues such as hallucinations, confidence estimates, data quality, and logical inconsistencies.
