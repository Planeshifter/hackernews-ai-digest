### The LLMentalist Effect

#### [Submission URL](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/) | 114 points | by [zahlman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zahlman) | [110 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983571)

In a thought-provoking piece, Baldur Bjarnason explores the phenomenon he dubs the "LLMentalist Effect," likening the perceived intelligence of chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the age-old art of psychic con tricks. He argues that, despite public perception, LLMs lack the capacity for true reasoning or intelligence. Instead, like a psychic employing "cold reading" techniques, LLMs effectively use statistical guesses and validation statements to create an illusion of understanding and specificity.

Bjarnason suggests that this misconception is much like what happens in a psychic’s con: people see intelligence where none exists, fueled by a psychological trick akin to the Forer effect—a tendency to accept vague and general statements as highly accurate for oneself. He observes that some LLM enthusiasts exhibit a mix of awe and skepticism reminiscent of those charmed by psychic readings.

Critically, Bjarnason illuminates the process behind psychic cons, drawing fascinating parallels to AI interactions. He explains how psychics—and by extension, LLMs—craft convincing illusions by catering to eagerly self-selecting audiences, setting charismatic scenes, and offering statements that appear personalized yet are broadly applicable. Through such tactics, both tap into subjective validation to leave their audiences believing that something truly extraordinary has occurred.

Ultimately, Bjarnason stresses that while many use cases for LLMs appear valuable, they risk veering into the realm of pseudoscience and overhyped tech narratives if not scrutinized carefully. Concluding with a nod to skepticism, his insights invite us to question the nature of intelligence and how easily we can be enchanted by the seemingly miraculous capabilities of both psychics and machines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion**

The discussion explores the analogy between LLMs and psychic cold-reading techniques, debating whether these models exhibit true intelligence or merely a convincing illusion. Key themes emerge:

1. **Illusion vs. Reality of Intelligence**  
   - Participants compare LLMs to psychics, arguing both use statistical patterns and vague, validated statements to create a false sense of specificity. One user notes that LLMs, like psychics, rely on "self-selecting audiences" prone to anthropomorphizing outputs.  
   - The "Eliza effect" is highlighted, where humans project intelligence onto systems through charismatic interactions (e.g., a Santa Claus-themed program charming children).

2. **Mechanics of LLMs**  
   - LLMs are framed as *stochastic parrots* that mimic reasoning via statistical pattern-matching, not true understanding. For example, generating grammatically correct sentences doesn’t equate to comprehension.  
   - Critics argue that RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) may inadvertently train models to produce confident, appealing answers rather than truthful ones, mirroring psychics offering "comforting news" to clients.

3. **Defining Intelligence**  
   - Debate arises over *intelligence* as a concept: some define it narrowly (problem-solving ability), while others emphasize consciousness, awareness, or collective/biological intelligence. AI researchers are accused of prioritizing "usefulness" over philosophical rigor.  
   - A divide exists between those viewing intelligence as *information processing* (applied even to plants or cells) and those insisting on human-like reasoning and consciousness.

4. **Practical Utility vs. Hype**  
   - Some assert LLMs’ value lies in utility regardless of "thinking" capability. Others warn of overinvestment based on inflated expectations, likening it to the 2000s dot-com bubble.  
   - Skeptics highlight limitations: LLMs fail at puzzles requiring structured reasoning, and commercially viable uses often lack transformative impact, prioritizing cost savings over innovation.

5. **Criticism of Research Narratives**  
   - Critics accuse AI researchers of vague definitions and PR-driven narratives, dismissing interdisciplinary insights (e.g., cognitive science). One user laments that discussions about intelligence often devolve into abstract, unproductive debates.

**Conclusion**  
The thread reflects a mix of skepticism and cautious optimism. While LLMs’ practical applications are acknowledged, participants stress the need for clearer frameworks to distinguish statistical pattern-matching from genuine reasoning. The parallel to psychic trickery underscores broader concerns about anthropomorphism and commercialization in AI discourse.

### Value-Based Deep RL Scales Predictably

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04327) | 66 points | by [bearseascape](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bearseascape) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979846)

In an intriguing new paper on arXiv, researchers Oleh Rybkin, Michal Nauman, Preston Fu, Charlie Snell, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, and Aviral Kumar explore an essential aspect of machine learning—scaling predictability—in value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditionally, the machine learning community has viewed scaling RL as notoriously unpredictable. However, this team shows that it's more straightforward than previously thought when dealt with the right approach.

The research breaks down the scaling process into three key findings. Firstly, the team discovered that the relationship between data and compute demands for achieving specific performance levels forms a Pareto frontier. They identified a crucial metric called the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio that influences this frontier. Understanding this helps in predicting the data requirements given more compute, and vice versa.

Secondly, the researchers devised a strategy for optimal resource allocation. For any given performance target, they outlined how best to distribute resources across data and compute to maximize output. This leads to selecting hyperparameters that best utilize the given budget.

Thirdly, they addressed concerns unique to RL, such as overfitting and plasticity loss, by estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters. This insight allowed them to manage and optimize these effects, assisting in achieving more consistent scaling behavior.

Their comprehensive examination of three RL algorithms (SAC, BRO, and PQL) across platforms like DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym underlines the validity of their approach. Their methodology offers a promising direction for scaling RL systems predictably, making large-scale experiments more manageable and less guesswork-intensive. This breakthrough stands to simplify previously challenging aspects of machine learning, paving the way for more robust and scalable AI applications.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**  
1. **Comparison to Prior Work**: A user references a YouTube video (unlinked) highlighting historical discussions on compute vs. data scaling, suggesting potential parallels or contrasts to the paper's findings. They also commend the paper for "rediscovering fundamental theorems," implying the work integrates key ideas for predictable scaling.  

2. **Scalability Questions**: A commenter questions how scalable value-based off-policy RL (like SAC) truly is in practice, contrasting it with policy-based methods. They raise concerns about whether the approach’s reliance on recorded data (rather than actively exploring environments) might limit scalability.  

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity & Optimism**: A third user acknowledges RL’s notorious finickiness with hyperparameters, making research stressful, but praises the paper for enabling concrete predictions about training settings. They express excitement that this work could simplify RL training, leading to more reliable "recipes" and expanding research accessibility.  

**Overall Tone**: The discussion reflects guarded optimism—applauding efforts to systematize RL scaling while flagging practical hurdles (scalability nuances, hyperparameter tuning). The paper is seen as a step toward demystifying RL experimentation.

### Bolt: Bootstrap long chain-of-thought in LLMs without distillation [pdf]

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03860) | 13 points | by [TaurenHunter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TaurenHunter) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979901)

In an exciting advancement in the world of language models, a new study titled "BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without Distillation" by Bo Pang and colleagues presents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike earlier methods that heavily relied on distillation from existing models—like OpenAI's o1—BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought) introduces a novel strategy to achieve superior reasoning without costly reliance on models or intensive human input.

The BOLT method is remarkable not just for its innovative approach but also for its simplicity. It requires only a few in-context learning examples, as evidenced by their experiment with just 10 examples. The process involves three key stages: bootstrapping LongCoT data using in-context learning on a standard instruct model, LongCoT supervised finetuning, and continued online training for refinement. The team employed the Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model, successfully scaling their strategy across various model sizes.

The study yielded impressive outcomes across multiple benchmarks, including Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, and MATH500, showcasing BOLT's ability to enhance reasoning in diverse tasks beyond the traditional focus areas such as math and coding. This research not only opens new avenues for the development of LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities but also underscores the potential for simplified, scalable methods in deploying complex AI functionalities.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around clarifying the concept of model **distillation** and challenging claims that methods like BOLT (or other models such as DeepSeek) fully avoid distillation from existing LLMs (e.g., OpenAI). Key points:  

1. **Distillation Definition**:  
   - Distillation typically transfers knowledge from a larger "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model by training the student to mimic the teacher's token probability distributions or outputs.  
   - This requires aligned tokenization schemes and training data from the teacher.  

2. **Debates Over Terminology**:  
   - Some argue that fine-tuning smaller models on outputs from larger models (even with limited data) could still be considered distillation, albeit simplified.  
   - Critics (e.g., user **krtp**) distinguish true distillation (optimizing KL divergence between teacher/student distributions) from standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which lacks alignment with the teacher’s token-level distributions.  

3. **BOLT’s Claims vs. Reality**:  
   - Comments suggest DeepSeek and similar models likely used distillation (or analogous techniques), contradicting assertions of "no distillation."  
   - The BOLT paper’s reliance on in-context examples for bootstrapping might still align with lightweight distillation-like processes.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - User **nckthgrk** notes distillation often requires millions of examples depending on model size, raising questions about whether BOLT’s 10-example approach fully captures general reasoning capabilities.  

**Key Takeaway**: The debate highlights ambiguity around defining "distillation," with skeptics arguing many methods (including BOLT) implicitly rely on knowledge transfer akin to distillation’s principles. Broader implications for LLM advancement depend on clearer definitions and ethical transparency.
