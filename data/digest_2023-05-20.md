### How Somali workers in the US are fighting Amazon’s surveillance machine

#### [Submission URL](https://www.codastory.com/authoritarian-tech/amazon-workers-surveillance/) | 90 points | by [f4f4f4f43f](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=f4f4f4f43f) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36015169)

The state of Minnesota in the US has passed legislation that could force Amazon to improve labor conditions for warehouse workers. The pioneering workplace safety bill, which proponents say is the strongest labor protection legislation in the country for people laboring in Amazon-style warehouses, mandates that any warehouse employing more than 250 workers must provide the quotas and work speed metrics used to appraise worker performance. It also prohibits retaliation against those who have signed up to such union drives. Over 2,000 Amazon workers in eight nations recently participated in a survey which suggested that performance and monitoring systems had taken a physical and emotional toll on employees’ wellbeing.

The comments on this article discuss the treatment of workers at Amazon. There is a wide range of opinions, but some believe that Amazon focuses too much on profit at the expense of the well-being of workers. Others suggest that customers who demand cheap products are partly responsible for the poor working conditions. Additionally, there is a debate about the efficacy of such legislation. Finally, there is speculation that Amazon may be planning to close its warehouses in Minnesota due to the recent labor disputes.

Axle OS, a project started in 2016, has evolved into a microkernel and userspace, boasting a compositing window manager, a TTF renderer, a TCP/IP stack, a GameBoy emulator, an ACPI parser, and much more. With support for C- and Rust-based GUI toolkits, HTML/CSS rendering engines, and a MLFQ scheduler, axle offers a rich development environment for hobbyists interested in exploring OS principals. The project is free and open source, licensed under MIT, and hosted on Github.

Axle OS is a microkernel and userspace project that offers support for GUI toolkits, HTML/CSS rendering engines, and a MLFQ scheduler, among other features. It is free and open source, licensed under MIT, and hosted on Github. Some users discuss the history of hobbyist OS building since the 1990s and note that some of today's OS designers are likely influenced by Apple's HIG guidelines. Others recommend resources for those interested in OS development, such as OSDev Wiki. There are also discussions about signal handling, system resource allocation, and the challenges of building an OS from scratch. Some compare Axle OS to BeOS, while others suggest that QNX may be a similar OS with calling MsgSend functionality.

### Using ChatGPT for home automation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.atomic14.com/2023/05/14/is-this-the-future-of-home-automation.html) | 248 points | by [iamflimflam1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iamflimflam1) | [103 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36013571)

An interesting experiment has been conducted with ChatGPT, which was used to develop an API that controls smart lights connected to a Raspberry Pi. This means the lights can be toggled on and off using natural language commands. The author of the experiment believes language models like this could be used to connect a variety of systems in a simpler way than using APIs. The author was able to generate most of the code using ChatGPT, reducing the amount of coding necessary. However, one downside is the need for an OpenAPI or Swagger file.

Participants discussed the potential for language models like ChatGPT to simplify connecting a variety of systems and some provided alternative prompts for the controls. Others discussed the limitations of ChatGPT and its ability to generate certain types of content and noted the importance of privacy in AI design. Some also discussed the potential for LLMs to create novel color combinations in interior design. Additionally, participants discussed the challenges of developing IoT infrastructures due to the need for constant connectivity and the limitations of consumer-level devices.

### Does AI mean we don't need the Semantic Web?

#### [Submission URL](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/05/does-ai-mean-we-dont-need-the-semantic-web/) | 49 points | by [edent](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=edent) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36011067)

The question of whether AI makes the Semantic Web irrelevant is explored in a thought-provoking article on Edwin Brady's blog. While the Semantic Web relies on marking up HTML for machines to process, the development of AI means that machines can now interpret and understand text designed for humans. However, the article argues that standardized syntax and semantics are still extremely useful and necessary, and there are many cases where "AI" can't handle complex information yet. The article also discusses the challenges of unit testing and maintaining AI text-processing systems.Some commenters argued that AI-generated content is often meaningless and overwhelming, while others noted that the Semantic Web is still necessary for standardized syntax and semantics. Additionally, there was some discussion about the cost and scalability of using the Semantic Web for tagging and reviewing content. Some commenters also provided examples of projects that combine AI and Semantic Web technologies. Finally, there was some discussion about the potential hazards and benefits of AI, particularly in the context of its cost and performance compared to manual labor.

### EU approves new rules for tracing crypto transfers, introduces 1000€ limit

#### [Submission URL](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230414IPR80133/crypto-assets-green-light-to-new-rules-for-tracing-transfers-in-the-eu) | 56 points | by [yamrzou](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yamrzou) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36010621)

The European Parliament has passed new rules for tracing transfers of crypto-assets in the EU, marking the first piece of EU legislation regarding cryptocurrency transfers. This aims to ensure that crypto transfers can be traced and suspicious transactions can be blocked, with the same rules applying to transactions above €1000 from self-hosted wallets when interacting with hosted wallets managed by crypto-assets service providers. Additionally, new common rules on supervision, consumer protection, and environmental safeguards for crypto-assets were also approved, including crypto-currencies. The new legal framework will support market integrity, financial stability, and regulate public offers of crypto-assets. To reduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies, significant service providers will have to disclose their energy consumption and the European Securities and Markets Authority will create a public register for non-compliant crypto-assets service providers. There are mixed opinions in the comments, with some users supporting the legislation while others criticize it.
