#### [Submission URL](https://thedeepdive.ca/shopify-employee-breaks-nda-to-reveal-firm-quietly-replacing-laid-off-workers-with-ai/) | 421 points | by [notRobot](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=notRobot) | [522 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36828409)

In a Twitter thread, a Shopify employee has violated their non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to expose the company's controversial actions and strategic direction. The employee revealed that Shopify promised job security to its staff in early 2022 but carried out massive layoffs later in the year. These job cuts were driven by a shift towards replacing full-time employees with cheaper contract labor and an increased reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) support. Shopify recently announced the upcoming launch of "Sidekick," an AI assistant for its merchants. CEO Tobi Lutke has publicly stated his belief that companies can achieve higher revenues with fewer employees, which has negatively impacted customer satisfaction. The reduction in staff has led to significant delays in customer support and an overwhelmed team monitoring fraudulent stores. The employee's thread also raised concerns about the well-being of Shopify's workforce, the company's shift in target market focus, and the impact on small businesses. With public scrutiny growing, Shopify faces the challenge of restoring trust and addressing the consequences of its decisions.

The discussion on the submission revolves around customer service and the role of AI in replacing human employees. Some users share their negative experiences with customer service at various companies, highlighting issues such as scripted responses, lack of problem-solving, and language barriers. Others argue that customer satisfaction is crucial for businesses and that investing in quality support can lead to long-term profitability. There are also discussions about alternative approaches to customer service, such as personalized training and interactive platforms. Additionally, there are comments on chargebacks, small claims courts, and Google's standard information. Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of balancing technology and human interaction in customer service.

### Computational Chemistry Using PyTorch

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Mariewelt/OpenChem) | 76 points | by [gtsnexp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gtsnexp) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36825353)

OpenChem: Deep Learning toolkit for Computational Chemistry and Drug Design Research

OpenChem is a deep learning toolkit for computational chemistry with a PyTorch backend. Its main goal is to make deep learning models an easy-to-use tool for computational chemistry and drug design researchers.

Some of the main features of OpenChem include a modular design with a unified API, making it easy to combine different modules, fast training with multi-gpu support, utilities for data preprocessing, and Tensorboard support.

OpenChem supports various functionalities such as classification (binary or multi-class), regression, multi-task learning, and generative models. It also supports different data types including sequences of characters like SMILES strings or amino-acid sequences, and molecular graphs.

To get started with OpenChem, you need a modern NVIDIA GPU with compute capability 3.5 or newer, Python 3.5 or newer (preferably Anaconda distribution), and CUDA 9.0 or newer. Installation instructions are provided in the documentation, including installation with Anaconda and Docker.

If you use OpenChem in your projects, the creators ask that you cite their paper and acknowledge the project's support from Carnegie Mellon University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and NVIDIA Corp.

OpenChem aims to provide a powerful and user-friendly toolkit for researchers in computational chemistry and drug design, making it easier to leverage deep learning models for their work.

The discussion on this submission started with a user named "sndn" mentioning another deep learning toolkit called DeepChem, which has a similar purpose to OpenChem. The user then provided a link to the DeepChem GitHub repository.

A user named "mathisfun123" responded to this comment, stating that the use of "democratizing" and "commandifying" in the title of the submission's summary were awkwardly worded. They explained that while some words may seem unnecessary or completely wrong, they are important to accurately describe concepts. They also pointed out that democratizing does not mean liberalizing and that using words like democratizing without proper context can lead to confusion. They provided examples of how the term democratizing has been used incorrectly in the past.

Another user named "bglzr" added to the discussion by mentioning that Merriam Webster traces the meaning of democratizing back to 1798, further supporting the point made by "mathisfun123".

The conversation then shifted to a recommendation by a user named "wstrnr" who suggested using RDKit and PyDD as alternatives to OpenChem. They specifically mentioned installing RDKit using PyDD extensions in Jupyter, which might be slower but could be useful for students, instructors, or team members who do not want to install additional software.

User "tptck" appreciated the links and thanked the commenters for sharing useful information. They also asked a question about which is harder, chemistry or computer science.

Another user named "wstrnr" responded to "tptck" by recommending Tequila, a Python library that wraps Psi4, PySCF, and PyQuante for quantum chemistry expectation values. They provided a link to the Tequila GitHub repository.

A user named "dcttplgc" showed interest in the subject and mentioned that they will definitely check it out in the following weeks.

The last comment came from a user named "voz_", who expressed their interest in contributing to the project.

Overall, the discussion covered various topics, including alternative tools, the accuracy of wording, the meaning of certain terms, and recommendations for related libraries.
