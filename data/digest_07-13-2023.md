Sevag H has developed a free AI-based music demixing web app that allows users to decompose songs into various components like bass, drums, vocals, and more. Powered by the Open-Unmix AI model with the UMX-L pretrained weights, the app runs locally in the user's browser, ensuring data privacy as no files are uploaded. The app works well on computers but may run slowly on smartphones. Users can try out the demo using a free song by Jaxius Music or upload their own music files to use the demixer. The app comes with disclaimers regarding non-commercial usage and the CPU and memory requirements of the task. The app's technical details include the use of C++ and Eigen3 for inference code, Emscripten for WebAssembly compilation, and compressed model weights. The project is available on GitHub for those interested in the source code.

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is investigating OpenAI's popular chatbot, ChatGPT, over concerns that it may have generated incorrect information about users, potentially leading to consumer harm. The investigation also includes an examination of OpenAI's privacy and data security practices. The FTC has requested that OpenAI provide documentation on various issues, including company policies, financial earnings, and details about the large language models used to train ChatGPT. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman responded on Twitter, expressing disappointment at the leak and affirming the company's commitment to ensuring the safety and pro-consumer nature of its technology. This investigation marks a milestone in government regulatory action concerning the AI industry. OpenAI has previously advocated for AI regulation and engaged with lawmakers and government officials on the matter.

The discussion on Hacker News about the FTC investigation into OpenAI's ChatGPT was varied and encompassed several topics. Some comments focused on the potential implications of AI regulation and the power dynamics in the industry. One commenter noted the possibility of OpenAI being granted a monopoly if Sam Altman's strategy succeeds. Others pointed out that other companies are rapidly catching up to OpenAI in terms of AI models and capabilities. Some users expressed skepticism about Altman's statements and motives, suggesting that he may be playing a political game or focusing on marketing rather than addressing the concerns about ChatGPT. There was also discussion about the limitations and dangers of AI, with comments mentioning the requirements for competition and potential theoretical roadblocks. The intellectual property aspect was also brought up, with one user mentioning the potential value of intellectual property in the future and another user sharing a presentation by Yann LeCun on the path to AGI. Some commenters emphasized the need for caution and highlighted the risks associated with machine intelligence.

### Sag-AFTRA President: “we're in jeopardy of being replaced by machines”

#### [Submission URL](https://deadline.com/2023/07/sag-aftra-fran-drescher-were-being-victimized-by-a-greedy-entity-1235437292/) | 17 points | by [ericzawo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ericzawo) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36716506)

In a press conference yesterday, SAG-AFTRA President Fran Drescher and National Executive Director Duncan Crabtree-Ireland announced that the actors' strike is expected to last for a while. Drescher gave an impassioned speech, saying that they had no choice but to strike due to being victimized by a "very greedy entity." She expressed shock at the way studio executives are treating actors and stated that if they don't stand tall now, they will be in jeopardy of being replaced by machines and big business. The AMPTP's strategy for the writers' strike is to keep it going until October when scribes would run out of money. Drescher criticized this approach as "cruel but necessary evil." Both Drescher and Crabtree-Ireland expressed disappointment in the lack of an acceptable deal, with Crabtree-Ireland highlighting how the current streaming model has undercut performers' residual incomes. Despite these challenges, they expressed solidarity among SAG-AFTRA members and their resolve to fight for the future of their careers. They also mentioned being open to negotiations with the AMPTP. The strike officially commenced today, with picketing scheduled to take place at Netflix, Paramount, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Disney.
