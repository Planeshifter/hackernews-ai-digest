### Public servants uneasy as government 'spy' robot prowls federal offices

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/public-servants-uneasy-as-government-spy-robot-prowls-federal-offices-1.7239711) | 31 points | by [colinprince](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=colinprince) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40738876)

In a controversial move, a "spy" robot has been causing unrest among public servants in federal offices in Gatineau, Quebec. The robot, dubbed "the little robot" by employees, is part of the VirBrix platform and is equipped with over 20 sensors and a 360-degree camera. It collects data on various workplace conditions such as air quality, light levels, and even measures gases like CO2 and radon.

While the government insists that the robot is used to optimize workspaces and cannot identify individual employees, union representatives and employees feel that it invades their privacy and is unnecessary. The Government Services Union raised concerns about employees feeling constantly monitored and questioned the need for such surveillance when attendance and performance can already be monitored through existing methods.

As the federal government plans to transition employees back to the office, the robot's presence has stirred up concerns about control rather than creating a positive work environment. The union is also worried about the data being collected, especially after a previous incident involving sensors at workstations. Despite assurances from the government that the robot is only meant to improve workplace efficiency, employees remain skeptical about its intentions.

The government has defended the robot, stating that its purpose is to evaluate office space utilization and help in reducing the office footprint in the future. The minister of public services and procurement emphasized that the technology is anonymous and focuses on creating better work environments for employees. The creators of the robot also clarified that it does not retain identifying information about individuals and only collects data related to environmental health and safety.

As the debate over the role of technology in monitoring employees continues, public servants remain uneasy about the presence of the "spy" robot in their workplaces, expressing concerns about privacy, trust, and the implications of such surveillance on their daily routines.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the controversial use of a "spy" robot in federal offices in Gatineau, Quebec. 

1. **tmm**: The concern is raised that employers installing cameras in the workplace without notifying employees is considered bad, as it can violate privacy and trust.
2. **lcnPylGDnU4H9OF**: The deployment of cameras in the workplace leads to employees feeling constantly monitored and can be distracting, impacting their work productivity.
3. **sxthr**: It is clarified that the 360-degree cameras do not capture identifiable information about individual employees, focusing on environmental data instead.
4. **rhlz**: A comparison is made to dystopian novels like 1984, highlighting concerns about surveillance making employees uncomfortable and affecting their daily routines.
5. **mistrial9**: Research on the use of personal AI assistants in Walmart labs raises questions about privacy and data handling in the workplace.
6. **Am4TIfIsER0ppos**: There is a suggestion that robots could be used as a substitute for certain tasks, like serving masters or servants.

The discussion spans various viewpoints, reflecting concerns about privacy, trust, and the implications of surveillance technology in the workplace.
