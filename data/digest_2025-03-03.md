### A float walks into a gradual type system

#### [Submission URL](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2025/a-float-walks-into-a-gradual-type-system) | 23 points | by [ruuda](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ruuda) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43239111)

**Introducing RCL: A New Configuration Language for Enhanced JSON Utility**

In the world of configuration files, where JSON, YAML, and TOML reign supreme, a fresh contender enters the fray: RCL, a gradually typed superset of JSON designed to boost abstraction and reuse while maintaining a simple, functional flair. Think of RCL as a blend of JSON's straightforwardness and the functional capabilities you'd find in tools like jq, sans the hassle of consulting a large language model for query crafting.

**The Float Dilemma**

RCL's journey to becoming a comprehensive JSON superset encountered a bump with number representation. While integers were in the bag early on, introducing floats—numbers with decimal points—posed a considerable challenge due to conflicting design principles. JSON itself leaves number semantics open to interpretation, leading to varied treatments across languages like Python and JavaScript.

The main hurdle? Ensuring RCL could generate compatible configurations across different systems without blurring the line between integers and floats. Silent conversions—adding or stripping decimal points—were off the table to keep configurations precise and reliable.

**Types and Trade-offs**

RCL's gradual type system aims to curb bugs and enhance code clarity by distinguishing between ints and floats. However, this seemingly simple distinction opens up a can of worms. How much should be modeled in the type system? Should there be unsigned integers, different integer sizes, or even refined types?

Developer musings led RCL's creator to reconsider the necessity of such distinctions, weighing the benefits against complexity costs. The objective remains clear: RCL should stay intuitive and predictable.

**Wishlist vs. Reality**

The wish for a separate integer type in RCL comes with implications:

1. **Distinct Int and Float Types**: Valuable for operations and config schemas that differentiate between the two.
2. **Universal Comparability**: Ensures equality checks across values, crucial for heterogeneous lists akin to JSON.
3. **Referential Transparency**: Substitutable values should yield consistent results, a cornerstone of simplicity and ease of reasoning.

However, a clash arises when attempting to marry these principles with type separation. If 1 is numerically different from 1.0, yet both are equal, how do we handle assignments across int and float types without chaos?

**Navigating the Path Forward**

RCL could abandon the separate integer type, merging all numbers into a singular "Number" type. This would align with some programming languages, streamlining operations at the potential cost of nuance in specific contexts.

Ultimately, RCL is shaped by a commitment to being "simple and boring"—a practical tool that developers can quickly grasp and utilize without fuss. This dedication means making tough choices, ensuring that RCL remains intuitive while providing the utility developers expect from a modern configuration language. 

RCL is not about reinventing the wheel but refining it, offering a cohesive balance that respects familiar programming paradigms while expanding JSON's capabilities. As RCL evolves, its guiding principle remains clear: empower, don't overcomplexify.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around RCL's handling of integers vs. floats revolves around practical challenges, edge cases, and philosophical debates about type systems:

1. **Equality and Precision Issues**:  
   Users highlight problems with comparing integers and floats (e.g., `1 == 1.0`), noting that float comparisons are inherently unreliable due to precision limits (e.g., `0.1 + 0.1 != 0.2`). Edge cases like `NaN`, `-0`, and `±Infinity` further complicate equality checks and type semantics.

2. **Ambiguity in Representation**:  
   Concerns arise about how RCL might handle numeric representations across systems. For example, JSON’s lack of precision specifications can lead to confusion (e.g., `13.0` vs. `13`), and allowing excessive zeros (e.g., `14+` decimal places) risks ambiguity in underlying values.

3. **Type System Semantics**:  
   Debate centers on whether distinct `Int`/`Float` types are worth the complexity. Some argue that strict type separation could break referential transparency (e.g., substituting `1` with `1.0` might fail in certain contexts). Others suggest decomposing numeric values during comparisons or assignments to reconcile type differences.

4. **Practical Use Cases**:  
   Floats as list indexes (e.g., `0.5`) are criticized for being invalid in many contexts, requiring runtime checks. While RCL might allow this flexibility, users warn that float imprecision could lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., in loops or mathematical operations).

5. **Simplicity vs. Nuance**:  
   The community questions whether RCL should adopt a unified `Number` type (simpler but less precise) or enforce strict type distinctions (complex but clearer). The trade-off between developer intuition and technical precision remains unresolved.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores the tension between RCL’s goal of simplicity and the inherent complexity of numeric type systems. Developers emphasize the need for clear semantics around floats, edge cases, and practical usability to avoid pitfalls seen in JSON and other languages.

However, Outlook’s newer versions are dropping COM support, signaling a shift.
   - Critiques of COM’s complexity and Microsoft’s strategy: Users argue that COM-based integrations are brittle, slow, and lock developers into Windows. Microsoft’s focus on cross-platform (macOS/web) and subscription-driven models (e.g., M365) reduces incentives to maintain COM.

2. **Alternatives to COM**:
   - Suggestions include **Office Scripts**, **Power Automate**, or browser-based automation (e.g., Selenium WebDriver) for cross-platform compatibility.
   - Projects like **OpenAdapt** (an open-source RPA tool with COM support) and **DavMail** (for programmatic email access) are highlighted as alternatives.

3. **Criticism of Microsoft’s Direction**:
   - Users express frustration with Microsoft deprioritizing desktop features (e.g., Outlook’s web version being slow, lacking dark mode) to push cloud services. Some see this as a vendor lock-in strategy to sustain subscriptions.
   - Satya Nadella’s “cloud-first” pivot is blamed for neglecting desktop app innovation, forcing developers toward web-based or low-common-denominator solutions.

4. **Project Feedback**:
   - Skepticism about building AI-driven desktop tools on COM, given its uncertain future. Some suggest focusing on modern RPA (Robotic Process Automation) frameworks instead.
   - A few users express interest in contributing to SmartestKid’s development, particularly for Office integration or personality quirks (e.g., a Clippy-like assistant).

### Notable Quotes:
- **On COM’s relevance**: *“COM isn’t deprecated, but Outlook dropping support is a sign. Modern add-ins require cross-platform compatibility, which COM can’t offer.”*  
- **On Microsoft’s strategy**: *“They’re turning Office into a subscription service. Desktop versions are now the lowest priority.”*  
- **On alternatives**: *“Use Office Scripts or Power Automate if you want to avoid COM’s headaches.”*

### Broader Implications:
The discussion underscores the tension between legacy desktop automation (powerful but Windows-bound) and modern, cloud-centric workflows. For projects like SmartestKid, balancing backward compatibility with future-proofing (e.g., web APIs, cross-platform support) will be critical. The community’s mixed reactions highlight both enthusiasm for AI-driven desktop tools and skepticism about relying on aging Microsoft frameworks.
