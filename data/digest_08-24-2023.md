Today, a groundbreaking large language model called Code Llama has been released. This state-of-the-art model is capable of generating code and natural language about code from both code and natural language prompts. Code Llama is free for both research and commercial use.

Code Llama is built on top of Llama 2 and is available in three models: Code Llama, Codel Llama (Python specialized for Python), and Code Llama - Instruct (fine-tuned for understanding natural language instructions). In benchmark testing, Code Llama outperformed state-of-the-art publicly available large language models on code tasks.

The release of Code Llama is a significant advancement for generative AI in the coding field. It has the potential to improve workflows, boost productivity, and lower the barrier to entry for people learning to code. The model can be used as a productivity and educational tool to help programmers write more robust and well-documented software.

Code Llama works by further training Llama 2 on code-specific datasets, enhancing its coding capabilities. It supports popular programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, PHP, Typescript (Javascript), C#, and Bash. The model can generate code, provide natural language explanations about code, assist with code completion, and even aid in debugging.

Three sizes of Code Llama are available, with 7B, 13B, and 34B parameters respectively. Each model is trained with 500B tokens of code and code-related data. The 7B and 13B models feature fill-in-the-middle (FIM) capability for code completion. The larger 34B model provides the best results and coding assistance but may have higher latency. The models can handle input sequences up to 100,000 tokens.

Two additional variations of Code Llama have been fine-tuned: Code Llama - Python, specifically designed for Python code, and Code Llama - Instruct, which excels at understanding natural language instructions. The latter is recommended for code generation as it has been trained to generate safe and helpful answers in natural language.

Code Llama's performance was evaluated using popular coding benchmarks. In tests, it outperformed existing solutions on code completion and code writing tasks. For example, the Code Llama 34B model scored 53.7% on HumanEval and 56.2% on Mostly Basic Python Programming (MBPP), making it one of the top-performing models.

It's worth noting that while Code Llama brings many benefits, it also comes with risks. Responsible AI development is essential, and precautions have been taken to mitigate potential issues.
