### Visualizing Neural Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://photonlines.substack.com/p/grokking-neural-networks) | 33 points | by [photon_lines](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=photon_lines) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37248013)

activation function and a learning rate of 0.1. The step function will determine whether the perceptron "fires" or not based on the total input.

Step 4: Iterate through the Dataset

Now, we will iterate through the dataset and update the weights and bias based on the perceptron's prediction.

For each input data example, we will calculate the output of the perceptron using the current weights and bias. We will then compare the predicted output to the target output and calculate the error.

If the predicted output is not equal to the target output, we will update the weights and bias using the following formulas:

new_weight = old_weight + (learning_rate * error * input_data)
new_bias = old_bias + (learning_rate * error)

Step 5: Repeat Steps 4

We repeat Step 4 for a number of iterations or until the perceptron achieves satisfactory accuracy.

Step 6: Test the Perceptron

Once the perceptron has been trained, we can test it on new data to see how accurately it can classify inputs.

By training the perceptron using the supervised learning approach and adjusting the weights and bias based on the error, we can make the perceptron learn from its mistakes and improve its ability to make accurate predictions.

Neural networks, like the perceptron, are the building blocks of more complex models used in various machine learning tasks. By combining multiple perceptrons in layers, we can create deep neural networks capable of solving more sophisticated problems.

So, the next time you hear about neural networks, you'll have a clearer understanding of their basic workings and how they can learn from data to make predictions.
