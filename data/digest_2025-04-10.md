#### [Submission URL](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/transporting-activations) | 87 points | by [2bit](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=2bit) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646466)

In an exciting development for AI enthusiasts and developers, Apple's machine learning researchers have unveiled a groundbreaking technique designed to give users fine-grained control over large generative models. This approach, called Activation Transport (AcT), promises to make it easier to steer the output of these powerful models without significant computational costs or the risk of performance degradation. AcT leverages optimal transport theory to guide model activations towards desired behaviors, a method that could revolutionize how we interact with AI in content generation, creative writing, and AI-assisted design.

Unlike traditional methods such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) or instruction fine-tuning, which can be resource-heavy and impractical for highly complex models, AcT provides a modality-agnostic solution. This means it can work seamlessly across different types of generative models, from text processors to image generators, delivering consistent and reliable results even when minimal computational overhead is involved.

Apple's novel framework solves the problem of prior activation-steering techniques by introducing an interpretable intervention strength parameter, ensuring that activation adjustments remain within the model’s natural dynamics. This approach effectively avoids the pitfalls of unpredictability and loss of model performance, which were common issues with older techniques that could lead to bizarre outputs like pink elephants popping up in unforeseen places.

The researchers have ingeniously simplified the estimation of activation transport by focusing on linear and independent maps, which enables fast and efficient inference. This innovation, dubbed Linear Activation Transport (Linear-AcT), works universally across both language and image generation models, making it a first-of-its-kind conditioning algorithm applicable without modifications to current AI systems.

As the tech community gears up for Apple’s presentation at the ICLR 2025, the release of this technique’s code will undoubtedly open up new possibilities for developers to harness the full capabilities of AI models, aligning outputs more precisely with user expectations and enhancing the overall user experience.

The discussion around Apple's Activation Transport (AcT) technique reveals both enthusiasm and critical inquiry. Key points include:

1. **Pink Elephants & Model Control**: Users reference the submission’s example of unwanted outputs (e.g., "pink elephants") and debate how AcT’s optimal transport approach might resolve such issues. Comparisons are drawn to methods like LoRA in Stable Diffusion, with questions about practical implementation of transport maps to adjust model behavior efficiently.

2. **Multimodal & On-Device Potential**: Speculation arises about Apple leveraging AcT for on-device generative AI (e.g., in rumored tools like Image Playground), avoiding cloud dependency. The modality-agnostic nature of AcT is seen as a strength for applications in text, images, and beyond.

3. **Technical Debates**:  
   - Users ponder how optimal transport maps are applied across complex model layers without bloating compute costs.  
   - Some liken AcT to a "non-RLHF breakthrough," praising its potential to avoid reinforcement learning’s overhead.  

4. **AI Intelligence & Safety**:  
   - A thread debates whether controlling AI requires suppressing "independent thought" or basic behaviors, with warnings against anthropomorphizing models.  
   - Concerns about AI safety emerge, highlighting vulnerabilities in consumer GPU infrastructure and the costs of securing AI systems against misuse.  

5. **Broader Implications**: Skepticism mixes with optimism—some question if AcT truly solves controllability at scale, while others anticipate new creative and technical use cases. The release of code and Apple’s ICLR 2025 presentation are flagged as milestones to watch.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious excitement for AcT’s practical benefits but underscores unresolved challenges in AI control, safety, and implementation.

#### [Submission URL](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/owning-my-own-data-part-1-integrating-a-self-hosted-calendar-solution/) | 370 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [139 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643343)

Imagine having control over your entire data ecosystem, from files to calendars, without being tied to big tech giants. That's the journey our intrepid tech enthusiast has embarked upon in a series about reclaiming tech independence and data sovereignty. 

In the kickoff installment, they share a glimpse into their world of hyper-travel, involving job duties, romantic commitments across miles, and the urgent need for a reliable and private calendar system. Their existing calendar setup, tangled in timezone challenges and lacking in flexibility, was far from ideal. Commercial products like Google Calendar have dominated the scene, while options laden with subscription fees and privacy concerns just don't cut it for someone seeking more autonomy.

Determined to overhaul this situation, they embarked on building a customized, self-hosted calendar solution. Their key requirements included seamless synchronization across devices, cross-timezone management, privacy, and automatic event integration, including from a self-hosted flight tracker. The initial workaround involved hand-crafting YAML files and generating ICS files—a clever but ultimately cumbersome setup for long-term use.

Recognizing the limitations, our innovator turned to CalDAV, an extension of WebDAV designed for calendar applications. While this move means greater self-hosting, and likely costs, it represents a step forward in breaking the chains of big tech dependency. With the first phase documented, readers can look forward to more chronicles on this quest for digital autonomy—a journey filled with trials, innovation, and the hope for a broader revolution in personalized tech solutions. Stay tuned!

**Summary of Discussion:**

   - **kridsdale1** highlights CalDAV's fragility, especially with non-compliant servers like Google’s, leading to sync issues.  
   - **JMAP** (JSON Meta Application Protocol) is proposed as a simpler alternative, with an RFC draft and proxy implementations bridging JMAP and CalDAV (via tools like Cyrus Server).

2. **Time Zone Challenges**:
   - Debates erupt over handling time zones, DST changes, and recurring events. **fc417fc802** suggests storing timestamps in TAI or UTC, but others argue that local context (e.g., "3 PM Berlin time") is unavoidable and error-prone.  
   - **thqx** and **et1337** stress the practical pitfalls of time zones, like DST shifts causing meetings to misalign, and the need for robust datetime libraries to manage conversions.  
   - **ElectricalUnion** recommends RFC 9557 (IXDTF) to preserve time zone metadata, avoiding data loss during conversions.

3. **Real-World Complexity**:
   - Participants acknowledge that political changes (e.g., Arizona’s DST laws) or last-minute time zone adjustments complicate “perfect” solutions.  
   - **toast0** notes that calendar clients often ignore time zone definitions in iCal files, relying on UTC and hoping for proper display—a fragile approach.  

**Consensus**: While technical workarounds exist, perfect calendar syncing remains elusive due to the interplay of protocol limitations, human-centric scheduling preferences ("3 PM local time"), and unpredictable real-world factors. Developers are urged to leverage datetime libraries and standards like IXDTF while accepting that edge cases will persist.

#### [Submission URL](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/suffering-oriented-programming.html) | 73 points | by [whalesalad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whalesalad) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646601)

In the intriguing world of software engineering, Nathan Marz, the creator of Apache Storm, introduces us to a unique approach called "suffering-oriented programming." This development style, born from Nathan's experience with building Storm—a real-time computation system—suggests that you shouldn't create technology unless you're feeling the acute absence of it. 

The philosophy condenses into a mantra: "First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast." It's a process he outlines through the evolution of Storm, emphasizing a practical progression from understanding immediate needs to refining elegance and eventually optimizing speed and efficiency.

Initially, during the "make it possible" phase, solutions should be straightforward and directly address the problems at hand, no matter how inelegant. This phase involves a raw hacking-out approach that helps you gain insights into the problem's intricacies without over-complicating things prematurely. This phase helped Nathan's team comprehend and address the glaring inefficiencies in their initial stream processing system.

Once a practical solution has been implemented and the problem space is well-mapped, the focus shifts to designing a "beautiful" technology. Here, developers apply deep understanding acquired from the first phase to strip down solutions to their simplest abstractions. This approach avoids overengineering, ensuring the system elegantly handles current use cases without falling prey to the pitfalls of trying to preemptively solve hypothetical future problems.

Finally, by "making it fast," you're optimizing your well-designed solution to enhance performance without sacrificing the foundational elegance and functionality.

Nathan's approach to software development not only led to the creation of Storm but also provides an insightful guideline for tackling big projects effectively by prioritizing necessity, understanding, and eventual refinement. This philosophy not only resonates deeply with many in the tech community but also serves as a powerful tool for risk management and project success in entrepreneurial and startup environments.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Nathan Marz's "suffering-oriented programming" philosophy explores its practical implications, methodologies like TDD, and broader parallels in software development. Key themes include:

1. **Philosophical Debates:**
   - The **"principle of maximum inconvenience"** was highlighted, suggesting intentional discomfort (e.g., tackling hard problems first) can yield better solutions. References to Stoicism ("Marcus Aurelius") and productivity strategies ("Eat the Frog") underscored this idea.
   - A counterpoint warned against overcomplicating tasks, emphasizing the need for **strategic prioritization** over arbitrary hardship.

2. **TDD Controversy:**
   - Developers debated **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Some argued it reduces "suffering" by clarifying assumptions and enabling safer iterations, while others viewed it as restrictive or premature for early-stage projects. Comments reflected tensions between theoretical rigor ("checking boxes") and practical flexibility.

3. **Real-World Applications:**
   - **Nathan Marz's work on Storm and Rama** exemplified the "make it possible, then beautiful" approach. Users detailed how iterating from foundational infrastructure (e.g., solving backend issues at Twitter) to elegant abstractions led to impactful tools, reinforcing the submission’s core thesis.
   - **SaaS development experiences** illustrated balancing rapid iteration with scalability, favoring lightweight business logic over rigid class hierarchies.

4. **Humor and Critique:**
   - Playful terms like **"surfing-oriented programming"** parodied the original concept, while critiques questioned whether *all* suffering is productive. The line between solving genuine pain points and inventing problems was a recurring theme.

5. **Methodological Connections:**
   - Comparisons to **Extreme Programming** emphasized addressing pain points early to drive clean architecture. Others stressed building solutions only when existing alternatives are truly inadequate, avoiding "reinventing the wheel."

**Conclusion:** The discussion reflects a nuanced embrace of Marz’s philosophy—valuing necessity-driven development while cautioning against dogma. TDD debates and real-world examples like Rama highlight the balance between structured discipline and adaptive problem-solving.
