#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/) | 332 points | by [ulrischa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ulrischa) | [259 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43233903)

In a riveting discussion on Simon Willison's Weblog, the complexities and misunderstandings surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding are laid bare. A common grievance among developers using LLMs is the occurrence of "hallucinations," where the model fabricates methods or libraries that aren't real. While this might initially erode trust, Simon argues that these hallucinations are the least harmful type of errors one can encounter. The beauty of coding is that any invented methods are immediately spotlighted by compilers or interpreters, offering a simple fix path: either self-correct or let the LLM iterate on the error.

The real peril lies in errors that don't immediately show up, prompting the need for rigorous testing. Even seemingly flawless code can harbor hidden flaws. The antidote? A robust regimen of manual testing and code review—skills that won't be axed by the rise of LLMs.

For developers inundated with hallucinations, Willison suggests leveraging different models with better-aligned training data, harnessing the full potential of context windows, and choosing established technologies that LLMs are more familiar with.

Simon encourages developers to embrace the LLM learning curve, noting the importance of honing skills in reading and reviewing code efficiently. He also shares how he uses Claude’s “extended thinking mode” for constructive feedback on his work, demonstrating a harmonious blend of AI and human expertise.

This discourse not only mitigates fears surrounding LLM coding errors but also champions a proactive, informed approach to integrating AI into software development. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or an AI novice, there’s food for thought—and skills to sharpen—in this insightful reflection.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges and nuances of integrating LLMs into coding workflows, particularly focusing on code reviews, productivity trade-offs, and broader implications. Key points include:

1. **Code Review Challenges**:  
   - Reviewing LLM-generated code is seen as fundamentally different from human-written code. While human code allows for social/technical knowledge transfer, LLM code lacks "empathy" and contextual decision-making, making reviews feel like negotiating with an opaque system.  
   - Skepticism exists about trusting LLM outputs, especially in unfamiliar domains, as models may generate plausible-looking but incorrect code (e.g., inventing methods or misaligning with project architecture).  

2. **Productivity vs. Maintenance**:  
   - Some users report LLMs boosting productivity (e.g., 20-30% faster coding) but note hidden costs in debugging and maintaining generated code.  
   - Over-reliance on LLMs risks creating codebases that are hard to understand without thorough documentation, tests, and conventions.  

3. **Testing and Constraints**:  
   - Logical flaws in LLM-generated code are harder to catch than syntax errors, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing, static analysis, and design constraints.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to Stack Overflow answers—incorrect solutions can gain traction if not critically reviewed.  

4. **Legal and Cultural Concerns**:  
   - LLMs might deliberately avoid certain outputs (e.g., song lyrics) due to copyright fears, leading to unhelpful or evasive responses.  
   - Debates arise about AI’s role in writing styles, with some arguing AI-assisted editing improves clarity, while others worry it erodes authenticity or cultural nuance.  

5. **Human Expertise Remains Critical**:  
   - Participants stress that understanding design intent, maintaining codebase consistency, and strategic decision-making still require human oversight. Tools like Claude’s "extended thinking mode" are praised for feedback but not replacements for deep comprehension.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects cautious optimism about LLMs as productivity aids but underscores the irreplaceable value of human judgment, thorough testing, and clear documentation. The consensus leans toward using LLMs as tools to augment—not replace—developer expertise.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary: Penrose's Argument on Human Consciousness and Computability**

The discussion critiques Roger Penrose's argument that human consciousness transcends computational explanation, leveraging Gödel's incompleteness theorems. Here's a breakdown of key points:

### **Penrose's Core Argument**
1. **Contradiction via Gödel**: Penrose posits that if human reasoning were algorithmic, Gödel’s theorems would imply a contradiction—humans could detect truths unprovable within any formal system, suggesting non-computability.
2. **Truth Beyond Formal Systems**: He argues that human understanding of "truth" operates at a higher logical level than formal systems, invoking Tarski’s undefinability of truth within the same system.

### **Critiques and Counterarguments**
1. **Relevance of Gödel’s Theorems**:
   - Critics (e.g., **bthlgst**) question whether Gödel’s theorems apply to human cognition. They argue that brains, while finite, might achieve emergent complexity beyond formal systems without violating computational principles.
   - **moi2388** notes Gödel’s theorem cannot be proven within its own system, undermining Penrose’s reliance on self-referential logic.

2. **Physical and Computational Limits**:
   - **Borealid** asserts the brain’s finite particles imply finite computable states. However, rebuttals cite the Bekenstein bound (information limits in physical systems) and the brain’s potential for vast, non-linear interactions.
   - **bbblywrld** highlights practical limits: even if the universe is finite, simulating a brain’s quantum or statistical mechanics might be intractable with current models.

3. **Busy Beaver Problem**:
   - Some argue Busy Beaver numbers (non-computable for large \(n\)) illustrate computational limits. However, others note Turing machines with finite resources can’t compute these, and human brains—also finite—may face similar constraints.
   - **jklzrff** points out that even small Turing machines (e.g., 800 states) can challenge formal systems like ZFC, suggesting fundamental unpredictability.

4. **Emergence and Complexity**:
   - **slfmschf** and **vrydyhstlng** propose consciousness as an emergent phenomenon from complex neural networks, potentially irreducible to algorithms. They compare brain activity to chaotic systems with measurable outputs but inherently unpredictable internal states.

### **Skepticism Toward Penrose**
- Most participants reject Penrose’s conclusion. Critics argue:
  - **Formal Systems vs. Reality**: Gödel’s theorems apply to abstract systems, not necessarily physical brains.
  - **Finite but Complex**: The brain’s finite structure doesn’t preclude hyper-complex, non-algorithmic behavior.
  - **Undefined Concepts**: "Truth" and "consciousness" are too nebulous to anchor Penrose’s argument.

### **Conclusion**
The discussion underscores skepticism about linking Gödel’s theorems to consciousness. While Penrose’s ideas provoke debate, critics emphasize the gap between abstract logic and biological cognition, advocating for empirical neuroscience over philosophical arguments. The Busy Beaver problem and physical limits of computation serve as focal points, but no consensus emerges on whether brains transcend computability.

In an intriguing push forward in the realm of conversational AI, Brendan Iribe, Ankit Kumar, and the Sesame research team are zeroing in on what they dub "voice presence"—the art of making digital interactions feel genuinely human. While digital assistants often respond with monotonous tones, Sesame aims to infuse voices with emotional intelligence and contextual awareness, rendering these virtual interlocutors engaging and dynamic partners in conversation.

To bridge this gap, Sesame employs a new Conversational Speech Model (CSM), which dives into the nuances of communication—capturing rhythm, tone, and the historical context of conversations with the help of transformers. This sophisticated setup aims to resolve the prevalent issue where traditional text-to-speech models produce audio that lacks the richness found in natural human interactions.

Their approach involves transforming continuous audio waveforms into discrete semantic and acoustic tokens. These tokens work hand-in-hand to encapsulate a speaker's unique timbre and the finer acoustic details needed for producing high-fidelity, lifelike speech. Yet, the team acknowledges challenges, particularly with maintaining a smooth integration of prosody in semantic tokens and managing the timing hiccups inherent in RVQ-based systems.

Though still refining their techniques, Sesame has launched a demo showcasing some of their progress in creating these expressive, friendly AI companions. Users are encouraged to try out this engaging new approach with a browser recommendation of using Chrome for the best audio experience—evidence of their focused drive to cross the uncanny valley in conversational AI.

   - The model’s architecture (8B backbone + 3B decoder) and open-source Apache 2.0 license are noted as exciting technical strides.

2. **Comparisons & Competition**:  
   - Comparisons are drawn to OpenAI’s voice models and Google’s Gemini 20, with debates about whether Sesame’s responsiveness and personality outpace existing tools. Some criticize Google’s voice synthesis as overly monotonic or "fake" in demos like Duplex.

3. **Ethical & Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism arises about emotional attachment to human-like AI voices, with fears of manipulation, privacy breaches, and dependency. Critics argue that overly "friendly" voices risk blurring boundaries, potentially exploiting users or enabling scams.  
   - Data policies (e.g., recordings stored for 30 days) are questioned, with calls for transparency.

4. **Critiques of Voice Personality**:  
   - Some find the demo’s voice overly enthusiastic ("Northern Californian CEO" energy) or "synthetic bubbly," which feels inauthentic or off-putting. Others humorously reference dystopian pop culture (e.g., *Hitchhiker’s Guide*’s depressed robots) to highlight the uncanny valley of hyper-cheerful AI.

5. **Cultural & Practical Nuances**:  
   - Requests for accent personalization (e.g., Australian) emerge, alongside jokes about Knight Rider-style customization. A divide surfaces between users who prefer neutral, utilitarian assistants and those excited by emotionally intelligent interfaces.

6. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Comments acknowledge hurdles like prosody integration, latency in RVQ-based systems, and the computational cost of real-time processing. The team’s focus on "voice presence" over raw accuracy is debated as either visionary or impractical.

**Overall**: While Sesame’s demo impresses with its conversational fluency, the discussion underscores broader tensions in AI development—balancing innovation with ethical design, human connection with privacy, and personality with authenticity.

### Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/) | 17 points | by [OuterVale](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=OuterVale) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43227972)

Simon Willison's latest blog post dives deep into the world of hallucinations in code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs). Contrary to what many developers might fear, Willison argues that hallucinations in code are the least perilous mistakes these models can make. He explains that when LLMs invent non-existent methods or libraries, these errors are glaringly obvious the moment you try to compile the code. Unlike prose, where factual inaccuracies can slip through undetected and harm credibility, code offers an immediate form of fact-checking: just run it.

Willison points out that more significant risks lurk in subtle logic errors that a compiler won't catch. These can go unnoticed if developers do not thoroughly test their code. He adds that gaining proficiency with LLMs requires dedication and practice; it’s not uncommon for beginners to dismiss these tools at the first sign of trouble. Critics, he suggests, often haven't invested the time needed to understand how to effectively leverage LLM technology.

To minimize hallucinations, Willison shares practical tips: experimenting with different models, providing ample context, and avoiding overly new libraries are just a few strategies. Moreover, he emphasizes the vital role of manual code review—not only to catch mistakes but also as an essential skill for all software professionals. Reviewing LLM-generated code isn't just necessary; it's a fantastic opportunity to hone one's skills. 

In closing, Willison addresses the common complaint that code review is too time-consuming by highlighting its value for personal skill development. Encouraging developers to embrace code review, he paints it as a critical pillar of the modern programming landscape.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the role of human expertise versus LLMs in code review and development, sparked by Simon Willison’s blog post on LLM code hallucinations. Here’s a concise summary of the debate:

1. **Human Expertise vs. LLM Limitations**:  
   Participants argue that human code reviewers bring irreplaceable qualities like contextual understanding, familiarity with a team’s coding style, and awareness of reputation/trust in coworkers. Unlike LLMs, humans can infer intent and assess code quality holistically, which is critical for maintaining standards. Critics of LLMs note they lack these traits, often producing code that may "hallucinate" solutions without grasping deeper logic or project-specific nuances.

2. **Code Review as Skill Development**:  
   A key point emphasized is that manual code review is not just error-checking but a vital skill-building exercise. Reviewing others’ code—human or machine-generated—helps developers learn problem-solving, understand new approaches, and improve their own coding practices. Skeptics counter that reading code alone (e.g., LLM-generated snippets) doesn’t equate to true understanding, likening it to passively reading textbook answers without solving problems independently.

3. **Speed vs. Quality Trade-offs**:  
   While LLMs can generate code quickly, participants caution against prioritizing speed over quality. Human reviewers are seen as essential for catching subtle logic errors and ensuring maintainability, especially in collaborative environments. Anonymous LLM contributions were flagged as riskier than code from trusted colleagues, as trust and accountability matter in team settings.

4. **Motivation and Learning**:  
   The discussion highlights that code review fosters motivation and growth for developers, encouraging deeper engagement with codebases. Critics of over-reliance on LLMs argue that skipping review processes stifles learning opportunities and risks embedding undetected flaws.  

In essence, the consensus leans toward human reviewers remaining indispensable for context, quality, and skill development, even as LLMs offer speed benefits. The debate underscores the need for balance: leveraging LLMs pragmatically while maintaining rigorous human oversight.
