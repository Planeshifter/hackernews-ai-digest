### LAION, a high school teacher’s free image database, powers AI unicorns

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-24/a-high-school-teacher-s-free-image-database-powers-ai-unicorns) | 315 points | by [RafelMri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RafelMri) | [172 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35685497)

The article tells the story of Christoph Schuhmann, a high school teacher who created LAION, the world's largest free AI training data set. LAION collects images and captions from various websites and uses them to train text-to-image generators, such as Google's Imagen and Stability AI's Stable Diffusion. The article explores the legal and ethical issues that arise from using publicly available materials for AI purposes, such as copyright infringement, bias, and regulation. The article also presents Schuhmann's views on why he wants to keep LAION open-source and independent.

Some users argue that LAION  only indexes internet lists of URLs, regional messages, and AI-generated text-to-image models, and does not publish any copyrighted content. Other users point out the potential legal liabilities and suggest that Common Crawl, a California nonprofit, should curate the collected visual data. Additionally, the comments touch on the challenges of accessibility in the design of captchas, the importance of properly organized high-quality imagery, and the legal implications of using scraped visual data for machine learning.

### Google Authenticator now supports Google Account synchronization

#### [Submission URL](https://security.googleblog.com/2023/04/google-authenticator-now-supports.html) | 429 points | by [ortusdux](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ortusdux) | [305 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35690398)

Google Authenticator, a popular two-factor authentication app, now supports synchronization with Google Accounts. This means that users can easily transfer their authentication codes to a new device without needing to manually re-enter them. The feature is available on Android and iOS devices and uses Google Cloud to securely store and transfer the data. This upgrade provides added convenience and security for users who rely on two-factor authentication to protect their accounts.

Some users have complained about Google's 2FA offerings, including mismatched numbers and issues with Google Prompts not working on certain devices. Others have suggested potential solutions, such as using U2F tokens, while acknowledging the importance of account recovery processes involving important documents. The discussion also touches on related topics, such as password management, customer support, and device limitations. Overall, the consensus seems to be that while there are some issues and complexities with the technology, 2FA remains an important security measure that consumers should take advantage of.

### ONNX Runtime merges WebGPU backend

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime/pull/14579) | 166 points | by [b_mc2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=b_mc2) | [31 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35694553)

Microsoft's open-source AI platform, ONNX Runtime, has introduced a WebGPU backend to accelerate machine learning models on the web. The JavaScript Execution Provider (JSEP) enables asynchronous inferencing execution and includes both C/C++ and TypeScript/JavaScript implementations. JSEP uses Emscripten's Asyncify compiler feature to unwind and rewind the call stack to emulate async execution. WebGPU is designed to have stronger features than WebGL, the other API currently available for accessing a GPU from a browser, making it a better solution for GPU performance when inferencing machine learning models.

Yhe submission sparked a discussion about the ONNX format, ONNX Runtime, and the implementation of the WebGPU backend for ML models. Some commenters suggested that the ONNX format is one of the best performing ML runtimes currently available, while others noted the lack of documentation for different platforms and hardware combinations. Others praised Microsoft's ONNX and made comparisons between different compiler systems. Some suggested alternative approaches to commenting and merging code to larger PRs. There was also discussion about the usefulness of the ONNX library, with some saying it worked well for them, and others suggesting that it could still use some improvement.

### 1Password to Add Telemetry 

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.1password.com/privacy-preserving-app-telemetry/) | 285 points | by [zan5hin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zan5hin) | [266 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35691383)

1Password, the password manager service, has begun an internal test of a new in-app telemetry system with a view to better understanding how users interact with the product. The initiative will be voluntary for employees and will not involve any data from customer accounts. Over the years, 1Password has regularly used its customer research programme to inform product development, but the company said it needed to expand its knowledge to improve the service for the millions of people using the product. Results from the internal trial will be evaluated before plans for a rollout are confirmed.

A user commented that they have been using the password manager Keepass, as they prefer a local vault and do not want any browser or cloud-based password managers. Another user praised 1Password's UI/UX, while others expressed concerns about the voluntary telemetry initiative and subscription-based licensing. Some users recommended Bitwarden and Keepass as alternatives with better functionalities. Some users also expressed skepticism about the benefits of telemetry and the need for it.

### Snapchat sees spike in 1-star reviews as users pan the ‘My AI’ feature

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2023/04/24/snapchat-sees-spike-in-1-star-reviews-as-users-pan-the-my-ai-feature-calling-for-its-removal/) | 240 points | by [mmq](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mmq) | [200 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35689596)

Snapchat's new AI chatbot, powered by OpenAI's GPT technology, has been met with criticism by users following its recent public release. The chatbot, which is now pinned at the top of Snapchat's Chat tab, has resulted in a spike of negative reviews on the US App Store, with 75% being one-star reviews over the past week. Many users feel the chatbot is invasive and creepy, with concerns surrounding the collection of personal data, and have called for it to be a voluntary, opt-in feature. Some reviews indicate that even those who rated the app five stars have complaints about the My AI feature.

The comments section discusses data privacy concerns and the collection of personal data by companies, as well as the implementation of taxes like the Canadian Manufacturers Tax and GST. Some users feel that people do not grasp the extent of data collection that is happening, and that companies need to be more transparent about it. Others point out that sharing of personal information is an expected part of using such services.
