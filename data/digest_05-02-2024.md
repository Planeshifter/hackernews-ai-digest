### Real-time AI using scalable non-expert crowdsourcing in colorectal surgery

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01095-8) | 20 points | by [zachwdc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zachwdc) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40237883)

A new study published on nature.com discusses the use of real-time near-infrared artificial intelligence in colorectal surgery, aiming to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes. The research demonstrates a method to gather surgical tissue annotations through crowdsourcing of non-experts, allowing for the training and deployment of an accurate AI model for surgical anatomy recognition. This innovative approach could potentially reduce complications like anastomotic leaks in bowel surgery.

The study utilized a gamified crowdsourcing platform to obtain annotated training data from 95 colorectal procedures, saving significant expert hours that would have been required for annotation. The crowdsourced annotations were used to train a soft tissue segmentation AI model called Bowel.CSS, which accurately segmented bowel and abdominal wall tissues in real-time. The primary endpoints of the study included assessing the expertise level of the crowdsource workers, expert hours saved, accuracy of the crowdsource annotations compared to expert annotations, and the accuracy of the Bowel.CSS model predictions against expert annotations.

This groundbreaking research showcases the potential of utilizing non-expert crowdsourcing to advance surgical artificial intelligence and improve surgical outcomes.

The discussion on this submission seems to be quite unusual and not directly related to the content of the study. Comments include mentions of "grph prbblty stry gghx ttl fnctn nmbr ttl wrds rd rmrkbl" by user karma_pharmer, a comparison to Foldit in surgery games by user zchthwf, and a mention of "SphincterIt" by karma_pharmer. User HumanOstrich simply says "Gross," and TraumaLlama adds "dd." Overall, the discussion appears to be more on the playful or random side rather than focusing on the actual content of the study.
