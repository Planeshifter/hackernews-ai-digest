There's a popular cautionary tale in artificial intelligence about researchers training a neural network to detect tanks in photographs, only to realize it had learned something useless like time of day. The story is often cited to warn against the limits of algorithms and dataset bias but has never been properly sourced. Some researchers believe it's an urban legend, likely with an origin in a speculative question in the 1960s about early neural network research. While dataset bias is real, the story gives a misleading indication of risks from deep learning and should be replaced with real examples to focus on larger-scale risks.

The cautionary tale about a neural network trained to detect tanks in photographs that ended up identifying time of day is believed to be an urban legend by researchers who argue that it gives a misleading indication of the risks of deep learning. They advocate for a focus on larger-scale risks with real examples instead of relying on this allegory. The discussion features anecdotal retellings of similar urban legends about AI and machine learning, including an allegedly true story from a college professor about a shadow detection neural net and a dog-based attempt to take down tanks. Additionally, some commenters note the lack of credible primary sources for the military project that the infamous tank story is usually attributed to.

### Giving LLM’s a <Backspace> Token

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05426) | 76 points | by [bilsbie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bilsbie) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36425375)

Researchers Chris Cundy and Stefano Ermon have developed a new method called SequenceMatch for autoregressive sequence modeling with backtracking. Unlike the traditional maximum-likelihood objective method, SequenceMatch involves imitation learning (IL), allowing for a variety of divergences between the generated and dataset sequences, including those generated out of distribution. The model can also incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. SequenceMatch training has shown improvements in text generation over MLE on language models. The paper outlines the SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models.

### How RLHF Works

#### [Submission URL](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/how-rlhf-works) | 159 points | by [natolambert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=natolambert) | [31 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36418807)

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) works when two conditions are met, according to Nathan Lambert, who says there needs to be some signal showing that applying vanilla supervised learning only does not work and a complex optimization landscape that needs to slowly change over time to achieve success. The setup, however, is hard and Lambert explains it using the example of generating chat agents that are both helpful and not spewing toxic statements, which requires a capable language large model to follow instructions and applying a combination of fine-tunings and systems engineering for the harm reduction half. Data practices that can tank model performance, such as imitating models and using imperfect datasets, should also be avoided.

The submission is about reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and how it works only under specific conditions, as explained by Nathan Lambert.
