### The Dutch government wants automatic permission to target victims of hackers

#### [Submission URL](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/dutch-intel-law-about-intel/) | 267 points | by [croes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=croes) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36281543)

The Dutch government is proposing a new law that would significantly increase the scope of its intelligence and security services act. One specific element of the new law is the automatic extension of warrants to hacking victims, or "non-targets." Under the new law, the criteria for targeting non-targets becomes more lenient than for targeting actual targets. The new law also allows for an administrative addition, which involves no further approval process, to enlarge a warrant to target internet subscriptions or devices from entirely unrelated individuals, which creates the fiction that the original target extends to random other people. Some experts are questioning whether this new law is in line with recent jurisprudence, particularly with regards to Article 8 ECHR.

The Dutch government is proposing a new law that would increase the scope of its intelligence and security services act, including allowing the automatic extension of warrants to hacking victims. However, some commentators are questioning the law's compatibility with recent jurisprudence surrounding Article 8 ECHR and privacy rights. Other comments include discussion of the GDPR and domestic intelligence agencies, while some question whether the legislation will lead to a loss of transparency, and one commenter notes that some things are just too difficult to legislate effectively.

### Treebomination: Convert a scikit-learn decision tree into a Keras model

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Dobiasd/treebomination) | 75 points | by [Dobiasd](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Dobiasd) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36282748)

Treebomination is a new tool that can help convert scikit-learn decision trees into TensorFlow Keras models. Though not necessarily useful for real-time data analysis, this tool could be a fun experiment for those wanting to prove a point about neural networks or converting decision trees into something new. Treebomination creates a similar network to the original tree by deriving the network structure, initializing the weights and biases, and simulating the decision nodes in the tree. It creates an almost exact prediction as the original tree does and could be a useful tool for those wanting to play around with decision trees and neural networks.

The discussion in the comments primarily focuses on the technical details of converting decision trees into TensorFlow Keras models. Some users, such as "pnsndwch," point out that Treebomination may not be very useful for real-time data analysis but could be an interesting experiment for converting decision trees into something new. "Dobiasd" responds, noting that while Treebomination may be limited in its abilities, the tool's ability to simulate decision nodes in the tree and create an almost exact prediction as the original tree does make it a useful tool for playing around with decision trees and neural networks. 

Other users, such as "syntxng," discuss the differences between Treebomination and the decision forests in TensorFlow. "Dobiasd" agrees with this point, saying that Treebomination using TF-DF would make more sense. Finally, "thangngoc89" shares a link to Hummingbird 1.1, which "Dobiasd" finds interesting for its ability to compile TensorFlow computations cleverly for nested decision trees.

### Show HN: Java REST without annotations, DI nor reactive streams

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/MartinGeisse/grumpyrest) | 136 points | by [moring](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moring) | [115 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36283351)

Grumpyrest is a new Java REST server framework that circumvents the use of annotations, automatic dependency injection, and reactive streams and instead leverages the Java type system, threads, and virtual threads for maximum parallelism. Unlike most REST frameworks, endpoint mounting is not accomplished through annotation, and accessing request properties doesn't involve declaring handler parameters. Validation for expected request data is performed against the Java type system, which in turn establishes JSON mappings for request and response objects. While the framework may introduce internal mechanisms to address performance concerns, it remains committed to ensuring that Java developers avoid such mechanisms in their application code.

The submission discusses a new Java REST server framework called Grumpyrest. It circumvents the use of annotations and automatic dependency injection, instead leveraging the Java type system and threads for maximum parallelism. It offers a novel approach to endpoint mounting and validation. The comments discuss the pros and cons of using annotations and the difficulties with integration with existing frameworks such as Spring. Some express concerns about the complexity and difficulty of using a type system-based approach, while others argue that it makes development easier in the long run. The discussion raises concerns about the difficulty of testing and the need to mock request cycles, but the author promises to address these issues in future versions. Overall, there is interest in the new framework, but some skepticism about its usability and practicality.

Applying for fast food jobs using AI chatbots and automated processes can be frustrating and ineffective, according to Amanda Claypool, who applied for and landed a job at Waffle House. Claypool described her unsuccessful experiences applying to McDonald's, Wendy's, Crumbl Cookies, and Hardee's. McDonald's chatbot did not schedule an interview for her, while the Wendy's chatbot scheduled for the wrong shift time and the hiring manager never followed up after the interview. The Crumbl Cookies application required multiple steps, including a video cover letter. Claypool stated that AI chatbots may provide efficiency in the hiring process, but it can also leave applicants feeling annoyed and uncertain.

The submission talks about the frustrating and often unproductive experience that job seekers face while applying for fast food jobs through AI chatbots and automated processes. Some users commented that local stores and fast-food places have often had failed hiring processes due to understaffing and other issues. Others pointed out that the use of AI chatbots sometimes leads to discrimination, misuse, and frustration among applicants. Some users felt that the application process is often unfair and puts job seekers at a disadvantage. A few users suggested that referrals and videos, including symmetric video interviews, could be useful in the hiring process to identify candidates' qualities. Some users discussed the use of AI in different hiring processes, and others criticized the use of AI and how it shapes the way recruitment is done.

### Carrington event of 1859 disrupted telegraph lines. Miyake event would be worse

#### [Submission URL](https://bigthink.com/hard-science/miyake-event-worse-carrington-event/) | 42 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36284049)

In 1859, a solar flare caused the Carrington event, which disrupted telegraph lines. However, research into tree rings has revealed "Miyake events," which indicate cosmic events that are much more powerful than the Carrington event. Miyake events leave sudden, single-year jumps in the concentration of carbon-14, meaning that they are useful for dating the past. However, if a Miyake event were to occur today, it would severely disrupt modern life. Scientists have detected Miyake events in 774-775 AD, 7176 BC, 5410 BC, 5259 BC, 993 AD, and 774 AD, with intense surges of carbon-14, beryllium-10, and chlorine-36.

The discussion of this submission focuses on the potential impact of a Miyake event on modern life. Some commenters point out that, compared to the Carrington event, a Miyake event would have much more severe consequences on our technology-dependent society. Others argue that the damage from a Miyake event may not be as significant, since power plants and other critical infrastructure could be quickly shut down to prevent widespread damage. However, it is noted that even a temporary loss of power could have serious and lasting consequences. Additionally, some commenters raise concerns about the potential for an EMP or nuclear bomb to cause similar disruptions to our infrastructure. Overall, the discussion highlights the importance of preparing for and mitigating the potential impact of such events.

### Let's make PostgreSQL multi-threaded

#### [Submission URL](https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/31cc6df9-53fe-3cd9-af5b-ac0d801163f4%40iki.fi) | 43 points | by [Icathian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Icathian) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36284487)

Heikki Linnakangas proposes making PostgreSQL multi-threaded, with the whole server running in a single process, with multiple threads. There is a consensus that it would be a good thing, with no major objections. However, there are many hurdles to overcome, such as the transition period, global variables, and thread-safe libraries. The proposal suggests having one thread per connection, with the ability to spawn additional helper threads for specific tasks. Extensions will need to be labeled as supporting multi-threading or requiring a multi-threaded server, with new flags added to the control file. The exposed backend process PIDs will need to be replaced, and signals rewritten with some other signalling mechanism in multi-threaded mode. If a backend process crashes, a separate postmaster process can monitor and restart it on crash. There will also be a need to switch to thread-safe versions of library functions and to check the compatibility of other libraries used.
