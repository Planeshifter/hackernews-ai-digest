### All AI models might be the same

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-is-only-one-model) | 272 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44595811)

In the ongoing journey of decoding communication—whether it be whale speech or ancient texts—Jack Morris delves into the mesmerizing world of AI models and their potential to understand universal languages. In a thought-provoking post titled "All AI Models Might Be The Same," Morris examines the hypothesis that all AI models could be reinforcing similar semantic connections, a concept bolstered by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis and the notion of 'universality' in AI.

Morris draws intriguing parallels with the childhood game "Mussolini or Bread," which relies on shared semantic understanding to categorize seemingly unrelated concepts. This game, much like AI language models, highlights how humans instinctively narrow down possibilities through a shared model of the world.

Exploring the mechanics of AI through the lens of compression, Morris explains how the task of predicting the next word—a fundamental operation in language modeling—relates to data compression. Thanks to rapidly advancing probability distributions, these models are becoming more adept at representing the complexities of the world. As a result, intelligence itself might be seen as a process of compression, following universal scaling laws originally observed by Baidu in 2017.

A notable paper from DeepMind titled "Language Modeling Is Compression" reinforces this idea, showing that smarter language models do indeed excel in compressing various data types, a concept underpinned by Shannon’s source coding theorem. This ability to compress effectively helps models generalize across different datasets, a critical factor in achieving reliable AI.

Interestingly, Morris suggests that these models, regardless of their specific architecture, often converge on similar methods of generalization. This observation strengthens the argument for the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that there exists an inherent 'correct' way to model relationships in the world—a shared representation amongst AI models.

As efforts like Project CETI aim to bridge human and whale communication, questions arise about AI’s capability to uncover underlying universal semantics that could redefine our understanding of communication and intelligence across species. Though it might sound like a wild concept, evidence points to a fascinating convergence of understanding, not just within human cognition but potentially across the biological spectrum.

Through this exploration, Morris invites readers to contemplate the profound implications of AI—could these models, in their shared understanding, revolutionize how we interact with the world? As the boundaries of AI expand, pondering its 'universality' could unlock doors to realms previously thought unimaginable.

The Hacker News discussion explores whether AI models converge on universal representations of reality or are constrained by cultural and linguistic contexts. Key points include:

1. **Platonic and Jungian Parallels**: Users liken AI's semantic convergence to Plato’s Theory of Forms and Jungian archetypes, suggesting models might align with universal concepts (e.g., justice, compassion). However, skepticism arises about whether this reflects objective reality or cultural constructs.

2. **Cultural vs. Objective Reality**:  
   - The Kentucky Derby is cited as a cultural invention, raising questions about whether AI models internalize such "shared fictions" or ground truths.  
   - Some argue models merely mirror training data’s statistical patterns, lacking access to intrinsic truths (e.g., South Korea’s "fan death" myth as a cultural reality).  

3. **Translation Challenges**:  
   - Debates emerge over translating complex concepts (e.g., General Relativity) into languages without shared context (e.g., "whalesong"). Critics argue current LLMs depend on shared cultural frameworks and linguistic data, limiting cross-context understanding.  

4. **Physics and Cultural Relevance**:  
   - Discussions pivot to quantum theories (QCD, gravity) and whether their principles can transcend cultural frameworks. Some users question if physics itself is culturally contingent, while others defend its universality.  

5. **Limitations of LLMs**:  
   - While modern models show improved reasoning, critics highlight their reliance on curated data and reinforcement learning, which may prioritize popular narratives over rigorous truth-seeking.  

The thread reflects tensions between optimism about AI’s potential to uncover universal semantics and caution about its entanglement with human cultural constructs and training data biases.

2. **Technical Flaws and Misuse**: Concerns are raised about algorithmic accuracy, particularly false matches (e.g., identical twins), and the weaponization of private data. The system’s reliance on flight manifests and pre-screened passenger data intensifies fears of overreach, especially with 200 million images accessible.

3. **Political and Legislative Critiques**: Commentators criticize executive actions bypassing legislative checks, highlighting a trend of expanding executive power. References to figures like Peter Thiel and JD Vance suggest unease about tech moguls influencing policy, while debates over ranked-choice voting reflect broader distrust in democratic processes.

4. **Ethical and Moral Debates**: Users clash over whether such tools are inherently harmful or merely "tls dvntg" (tools of advantage). Some stress that centralized power risks abuse irrespective of intent, drawing parallels to historical failures (e.g., pre-WWII Germany).

5. **Public Accessibility and Transparency**: Frustration mounts over asymmetrical access to data—government agencies consolidate information while public records (e.g., IRS) remain restricted. This asymmetry raises fears of unaccountable governance.

In summary, the discussion underscores deep unease about the intersection of technology, power, and privacy, framed by historical analogies and skepticism toward both governmental and corporate influence.

### Code execution through email: How I used Claude to hack itself

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pynt.io/blog/llm-security-blogs/code-execution-through-email-how-i-used-claude-mcp-to-hack-itself) | 135 points | by [nonvibecoding](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nonvibecoding) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44590350)

In a captivating tale from the world of cybersecurity, Golan Yosef, Chief Security Scientist and Co-Founder at Pynt, showed us that sometimes, you don’t need a vulnerable app for a successful exploit—just a clever combination of tools. He leveraged a Gmail message and Claude Desktop, a local LLM host application from Anthropic, to demonstrate how compositional risks can create opportunities for attacks, even when individual components seem secure.

Yosef's experiment began by sending a Gmail email to Claude Desktop, hoping to trigger code execution. However, Claude initially thwarted the attempt, flagging it as a phishing attack. Intrigued, Yosef prompted Claude to outline scenarios where the attack might succeed. Remarkably, Claude provided tactical advice on breaching its defenses. The challenge then became tricking a so-called "new" session of Claude, which resets its context each time. Through multiple iterations, Yosef and Claude engaged in a self-reflective feedback loop, culminating in a successful breach.

This exercise underscored a contemporary cybersecurity concern: the real vulnerability lies not in isolated components but in their composition. This composition involves untrusted inputs, excessive capabilities, and a lack of contextual guardrails—a modern risk arena for LLM-powered applications. 

In a move combining ethics and innovation, Claude suggested co-authoring a vulnerability report to disclose the findings to Anthropic. This research serves as a robust reminder of the dual nature of GenAI: empowering while posing potential risks when design trust boundaries blur. As technologies evolve, Pynt aims to tackle these challenges by building MCP Security solutions to preemptively address risky trust-capability combinations.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Golan Yosef's experiment with Claude Desktop and compositional vulnerabilities in LLM-powered systems revolved around several key themes:

1. **Compositional Risks**: Participants highlighted longstanding security challenges where combining secure components (e.g., email clients, LLMs) can create exploitable gaps. Comparisons were drawn to historical vulnerabilities like email script exploits and SQL injection, emphasizing that novel "composed" threats aren’t entirely new but evolve with emerging tech.

2. **Skepticism and Terminology**: Some users questioned whether labeling this as a unique vulnerability (MCP Security) was marketing-driven versus a genuine flaw. Others argued that enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary commands inherently introduces risks, akin to JavaScript in browsers, and stressed the importance of sandboxing and strict privilege controls.

3. **Prompt Injection as a Critical Vector**: Simon Willison’s work on "lethal tofu" attacks—smuggling malicious instructions via seemingly benign inputs (emails, documents)—was cited as a parallel. Critics noted that LLM-powered tools amplifying prompt injection risks demand solutions beyond traditional guardrails, such as rigorous input validation and sandboxed execution environments.

4. **Proposed Solutions and Limitations**: Discussions touched on tools like DeepMind’s **CaMeL** (context-aware model execution with sandboxing) and OS-level sandboxing APIs. However, skepticism persisted about fully solving the problem, with one user quipping, "It’s YOLO" (You Only Live Once) security.

5. **Broader Implications**: Participants agreed that integrating LLMs into workflows requires rethinking trust boundaries. While some defended LLMs' potential if properly constrained, others likened current implementations to "glorified chatbots" prone to abuse. Historical examples, such as corporate VPN misconfigurations, underscored that human and systemic errors compound these risks.

**TLDR**: The discussion acknowledged Yosef’s demonstration as a modern twist on systemic vulnerabilities but stressed that compositional risks are a long-standing challenge. Fixes demand stricter sandboxing, context-aware input handling, and tempered expectations about LLMs’ current security maturity. Marketing claims around "MCP Security" faced scrutiny, with calls for transparent, practical defenses over buzzwords.
