### Cargo Cult AI

#### [Submission URL](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3595860) | 117 points | by [rmwdev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rmwdev) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991362)

In a thought-provoking article, physicist Edlyn V. Levine explores the idea of whether or not the ability to think scientifically is the defining essence of intelligence. Levine looks at the phenomenon of "cargo cult science," where humans believe in fallacies based on a lack of rigorous investigation. She also examines the dominance of neural nets in today's AI and questions whether this approach is ultimately sustainable or capable of achieving AGI capable of scientific reasoning. Levine suggests that new algorithmic paradigms may be necessary for AI to truly emulate scientific thinking and achieve AGI.

Physicist Edlyn V. Levine's article questioning whether thinking scientifically is the essence of intelligence prompted a discussion on Hacker News. Some commenters pointed out that the limitations of machine learning models make it impossible for AI to be on par with human intelligence, while others argued that GPT-4, a language AI model, has made significant improvements in multitasking, larger context access, and prompt response. Some expressed skepticism about AI's planning ability and criticized the pop culture trend of anthropomorphizing AI. Others argued that language models are crucial to the development of general intelligence and that AI should focus on understanding latent structures and signal inference for natural language processing. Finally, some commenters suggested that comparing human intelligence and AI's capabilities is redundant and that machine learning has its own unique strengths that can address specific problems.

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized) | 254 points | by [yenniejun111](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yenniejun111) | [167 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35983707)

Language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT rely on tokenization to generate and process text, but the process of tokenization is not uniform across all languages, resulting in disparities in the number of tokens required to represent the same expression in different languages. A recent analysis of parallel datasets of short messages translated into 52 different languages found that some languages, such as Armenian and Burmese, require up to 10 times more tokens than English to tokenize comparable messages. This has implications for the cost and efficiency of language models in different languages.

The submission discusses the issue of tokenization in language models and how some languages require more tokens to represent the same expression, resulting in efficiency and cost issues for language models in different languages. In the discussion, some users stray from the main topic and offer tangential remarks about issues such as Medium's partnership expenses, substack's financial struggles, and the intricacies of different writing systems such as Morse code and Hangul. However, there are also some interesting comments related to the main topic, including a comparison of tokenization in different Asian languages, the impact of phonetic transcription on Chinese script, and the limitations of language and pronunciation for expressing meaning in different languages.

### The Great CPU Stagnation

#### [Submission URL](http://databasearchitects.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-great-cpu-stagnation.html) | 242 points | by [greghn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=greghn) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35989462)

For decades, Moore's Law led to exponential growth in the number of transistors in CPUs, while Dennard scaling enabled higher clock frequencies. However, Dennard scaling began to falter around 2005, and clock frequencies have plateaued since then. As a result, the additional available transistors have been channeled into creating more cores per chip, leading to an era of CPU stagnation. Despite improved production nodes, the cost-adjusted figures reveal that the exponential improvement in CPU speed has come to a halt. Consequently, most software is extremely inefficient when compared to the hardware's potential, implying that maybe custom chips will have a more significant role in the future.

This submission discusses how the exponential growth in CPU speed due to Moore's Law and Dennard scaling has hit a plateau due to stagnation. Although improved production nodes have been developed, the additional available transistors have been channelled into creating more cores per chip, leading to an era of CPU stagnation. The comments section discusses the use of benchmarks to measure CPU performance, but there is a debate regarding which benchmarks are reliable. Some users suggest that CPU performance results are relative, while others recommend using specific benchmarks. There are also discussions on the use of outdated hardware for development and the potential benefits of using slower hardware for optimization purposes. Other topics include the use of custom chips and the advancement of mobile computing.

### FCC rejects Dish 5G plan that could have made Starlink broadband “unusable”

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/fcc-saves-starlink-from-5g-interference-backing-spacex-in-fight-against-dish/) | 16 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35994639)

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has ruled in favor of Starlink by rejecting a proposal from Dish Network that could degrade internet service for Starlink's satellite users. Dish wanted to authorize high-powered terrestrial mobile services in the 12.2-12.7 GHz band that is already used by Starlink customer terminals for downloads. FCC ruled not to permit this, but it said it would investigate the potential to expand terrestrial fixed use or permit unlicensed use in that spectrum. The 12.2-12.7 GHz band is also used for satellite TV, and the FCC's decision "ensures the present and future of satellite services in this band," said FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel.

The discussion in the comments revolves around the potential interference between Starlink's satellite service and existing terrestrial mobile services in the same frequency band. Some users wonder why the FCC would authorize terrestrial mobile services in the same orbit as Starlink's synchronous satellites, which are located at a much higher altitude than traditional geostationary satellites. Others argue that the proposal from Dish Network would have caused interference with existing satellite TV customers, which the FCC's ruling has also helped protect.
