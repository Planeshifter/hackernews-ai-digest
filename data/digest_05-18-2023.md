#### [Submission URL](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?ref=rss&id=3595860) | 117 points | by [rmwdev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rmwdev) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35991362)

In a thought-provoking article, physicist Edlyn V. Levine explores the idea of whether or not the ability to think scientifically is the defining essence of intelligence. Levine looks at the phenomenon of "cargo cult science," where humans believe in fallacies based on a lack of rigorous investigation. She also examines the dominance of neural nets in today's AI and questions whether this approach is ultimately sustainable or capable of achieving AGI capable of scientific reasoning. Levine suggests that new algorithmic paradigms may be necessary for AI to truly emulate scientific thinking and achieve AGI.

Some commenters pointed out that the limitations of machine learning models make it impossible for AI to be on par with human intelligence, while others argued that GPT-4, a language AI model, has made significant improvements in multitasking, larger context access, and prompt response. Some expressed skepticism about AI's planning ability and criticized the pop culture trend of anthropomorphizing AI. Others argued that language models are crucial to the development of general intelligence and that AI should focus on understanding latent structures and signal inference for natural language processing. Finally, some commenters suggested that comparing human intelligence and AI's capabilities is redundant and that machine learning has its own unique strengths that can address specific problems.

### Language models cost much more in some languages than others

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.yenniejun.com/p/all-languages-are-not-created-tokenized) | 254 points | by [yenniejun111](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yenniejun111) | [167 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35983707)

Language models such as OpenAI's ChatGPT rely on tokenization to generate and process text, but the process of tokenization is not uniform across all languages, resulting in disparities in the number of tokens required to represent the same expression in different languages. A recent analysis of parallel datasets of short messages translated into 52 different languages found that some languages, such as Armenian and Burmese, require up to 10 times more tokens than English to tokenize comparable messages. This has implications for the cost and efficiency of language models in different languages.

The submission discusses the issue of tokenization in language models and how some languages require more tokens to represent the same expression, resulting in efficiency and cost issues for language models in different languages. In the discussion, some users stray from the main topic and offer tangential remarks about issues such as Medium's partnership expenses, substack's financial struggles, and the intricacies of different writing systems such as Morse code and Hangul. However, there are also some interesting comments related to the main topic, including a comparison of tokenization in different Asian languages, the impact of phonetic transcription on Chinese script, and the limitations of language and pronunciation for expressing meaning in different languages.

### The Great CPU Stagnation

#### [Submission URL](http://databasearchitects.blogspot.com/2023/04/the-great-cpu-stagnation.html) | 242 points | by [greghn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=greghn) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35989462)

For decades, Moore's Law led to exponential growth in the number of transistors in CPUs, while Dennard scaling enabled higher clock frequencies. However, Dennard scaling began to falter around 2005, and clock frequencies have plateaued since then. As a result, the additional available transistors have been channeled into creating more cores per chip, leading to an era of CPU stagnation. Despite improved production nodes, the cost-adjusted figures reveal that the exponential improvement in CPU speed has come to a halt. Consequently, most software is extremely inefficient when compared to the hardware's potential, implying that maybe custom chips will have a more significant role in the future.

The comments section discusses the use of benchmarks to measure CPU performance, but there is a debate regarding which benchmarks are reliable. Some users suggest that CPU performance results are relative, while others recommend using specific benchmarks. There are also discussions on the use of outdated hardware for development and the potential benefits of using slower hardware for optimization purposes. Other topics include the use of custom chips and the advancement of mobile computing.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, is set to receive a record privacy fine from Ireland's Data Protection Commission (DPC) for failing to protect user data from the prying eyes of US security services. The DPC will also order the social media giant to halt all data transfers to the US that rely on supposedly unsafe contractual clauses challenged by the EU's top court. The anticipated fine will exceed the previous record set in 2021, when Amazon was fined €746m. This marks a continuation of a saga that began in 2013 when privacy campaigner Max Schrems challenged Facebook in Ireland, arguing that EU citizens' data was at risk when transferred to the US.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook, is facing a record privacy fine from Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) for failing to protect user data from US security services. The DPC is also expected to order the social media giant to stop all data transfers to the US that rely on contractual clauses challenged by the EU’s top court. Commentators discussed the implications of the fine, including the role of the DPC as a junior privacy regulator, the impact of Ireland’s low corporate tax rates, and the housing crisis in Ireland, as well as the relationship between foreign corporations and domestic ones. There was also discussion of the broader context of low-cost data transfers and the enforcement of policies in different jurisdictions.

#### [Submission URL](https://rssdsaisection.substack.com/p/the-alan-turing-institute-has-failed) | 171 points | by [martingoodson](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=martingoodson) | [147 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35988604)

The Alan Turing Institute, the UK's flagship institute for artificial intelligence, has failed to keep up with recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs), according to a report by Martin Goodson, the former chair of the Royal Statistical Society's Data Science and AI Section. The institute's annual reports for the last four years do not mention LLMs, whereas the government's AI strategy has not prioritised open source initiatives for developing LLMs. Goodson argues that the UK missed a key opportunity to build LLMs because of its lack of investment, poor network building and insufficient focus on open source initiatives. The discussion primarily centers around the importance of leveraging computation versus relying on human knowledge to tackle AI research. Additionally, there is a debate regarding whether trying to emulate human high-level processes leads to faster progress in AI research or hinders it.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-65631168) | 49 points | by [rwmj](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rwmj) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35985507)

Telecoms giant BT is set to cut up to 55,000 jobs by the end of the decade, with up to a fifth of the cuts coming in customer services as jobs are replaced by artificial intelligence and other technological developments. However, BT intends to remain accessible, with 450 stores and a wide range of online options. The company has said that once its ongoing expansion of its fibre network is completed, it will no longer require as many maintenance staff, and that more efficient technology and AI will mean fewer customer service staff are needed in the future. BT is the UK's largest broadband and mobile provider.

Commenters' major concerns focused on the potential negative consequences of AI replacing jobs, including how to create a society in which people can live without work and the possibility of widespread job loss. Some also criticized BT’s customer service, with multiple commenters calling for improvements to the customer experience.

### AI is coming to Google search through Search Generative Experience

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/10/23717120/google-search-ai-results-generated-experience-io) | 50 points | by [BerislavLopac](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BerislavLopac) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35987054)

Google is experimenting with a new AI-powered search experience called Search Generative Experience (SGE), which will provide users with AI-generated summaries and information at the top of their search results. Utilising its large language models and sources from the open web, the SGE will pull information from all over the web. Google's VP of Search, Liz Reid, says that the SGE is "an experiment", but it marks a long-term foundational change to the way people search for and find information online. Opting in and searching will enable users to experience search results like never before.

Some commenters expressed confusion over the use of terms like "search experience" and "user experience," while others criticized Google for sacrificing quality in search results in favor of pushing ads and SEO spam. One commenter suggested the use of competitors like DuckDuckGo or OpenAI's GPT models, while another pointed out that OpenAI's ChatGPT and SGE are not direct competitors. There were also concerns about the potential for targeted advertising and misuse of self-hosted AI models. Still, most commenters viewed the SGE as a step forward for Google's search capabilities.
