### Work Distribution with Jump Consistent Hashing

#### [Submission URL](https://zacksiri.dev/posts/work-distribution-with-jump-consistent-hashing) | 14 points | by [artellectual](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=artellectual) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36225161)

Instellar, a high availability app with multiple nodes running on Elixir, faces the issue of ensuring that a job runs only once. While using a job queue is one way to solve this, the problem with non-deterministic job runs led them to implement a distributed compute setup with GenServer and PubSub. However, this solution caused the code to run on all three nodes, defeating the purpose of the distributed system. Enter Jump Consistent Hashing, a method of generating which node a job should be assigned to, which evenly distributes workloads across all nodes while ensuring that the same installation ID is assigned to the same node. With Jumper, a library for implementing Jump Consistent Hashing, the team behind Instellar is now able to efficiently distribute workloads among multiple nodes while making real-time updates to their system.

The discussion surrounding the submission focuses on the various hashing implementations used for the system. Dowwie mentions that Discord's consistent hashing implementation is worth exploring, while User23 expresses surprise that Rendezvous hashing is not more popular due to its desirable properties, such as not requiring competition for placement, and suggests exploring it as well. Mjb provides a comparison between Consistent Hashing and Rendezvous Hashing and states that Rendezvous Hashing is a more complex technique. User23 agrees with Mjb and adds that Rendezvous Hashing requires more information to be passed between nodes and hence may not be the best solution when information efficiency is a high priority.

### I'm afraid I can't do that: Prompt refusal in generative language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.03423) | 170 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [160 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36230750)

Max Reuter and William Schulze have submitted a paper titled "I'm Afraid I Can't Do That: Predicting Prompt Refusal in Black-Box Generative Language Models" to KDD 2023, in which they examine the refusal behavior of OpenAI's ChatGPT and the fine-tuning bias that affects which prompts the model chooses to refuse. The authors use a black-box attack to query ChatGPT with offensive and benign prompts, manually labeling each response as compliance or refusal. They then train a refusal classifier using a small manually-labeled dataset and use it to bootstrap a larger dataset on which they train a prompt classifier to predict whether ChatGPT will refuse a given question. The prompt classifier achieves 76% accuracy on a test set of manually labeled questions, and the authors examine the classifiers and the prompt n-grams that are most predictive of either compliance or refusal.

Ken Griffin, the founder and CEO of Citadel, has said that the near-term hype around generative AI is a "terrible mistake". Speaking to Citadel's new class of interns, Griffin believes the AI community is creating a "huge disservice" by creating such a buzz around AI, although he does concede that AI will one day be transformative. However, he argues that the threat of AI eliminating white-collar jobs is far from reality due to the need for precision and accuracy in finance. Griffin also suggests that the biggest target for generative AI is programming and software engineering, and that it is crucial for software engineers to be close to domain problems that need to be solved.
