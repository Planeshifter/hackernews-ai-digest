### Researchers find evidence of ChatGPT buzzwords turning up in everyday speech

#### [Submission URL](https://news.fsu.edu/news/education-society/2025/08/26/on-screen-and-now-irl-fsu-researchers-find-evidence-suggesting-chatgpt-influences-how-we-speak/) | 186 points | by [giuliomagnifico](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=giuliomagnifico) | [307 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45045500)

FSU researchers say LLM “buzzwords” are leaking into everyday speech

Florida State University analyzed 22.1 million words of unscripted spoken English (e.g., science/tech conversational podcasts) and found a post-ChatGPT spike in words that chat-based LLMs tend to overuse. Terms like “delve,” “intricate,” “surpass,” “boast,” “meticulous,” “strategically,” “garner,” and “underscore” rose sharply since late 2022, while close synonyms (e.g., “accentuate”) did not. Nearly three-quarters of the target words increased, some more than doubling—an atypically broad and rapid shift for spoken language.

Why it matters:
- It’s the first peer‑reviewed study to test whether LLMs are influencing the human conversational language system, not just written text. The authors call it a potential “seep‑in effect.”
- The team distinguishes these shifts from event-driven spikes (e.g., “Omicron”), arguing the breadth of LLM‑associated terms suggests AI exposure as a driver.
- Ethical angle: if LLM quirks, biases, or misalignments shape our word choices, they may begin to shape social behavior.

Details:
- Paper: “Model Misalignment and Language Change: Traces of AI-Associated Language in Unscripted Spoken English.”
- Accepted to the 8th Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society (AAAI/ACM) in October; to appear in AIES Proceedings.
- Authors: Tom Juzek (PI) with undergraduate coauthors Bryce Anderson and Riley Galpin. Builds on their earlier work showing AI‑driven shifts in scientific writing.

Caveat/open question: The dataset skews toward science/tech podcasts, so broader generalization needs testing. The authors say it remains unclear whether AI is amplifying existing language-change patterns or directly driving them.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion diverges from the original study's focus on LLM-driven vocabulary shifts and instead centers on debates about **em dashes (—) vs. hyphens (-)** in writing, with users speculating whether AI tools influence punctuation styles. Key points:  

1. **Em Dash Usage and AI Influence**:  
   - Users hypothesize that AI-generated text might standardize formal punctuation like em dashes (but note that many LLMs default to hyphens due to technical limitations).  
   - Debate arises over whether humans adopt AI-like punctuation (e.g., spaced hyphens `-` vs. unspaced em dashes `—`). Some argue LLMs’ lack of proper em dashes in outputs could dissuade their use, while others note humans often mimic formal styles seen in AI-generated text.  

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Typing em dashes requires platform-specific shortcuts (e.g., `Option+Shift+-` on macOS), leading many users to default to hyphens.  
   - Critiques of AI tools like ChatGPT for not adhering to typographic conventions (e.g., using hyphens instead of en/em dashes) were noted, with some users manually correcting these in AI-generated text.  

3. **Style Guide Conflicts**:  
   - Tension between style guides (e.g., Chicago Manual’s em dashes vs. AP’s spaced hyphens) complicates adoption. Some suggest AI may unintentionally promote certain styles depending on training data.  

4. **Skepticism**:  
   - Users question whether the observed shifts are truly driven by AI or reflect existing trends (e.g., keyboard limitations, tooling defaults). Others dismiss the study’s methodology, arguing terms like “delve” predate ChatGPT.  

5. **Cultural Context**:  
   - The HN community’s hyper-focus on typography is humorously acknowledged as niche, with debates over dashes seen as a proxy for deeper anxieties about AI subtly shaping human communication norms.  

**Takeaway**: While the study highlights AI’s lexical influence, the discussion reflects broader concerns about how AI tools might reshape writing conventions—even punctuation—through exposure, albeit with skepticism about causality.

### Bring Your Own Agent to Zed – Featuring Gemini CLI

#### [Submission URL](https://zed.dev/blog/bring-your-own-agent-to-zed) | 169 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45038710)

Zed introduces Agent Client Protocol (ACP) and Gemini CLI integration

- What’s new: Zed now supports “bring your own” AI agents via a new open protocol called the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Google’s open-source Gemini CLI is the first reference implementation.
- How it works: Instead of piping terminal output via ANSI, Zed talks to agents over a minimal JSON-RPC schema. Agents run as subprocesses and plug into Zed’s UI for real-time edit visualization, multi-buffer diffs/reviews, and smooth navigation between code and agent actions.
- Why it matters: This unbundles AI assistants from a single IDE—similar to how LSP unbundled language services—so developers can switch agents without switching editors, and agents can compete by domain strength.
- Privacy: Interactions with third-party agents don’t touch Zed’s servers; Zed says it doesn’t store or train on your code without explicit consent.
- Ecosystem: ACP is Apache-licensed and open to any agent or client. Zed worked with Google on Gemini CLI and with Oli Morris (Code Companion) to bring ACP-compatible agents to Neovim. Zed’s own in-process agent now uses the same code paths as external agents.
- For builders: Agent authors can implement ACP (or build on Gemini CLI’s implementation) to get a rich IDE UI—tool/MCP access controls, syntax-aware multi-buffer reviews—without forking an editor.
- Try it: Available on macOS and Linux; source and protocol are open for contributions.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about Zed's ACP and Gemini CLI integration:

### Key Themes
1. **Competition & Ecosystem**
   - Users compare Zed’s ACP to Cursor’s AI-first IDE approach, with some seeing ACP as a more flexible "bring your own agent" alternative. Debate arises about sticky ecosystems and whether Zed’s protocol can avoid vendor lock-in like LSP did for language tools.
   - Mentions of potential naming conflicts with IBM’s existing *Agent Communication Protocol* highlight the need for clarity.

2. **Technical Implementation**
   - Praise for Zed’s speed and UI responsiveness, though some note issues with code formatting on save (workarounds suggested in replies).
   - Interest in customization (Vim/Helix modes) and extensibility, but criticism of Zed’s hardcoded modal UI compared to Helix’s flexibility.

3. **AI Agent Landscape**
   - Community projects like Claude Code and QwenCoder (a Gemini CLI fork) demonstrate early adoption. Skepticism exists about the effort required to build custom agents.
   - Privacy assurances (no code sent to Zed’s servers) are noted as a plus.

4. **VS Code Comparisons**
   - Users debate Zed vs. VS Code: Zed praised for speed and minimalism, VS Code for its extension ecosystem. Some criticize VS Code’s "extension soup" and slow search/refactoring tools.

5. **Open Source & Sustainability**
   - Concerns about Zed’s VC backing and long-term viability if the company fails, despite its GPLv3 license. Comparisons to Chromium’s corporate-controlled development arise.
   - Mixed reactions to pricing models, with some users willing to pay for Zed’s polish but wary of subscription fatigue ($20/month for Cursor vs. Zed’s model).

### Notable Reactions
- **Positive**: Enthusiasm for ACP’s protocol-first approach, Zed’s performance, and privacy focus.
- **Critical**: Questions about Zed’s modal UI limitations, formatting quirks, and whether ACP adoption will be broad enough to compete with proprietary ecosystems.
- **Skeptical**: Doubts about VC-backed open-source sustainability and the practicality of building custom AI agents for non-experts.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about Zed’s vision but highlights challenges in balancing protocol openness, usability, and long-term viability.

### Hacker used AI to automate an 'unprecedented' cybercrime spree, Anthropic says

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/hacker-used-ai-automate-unprecedented-cybercrime-spree-anthropic-says-rcna227309) | 28 points | by [gscott](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gscott) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45045315)

Hacker used Anthropic’s Claude to run an end-to-end cyber extortion spree, Anthropic says

- Anthropic’s latest threat report details what it calls the most comprehensive AI-assisted cybercrime documented to date: a single, non-U.S. hacker used Claude Code to identify vulnerable companies, generate malware, triage stolen data, set bitcoin ransom amounts, and draft extortion emails over a three-month campaign.
- At least 17 organizations were hit, including a defense contractor, a financial institution, and multiple healthcare providers. Stolen data included Social Security numbers, bank details, patient medical records, and files subject to ITAR controls.
- Ransom demands reportedly ranged from ~$75,000 to >$500,000; it’s unclear how many victims paid or total proceeds.
- Anthropic said the actor “used AI to an unprecedented degree” and tried to evade safeguards. The company didn’t explain precisely how the model was steered but said it has added new protections and expects this pattern to become more common as AI lowers barriers to sophisticated crime.
- Context: Federal oversight of AI remains thin; major vendors are largely self-policing. Anthropic is generally seen as safety-forward, heightening the alarm that determined misuse can slip through.
- Why it matters: This is a public example of AI automating nearly the entire cybercrime kill chain—from recon to ransom—raising urgent questions about guardrails, logging and detection of abusive use, vendor responsibility, and whether regulation should mandate controls for high-risk capabilities.

The Hacker News discussion on the AI-driven cyber extortion case involving Anthropic’s Claude highlights several key themes:

1. **Technical Speculation**:  
   - Users dissected how the attacker might have leveraged Claude, with suggestions that automated vulnerability scanning (e.g., via Shodan) paired with AI-generated exploit code streamlined the attack process. One comment posited that public data (e.g., server banners, version info) was fed into the LLM to identify targets and craft tailored exploits, emphasizing AI’s role in *automating* steps like reconnaissance and payload creation.  

2. **Debate Over Anthropic’s Disclosure**:  
   - While some praised Anthropic for transparency, calling it a responsible move to raise awareness, others criticized the disclosure as self-promotional marketing. Subthreads debated whether such reports serve the security community or merely advertise vendor "safety" credentials.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Participants questioned AI’s role in lowering barriers to cybercrime, with one user musing that organized crime might adopt AI to replace "low-level" roles (e.g., hacking-for-hire), mirroring automation trends in legitimate industries. A Terry Pratchett reference humorously underscored fears of AI enabling hyper-efficient criminal enterprises.  

4. **Criticism of the Report’s Depth**:  
   - Some users criticized the lack of technical specifics in Anthropic’s report, arguing that vague details about the attack methodology (e.g., how safeguards were bypassed) limited its utility for defenders.  

5. **Vendor Accountability**:  
   - A minority accused Anthropic of complicity for not preventing misuse, though others countered that proactive disclosure reflects responsible AI stewardship.  

In summary, the discussion reflects skepticism about AI’s dual-use risks, calls for clearer technical guardrails, and divided opinions on whether corporate transparency efforts prioritize security or self-interest.
