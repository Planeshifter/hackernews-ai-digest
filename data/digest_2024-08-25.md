In an interesting experiment, Greg Wilson shared a nifty trick using the AI tool Claude 3.5 to simplify scheduling for his jazz piano lessons. Faced with a JPG image of his lesson schedule, which contained 13 dates outlined in green that needed to go into Google Calendar, Greg opted to leverage the AI instead of manually entering the dates.

He began by uploading the image to Claude and prompted it to extract the dates marked in green. To his delight, the AI accurately listed all the lesson dates. But he didn't stop there! He asked Claude to generate an .ics file for these appointments, complete with a title ("Jazz Piano Lesson") and time (2:00 PM Pacific Time) set for each date.

The result? A detailed .ics file that was ready for import into Google Calendar, allowing Greg to skip the tedious task of entering each event manually. He praised the seamless process, noting that importing the file worked perfectly in Google Calendar.

Interestingly, he had also tried the same task using ChatGPT, which could identify the dates but couldn't create the .ics file directly. Instead, it provided Python code for manual creation, showcasing a clear advantage for Claude in this context.

This clever use of AI demonstrates a "stupid but useful" trick that emphasizes how technology can streamline everyday tasks, making tools like Claude a go-to for anyone looking to enhance their productivity.

In a thought-provoking post on Twitter, programmer and self-identified "programming artist" ThePrimeagen challenges the increasing reliance on large language models (LLMs) in coding. While many have embraced LLMs for boosting productivity and simplifying coding tasks, ThePrimeagen argues that their effectiveness is often exaggerated and expresses a strong preference for the artistry of programming itself.

He breaks down programming into two core components: algorithmically solving problems and effectively expressing those solutions in code. For him, programming is more than a technical task; it’s a creative process akin to painting, where the journey of problem-solving holds as much value as the final result. Automating coding with LLMs feels to him like outsourcing the act of painting—it removes the joy and personal expression inherent in the craft.

Expressing concern over a cultural shift that appears to prioritize quick fixes over the artistic value of coding, ThePrimeagen wonders whether the true spirit of programming is fading. He acknowledges that not everyone finds joy in coding and that it’s perfectly acceptable to seek efficiency, but he laments the diminishing appreciation for the craft among today’s programmers. His reflections encourage a deeper conversation about the balance between leveraging technology and preserving the love for the art of programming.
