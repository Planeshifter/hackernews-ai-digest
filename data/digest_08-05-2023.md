#### [Submission URL](https://mkone.ai/blog/introducing-mk1) | 279 points | by [ejz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ejz) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37016413)

MK-1 is a new startup that aims to provide companies with the same efficient language model capabilities as elite AI powerhouses like OpenAI and Google. Their first product, MKML, is an inference runtime that can significantly reduce the costs and improve the performance of large language models on GPUs.

One of the main challenges that MKML addresses is the large memory footprint of these models, which can limit performance and increase costs. MKML has developed a compression technique that can reduce the size of models by about 60%, while maintaining a high fidelity to the original model. For example, a Llama-2 13B model that initially requires 26GB of memory can be shrunk down to just 10.5GB with MKML.

The benefits of using MKML are twofold. Firstly, it allows companies to use lower-cost GPU instances that have less memory capacity, without sacrificing performance. For example, the compressed Llama-2 13B model can now fit on a single A10 24GB instance, which is about 45% less expensive than the A100 instance. Secondly, for companies that can afford the more powerful A100 instance, MKML can increase performance by up to 2.0x compared to the baseline model.

MKML is designed to be easy to integrate into existing workflows and works seamlessly with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch. With just a few lines of Python code, developers can compress their models and use MKML for inference.

The performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, and the results consistently show that it outperforms the baseline model in terms of token generation speed. Additionally, the compressed models maintain a high level of fidelity, with only a small difference in perplexity compared to the original models.

MK-1 is currently in closed beta release, but if you're interested in becoming an early partner and gaining access to new features, you can contact them for more information. With MKML, companies can optimize their inference stack, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of their language models.

The discussion around the submission on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of MKML and its comparison to existing methods.

One commenter points out that quantization methods that are already available usually provide comparable results to what MKML is claiming. They mention that these techniques have already been widely used and question the novelty of MKML's approach.

The founder of MK-1, Paul Merolla, responds to address the comments. He explains that MKML is designed to be a targeted solution that focuses on compressing models with high performance and efficiency. He highlights that MKML builds on the existing framework of Hugging Face and other popular ecosystems. He also mentions that the performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, consistently outperforming the baseline models.

Another commenter raises a question about the integration of MKML and the existing frameworks like Hugging Face. Paul Merolla responds and clarifies that MKML is not simply repackaging existing frameworks, but rather integrating its own compression scheme. He emphasizes that MKML targets multi-task, multi-prompt batch=1 use cases and achieves faster token generation speed compared to other methods.

The discussion further delves into specific technical questions about memory footprint, batch sizes, and model performance. Paul Merolla provides detailed answers and also mentions that MK-1 is working on wrapping their techniques and tools into open-source software.

There are also discussions about other quantization techniques, such as 4-bit and 8-bit quantization, and their potential application to speed up model inference.

Overall, the discussion is a mix of skepticism, technical questions, and comparisons to existing methods. Some commenters are interested in seeing more comprehensive benchmarks and comparisons to validate MKML's claims. Others express concern about proprietary dependencies and the lack of open-source solutions for model compression.

### The Myth of AI Omniscience: AI's Epistemological Limits

#### [Submission URL](https://cpwalker.substack.com/p/the-myth-of-ai-omniscience-ais-epistemological) | 82 points | by [cpwalker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cpwalker) | [98 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37012501)

In his recent article, Chris Walker explores the myth of AI omniscience and the epistemological limits of artificial intelligence. He highlights the apocalyptic prophecy surrounding AI, with discussions of superintelligence either saving or destroying humanity. OpenAI's investment into "superalignment" research further fuels this discourse. Walker addresses the notion of a superintelligence having "vast power" and examines Elon Musk's xAI venture, which aims to understand the true nature of the universe. He argues that AI models, regardless of their architecture, are ultimately limited by the fact that they are trained on human-written texts. Therefore, their understanding of the universe is shaped by human understanding and does not go beyond our current knowledge. Walker draws upon the philosophical perspective of William James to emphasize that human understanding of truth is constructed and shaped by our experiences, interests, and concepts, and AI models are bound by these limitations. In conclusion, he challenges the idea that an AI can achieve an absolute understanding of the universe and emphasizes the need to focus on the AI issues that truly matter for society.

The discussion revolves around the limitations of language models (LLMs) and their ability to combine existing concepts in novel ways. Some users argue that LLMs are fundamentally limited by the vocabulary and concepts they are trained on, while others suggest that LLMs can generate novel combinations of concepts in unique ways. There is also debate about the significance of artistic creativity and whether LLMs can surpass human abilities in that regard. Other topics discussed include the difficulty of combining language in novel ways, the challenges of defining and understanding language, and the potential for LLMs to learn from training data without truly understanding it. There is also a brief mention of withholding code or data to prevent complete training of LLMs, although one user cautions against publishing code on GitHub due to potential exposure.
