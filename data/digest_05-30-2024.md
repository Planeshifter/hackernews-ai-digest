#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/1-bit-llm) | 248 points | by [jnord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jnord) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40529355)

The latest issue of IEEE Spectrum covers a groundbreaking solution to AI's energy demands with the introduction of 1-bit LLMs. These smaller, faster, and energy-efficient models are revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. By significantly reducing the precision of parameters in neural networks, researchers have managed to create LLMs that can run directly on devices like cellphones.

Two main approaches have been used to create 1-bit LLMs: post-training quantization (PTQ) and quantization-aware training (QAT). The PTQ method, particularly the BiLLM introduced by a team of researchers, has shown promising results in compressing models while maintaining performance. The 1-bit LLMs not only consume less energy but also require much less memory capacity compared to their full-precision counterparts.

With the potential to optimize custom hardware and systems for 1-bit LLMs, this technology opens new possibilities for the future of AI. Researchers are exploring various methods to advance this field further, aiming to make AI models more efficient, accessible, and eco-friendly.

The discussion on the submission about 1-bit LLMs and quantization on Hacker News covers various perspectives and insights. Some users delve into the technical aspects, such as the comparison between different models like Llama3 and GPT-4, the impact of quantization on model performance, and the complexities of symmetries in network architectures. Other users discuss the challenges of training large language models (LLMs) and the implications of reaching near-perfect accuracy in AI models. The conversation also touches on the limitations of human expertise in training models and the potential of LLMs to transform knowledge retrieval and learning processes. Overall, the comments reflect a deep interest in the advancements and possibilities of AI technologies like 1-bit LLMs and quantization techniques.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.assembled.com/blog/better-rag-results-with-reciprocal-rank-fusion-and-hybrid-search) | 232 points | by [johnjwang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johnjwang) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40524759)

At Assembled, a company focused on enhancing customer support, the team encountered challenges with their Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system when relying solely on vector-based search. This limitation led to suboptimal results for specific queries, especially when there were multiple articles on similar topics or ambiguous keywords entered by users. To address this issue, the team implemented a Hybrid Search approach, combining keyword search with vector search for better performance, creating a more effective and user-friendly system.

The implementation involved developing a document store abstraction to integrate multiple search algorithms seamlessly. This abstraction allowed for easy swapping of different search systems, enabling parallel searches across various document stores. To ensure synchronization between stores, the team maintained a single source of truth in a PostgreSQL database and S3 storage, handling asynchronous updates and error management effectively.

To enhance search performance further, the team explored algorithms for merging results from different document stores. Initially, they experimented with weighting mechanisms to leverage the strengths of each search method but faced challenges due to varying similarity scores and performance metrics across their customer base. Despite these challenges, the team's innovative approach and solutions improved the accuracy and efficiency of their RAG system, providing users with better search results and a more seamless experience.
