#### [Submission URL](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing) | 740 points | by [nabla9](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nabla9) | [486 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39575803)

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice are cracking down on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market. In a joint legal brief, they emphasized that using technology to collude on rental pricing is still illegal under antitrust laws. With rental prices soaring, landlords using algorithms to set prices may hinder competition and harm consumers. The agencies warn that agreeing to use a shared pricing algorithm is considered collusion, and deviations from suggested prices do not justify illegal behavior. This crackdown extends beyond the housing industry, with cases involving online resales and meat processing competitors. The message is clear: whether it's through algorithms or other means, price-fixing will not be tolerated.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about the crackdown on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market delves into various aspects of using software tools like YieldStar to set pricing in the rental industry. Users discuss the legality of using algorithms to set public information prices, subscription services for pricing data, implications of not following suggested pricing, and the sharing of rental control data. Some users point out that collusion does not require a formal contract, while others mention court cases involving RealPage and Yardi Systems. Overall, the conversation highlights complex legal and ethical considerations when it comes to pricing algorithms and their implications on competition and consumer welfare.

Some users explore the vulnerabilities in LLMs when faced with ASCII art prompts and the potential for exploiting these weaknesses, while others question the need for enhanced security measures for LLMs. There are also discussions on the limitations of LLMs in understanding and responding to different types of inputs, as well as the challenges in controlling the behavior of LLMs. Overall, the discussions delve into the complexities of ensuring the safety and reliability of LLMs in various scenarios, along with the ethical considerations surrounding their use.

### Researchers create AI worms that can spread from one system to another

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/) | 40 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39575308)

Researchers have created generative AI worms that can spread through AI systems, potentially stealing data or deploying malware. These AI worms, named Morris II, were designed to attack generative AI email assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini by exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems. The worms work by tricking the AI model into generating further malicious instructions, akin to traditional computer attacks like SQL injection.
By using adversarial prompts, the researchers were able to demonstrate how the AI worm could infect an email system, steal sensitive user data, and even forward malicious messages to other clients. The potential risks posed by these generative AI worms are significant, especially as AI systems become more interconnected and autonomous in performing tasks like sending emails or making appointments.
While the research serves as a warning about vulnerabilities in AI architectures, it also highlights the importance of implementing robust security measures to safeguard against such attacks. Even though the demonstration was conducted in a controlled environment, cybersecurity experts emphasize the need for developers to take the threat of generative AI worms seriously, particularly in scenarios where AI agents are granted permissions to act on behalf of users. The implications of these AI worms could be far-reaching and may require proactive measures to mitigate potential risks.

The discussion on the submission about generative AI worms highlights various perspectives and concerns. The conversation delves into the intricacies of defending against potential AI attacks, emphasizing the need for well-defined scopes and parameters in AI models to prevent malicious behavior. Participants mention the challenges of securing AI systems, particularly when dealing with sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities. 
Furthermore, the discussion touches upon the complexities of email processing and the importance of ensuring secure communication practices. There are also references made to real-world scenarios such as the use of drones in warfare and the significance of resource allocation in cybersecurity efforts. Additionally, the conversation underscores the need for vigilance in addressing security issues and the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement in defense mechanisms against evolving threats.
