### Solving Redactle with Decision Trees

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.valentin.sh/redactle/) | 28 points | by [foobuzzHN](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=foobuzzHN) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41427121)

In a fascinating exploration of the game Redactle, Valentin dives into optimizing the guessing strategy using decision trees. Redactle challenges players to deduce the hidden title of a redacted Wikipedia article by submitting words to "unredact" portions of the text. Valentin proposes a systematic approach: instead of guessing random words, players should focus on terms that effectively halve the pool of possible articles, allowing for a more efficient search.

Through a theoretical framework, he establishes that if the right words are chosen, players could pinpoint the article in as few as 14 guesses, given the limited set of around 10,000 essential articles on Wikipedia. To test this theory, Valentin gathered a vast dataset of 55 million words from these articles, identifying one of the largest entries as the "History of Austria" and the smallest as a curious piece on "Phoenicopterus."

To implement this strategy, he turns to decision tree algorithms, which classify based on features—in this case, whether a given word appears in an article. Instead of aiming for a simple 50/50 split, these algorithms seek to maximize the homogeneity of resulting groups, effectively creating a more nuanced and effective classification system. Through this innovative intersection of gaming and data science, Valentin showcases how decision trees can transform the way we approach Redactle, paving the way for more strategic gameplay.

In a recent discussion about the game Redactle, participants engaged in an analysis of Valentin's proposed guessing strategy leveraging decision trees. One user, *gjm11*, expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of the algorithm, suggesting that it may not accurately align with real-word guessing patterns. They noted that playing the game often involves a more intuitive and human-centric approach rather than strictly following algorithmic logic.

Another user, *npnskr*, added that making Wikipedia articles the basis for a guessing game introduces an interesting challenge, akin to Wordle, but potentially more complex. They argued that while the use of algorithms is fascinating, the randomness and unpredictability of human guessing patterns should not be overlooked.

*gjm11* also mentioned the limitations of large language models (LLMs) in this context, emphasizing that they can be significantly different from expert human players who have mastered the structure and patterns commonly found in Wikipedia articles. Participants exchanged ideas about how to enhance gameplay and the strategic implications of word length and structure within articles.

Overall, while there was appreciation for the mathematical approach underpinning Valentin's analysis, many participants highlighted the nuanced and often unpredictable nature of human guessing in Redactle gameplay, suggesting a balance between statistical analysis and human intuition.
