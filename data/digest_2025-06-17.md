### Real-time action chunking with large models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pi.website/research/real_time_chunking) | 42 points | by [pr337h4m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pr337h4m) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44303021)

In the fast-paced world of robotics, staying a step ahead—literally—is not just advantageous, it's vital. A robot missing a beat could spill your coffee or scramble crucial tasks like plugging in an Ethernet cable. In a captivating new study, Kevin Black, Manuel Y. Galliker, and Sergey Levine dive into the nuances of Real-Time Action Chunking with Large Models, crafting a strategy to tackle the urgent need for real-time execution in autonomous systems.

The primary challenge hinges on the asynchrony of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). Moving beyond the realms of static text and image generation, these models operate in real time—meaning they must think and act simultaneously. Current methods like action chunking deliver multiple consecutive actions per inference cycle, which is crucial but problematic. These chunks often lead to discontinuities between old and new actions, resulting in stuttering motion or even catastrophic errors.

Enter Real-Time Chunking (RTC): an inventive algorithm that harmonizes execution in a way that is both smooth and adaptable to change. Unlike older approaches that pause to process the next action chunk—awkwardly freezing our robot at the end of each cycle—RTC keeps the robot moving seamlessly, removing the dreaded hiccup between chunks.

RTC treats the transition between action chunks as an inpainting problem, akin to filling in missing parts of an image. By retaining some actions from the previous chunk while overlaying them with new, updated inputs, the algorithm transitions smoothly between different movements. This methodology not only preserves consistency but also adapts to new data—allowing VLAs to stay synchronously agile with the world around them, regardless of any imposed latency.

Tests reveal RTC's prowess, even with artificial delays exceeding 300 milliseconds. Tasks that demand precision and swift adaptation are no longer slowed down by cumbersome inference pauses. Instead, RTC ensures that robots can both think and act on the go—drawing from a blend of learned intuition and current information without requiring additional training.

This new frontier in robotics, as demonstrated by the team's work, promises to revolutionize task execution—a leap towards a future where robots handle dynamic environments with the grace and precision akin to human coordination, no matter the computational limits. From everyday errands to complex interactions, RTC could redefine the relationship between machines and the fluid, ever-changing world they navigate.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion highlights enthusiasm for the research on Real-Time Chunking (RTC), with users expressing excitement about its implications for robotics. One user mentions building a robot project and praises the work, while another notes RTC’s ability to handle 300ms+ delays in tasks like plugging Ethernet cables and stabilizing control loops. The practical significance for real-world applications (e.g., precise robotic movements) is underscored. A commenter also shares an open-source resource (Physical Intelligence’s [OpenPi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)) for Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), suggesting community-driven tools to explore the concepts further. Overall, the conversation blends technical admiration, practical use-case considerations, and resource recommendations.

### Building Effective AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) | 481 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301809)

In an insightful post, Anthropic shares valuable lessons gained from collaborating with numerous teams across various industries on building large language model (LLM) agents. Published on December 19, 2024, the post debunks the myth that complex frameworks are always necessary for successful LLM implementations. Instead, it highlights that simple, composable patterns are often the key to building effective agents.

**Defining Agents vs. Workflows**: Anthropic distinguishes between "workflow" and "agent" systems. While workflows rely on predefined code paths to structure LLM and tool orchestration, agents are capable of dynamically directing their own processes and tool usage, allowing for greater adaptability and decision-making potential. The discussion provides a nuanced understanding of when to opt for these agentic systems—balancing the trade-off between complexity, latency, and task performance.

**Framework Usage and Simplicity**: The post advises developers to stick to LLM APIs for a straightforward implementation before considering frameworks like LangChain's LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent, or GUI tools like Rivet and Vellum. Overreliance on frameworks might introduce unnecessary complexity and obscure the core processes. Ensuring you comprehend what's under the hood is crucial to prevent common errors.

**Key Patterns and Implementations**: Anthropic delves into specific agentic patterns, starting with the foundational augmented LLM, which enriches standard capabilities with retrieval, tools, and memory. These augmented LLMs are essential in both workflows and more autonomous agentic systems, offering developers the flexibility to tailor solutions to specific needs.

1. **Prompt Chaining Workflow**: This pattern decomposes tasks into manageable steps, where each LLM call builds on the previous one. It’s particularly beneficial for tasks that can be neatly segmented, trading latency for accuracy.
   
2. **Routing Workflow**: Ideal for tasks that can be categorized, routing directs inputs to specialized processes, enhancing specialization without compromising performance across varied task types.

The post emphasizes a pragmatic approach: use the simplest solution possible for your LLM applications and only introduce agentic complexity when absolutely necessary. This methodology ensures not only efficiency but also adaptability across diverse application domains.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's insights on LLM agents and frameworks reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Frameworks vs. Simplicity**:  
   - Many agree with the article’s emphasis on starting simple, avoiding overcomplication with frameworks like LangChain or Bedrock. Critics argue frameworks often introduce unnecessary abstraction, runtime errors (e.g., LangChain’s JSON blobs and weak typing in Python), and obscure core processes.  
   - Counterpoints suggest frameworks *can* aid in observability, security, and cross-vendor LLM compatibility, but only if their internals are well-understood.  

2. **Workflows vs. Agents**:  
   - Debate arises over Anthropic’s definitions. Some argue modern workflow engines (e.g., temporal.io) are already dynamic, blurring the line between workflows and agents. Others clarify workflows enforce structured, predictable paths (e.g., refund processes), while agents handle open-ended tasks with autonomy (e.g., customer service).  
   - A historical correction notes "workflow" has long been a software term, not newly defined by Anthropic.

3. **Implementation Challenges**:  
   - Cost and latency: Multi-agent systems (e.g., 6 agents per query) can become prohibitively expensive ($2/query) and complex to orchestrate.  
   - Technical hurdles: Prompt injection vulnerabilities, regression in newer models (e.g., Gemini), and accidental costs from conversational history bloat are noted.  
   - Sub-agents and concurrency: Some share examples of using Claude for sub-tasks (e.g., research, code patches) but highlight the lack of standardized frameworks for parallel tool calls.

4. **Real-World Use Cases**:  
   - Success stories: One user’s company built a scalable agent system from scratch using LangGraph, contradicting the article’s framework skepticism. Others advocate for hybrid approaches—simple patterns for core logic, with frameworks added only for specific needs (e.g., observability).  

5. **Philosophical Debates**:  
   - A recurring question: *Should AI agents self-improve via "swarms" working 24/7?* Critics dismiss this as vague, while others cite practical barriers (cost, control).  

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores a pragmatic split—some advocate minimalism and clarity, while others see value in frameworks for specific scenarios. The consensus leans toward understanding core patterns first, then judiciously adopting frameworks where they solve clear problems (e.g., observability, concurrency). Definitions of workflows/agents remain fluid, reflecting the evolving landscape of LLM applications.

### LLMs pose an interesting problem for DSL designers

#### [Submission URL](https://kirancodes.me/posts/log-lang-design-llms.html) | 202 points | by [gopiandcode](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gopiandcode) | [132 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44302797)

The landscape of programming language design is rapidly evolving with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In a recent discussion, "Programming Language Design in the Era of LLMs: A Return to Mediocrity?", the tension between traditional domain-specific languages (DSLs) and the capabilities of LLMs is explored, posing an intriguing question about the future of language design.

Historically, programming languages have been meticulously crafted to provide a syntax and semantics that align with the intuitions and needs of specific domains. This specialization has allowed developers to focus on solving complex problems without being bogged down by repetitive code or potential errors. DSLs, like the example provided for video game dialogue, make incorrect programming almost impossible and minimize bugs by embedding domain-specific rules directly into the language itself.

However, with the advent of LLMs from companies like ChatGPT and CoPilot, the need for specially crafted languages is in question. LLMs can generate diverse code snippets, removing boilerplate concerns without requiring specialized languages. These models perform exceptionally well with widely used languages like Python, but struggle with more niche languages, impacting the development and utility of DSLs.

This raises a critical challenge: will the ease and flexibility offered by LLMs overshadow the benefits of DSLs? The worry is that DSL development might stagnate if they entail losing the ability to use LLM-generated code.

Despite these concerns, there are optimistic paths forward. One approach is training LLMs specifically for DSLs, potentially integrating them with more commonly used languages like Python to enhance their understanding and utility. This collaboration could bridge the gap between DSLs and LLM efficiency, encouraging a future where bespoke language design and LLMs coexist, expanding the horizons of what is possible in software development.

As technology evolves, the conversation remains open. The balance between human-led language design and machine-driven code generation continues to be a fertile ground for innovation, prompting ongoing exploration and collaboration among developers and researchers.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the evolving role of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in the context of LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot. Here are the key points:

### **Tension Between LLMs and DSLs**
1. **DSL Strengths vs. LLM Flexibility**:  
   DSLs historically reduce errors and simplify domain-specific tasks (e.g., game dialogue scripting), but LLMs are now challenging this by generating boilerplate-free code in general-purpose languages like Python. Users note LLMs struggle with niche or newer DSLs due to limited training data, potentially discouraging DSL adoption.

2. **Stagnation Concerns**:  
   Some fear widespread LLM use could push developers toward established languages/frameworks (e.g., Python, React) at the expense of DSL innovation. Custom protocols or DSL-specific logic might be sidelined if LLMs prioritize popular, well-documented tools.

### **Potential Solutions and Optimism**
- **Training LLMs for DSLs**:  
  Proposals include fine-tuning LLMs on DSLs or integrating DSLs into mainstream frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, JSX) to make them LLM-friendly. Regex was cited as a DSL success story where LLMs perform well due to abundant examples.  
- **Embedded DSLs**:  
  Frameworks like React’s JSX or LINQ in C# show how DSLs embedded within host languages can thrive, balancing expressiveness with LLM compatibility.  

### **Historical and Linguistic Parallels**
- **Compiler History**:  
  Past compiler optimizations (e.g., Fran Allen’s work) faced similar trade-offs between high-level abstractions and low-level efficiency, mirroring today’s DSL-LLM tension.  
- **Language Standardization**:  
  Comparisons were drawn to natural language evolution (e.g., post-printing press English standardization), suggesting LLMs might accelerate programming language homogenization.  

### **Criticisms and Skepticism**
- **Code Quality**:  
  Users debated whether LLM-generated code would lead to “disposable” or verbose output, increasing maintenance costs. Skilled programmers may still be needed to refine AI code into efficient abstractions.  
- **Adoption Challenges**:  
  Niche domains like game engine shaders or hardware-specific logic (e.g., iOS features) may resist LLM-driven shifts if training data is sparse.  

### **Futuristic Speculation**
- **AI-Driven Ecosystems**:  
  Jokes about “Skynet” aside, some posited that future AI systems might use higher-level DSLs for efficiency, reducing token overhead and enabling faster iteration.  

**Conclusion**: While LLMs risk sidelining DSLs by favoring mainstream tools, collaborative approaches—integrating DSLs into frameworks, targeted LLM training, and leveraging embedded patterns—offer hope for coexistence. The debate underscores ongoing balancing acts between innovation, practicality, and the evolving role of AI in software design.

### Time Series Forecasting with Graph Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://kumo.ai/research/time-series-forecasting/) | 112 points | by [turntable_pride](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=turntable_pride) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301998)

The exploration of time series forecasting through graph-structured data has taken center stage, emerging as a crucial tool for modern businesses strategies. Most of our world’s data resides in relational databases, making this topic particularly relevant.

In traditional setups, time series forecasting often occurs in isolation—tapping into the sequence of past data points to predict future ones. However, many real-world scenarios indicate the value of integrating related data sources, such as marketing campaigns or economic indicators, is often underestimated. Steps toward harnessing this interconnectedness involve leveraging graphs, which naturally depict the relationships between various data points, allowing a deeper dive into relational structures.

The process involves converting relational tables from databases into graph structures using Relational Deep Learning (RDL) to convert these into node-led entities with features crucial for forecasting on subsets of these nodes. This transformation aligns with the need for graph-based learning methods, such as Graph Transformers, to robustly predict outcomes influenced by myriad interconnected data points.

Consider an example where forecasting daily sales of products is augmented by incorporating tables of transactions, customers, and marketing efforts. The RDL scheme turns these interconnections into a formidable graph, enriching each node with features leveraging the underlying relationships.

An essential aspect of this endeavor is melding various signals — including graph, past sequence, date-time, and calendar encodings — within a cohesive forecasting framework. For instance, date-time and calendar encodings enable models to account for recurring seasonal patterns, holidays, or unexpected spikes. Meanwhile, past sequence encodings help encode the history, vital for capturing prevailing trends.

The architecture synergizes these elements, using embeddings from both past data and graph structures to predict future events. Graph encodings, drawn from a temporal subgraph sampling process, allow scaling the model's influence to real-world proprieties, emulating a nuanced prediction vehicle capable of digesting diverse relational signals.

By pivoting towards graph-based forecasting models like this, businesses can mine deeper insights from their relational data lakes. This not only aids in fortifying future predictions but also in recognizing the layered narratives told by interconnected data, culminating in a richer, data-driven decision-making process.

**Summary of Discussion:**
