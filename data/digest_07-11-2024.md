### The sperm whale 'phonetic alphabet' revealed by AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240709-the-sperm-whale-phonetic-alphabet-revealed-by-ai) | 14 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40935076)

Researchers studying sperm whale communication have made an incredible discovery - they've found sophisticated structures in whale vocalizations similar to human language. These ocean giants are known for their complex social behavior and group decision-making, which rely on intricate communication skills.

Sperm whales live in multi-level, matrilineal societies where females and their offspring form close bonds, while males roam the oceans independently. The researchers have identified 156 distinct codas, or rhythmic sequences of clicks, used by sperm whales to communicate. By studying nearly 9,000 recordings, they unveiled a "sperm whale phonetic alphabet" - analogous to phonemes in human language.

Pratyusha Sharma, a PhD student at MIT involved in the study, highlighted the fine-grained changes in vocalizations detected by AI analysis. These include variations in tempo, rubato (speeding up and slowing down within a coda), and even ornamental additions like an extra click at the end of a vocalization. Such nuances suggest that sperm whale communication may convey a richer amount of information than previously understood.

This groundbreaking research sheds light on the intricate world of sperm whale communication, hinting at levels of complexity akin to human language. As technology and AI continue to decode animal communication, we may unlock even more secrets of the deep ocean and its inhabitants.

In the discussion, users made various comments related to the submission about sperm whale communication. One user noted that there were recent complaints about Long-Lived Maintenance Strategies (LLMs) trending with particular language inherently spoken by whales. Another user mentioned training whale sounds, possibly in reference to the study discussed. Lastly, a user brought up a historical event where whales were killed for industrial purposes, leading to the byproducts impacting the food chain ecosystem negatively. They also mentioned Japanese research, the Navy, and making contact with whales, ending the comment with a humorous remark about the situation being strange.
