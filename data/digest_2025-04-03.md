#### [Submission URL](https://www.dutchosintguy.com/post/the-slow-collapse-of-critical-thinking-in-osint-due-to-ai) | 377 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [201 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573465)

afford to lose that edge.

In an eye-opening blog post, a seasoned OSINT professional warns about the creeping reliance on Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini in open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations. The author recounts firsthand observations of analysts who progressively shift the cognitive load of their tasks—from translating documents and summarizing information to generating leads—onto AI. They caution that while AI can indeed streamline processes, excessive dependence on these tools leads to a dangerous erosion of critical thinking.

This concern isn't a baseless fear of new technology. The post references a significant 2025 study by Carnegie Mellon and Microsoft Research that found high reliance on AI diminishes critical thinking across various professions. This happens not because the users are lazy but because the sophisticated outputs of AI lend misplaced confidence, lulling professionals into a false sense of security about their analytical abilities.

The danger manifests in real-world OSINT scenarios, where analysts fall prey to AI-generated errors—errors they might have caught with their trained eyes. For instance, photo analyses misplace geographical contexts, profiles miss significant affiliations, and automated summaries overlook critical nuances in disinformation campaigns. These are not fringe mistakes but represent likely pitfalls in the daily workflow of OSINT practitioners.

The core message is a clarion call for the OSINT community: AI tools can be helpful allies but should never replace the fundamental skills of judgment and skepticism that define the profession. Analysts must remain vigilant, ensuring they don't become mere operators of automated systems but remain investigators capable of interpreting and questioning every piece of generated data.

The blog serves as a wake-up call for professionals and educators alike to ensure that, even as technology evolves, the core tenets of OSINT—critical thinking, skepticism, and rigorous validation—are preserved and passed down, securing the integrity of the craft.

The discussion revolves around the risks of over-reliance on AI in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and its impact on critical thinking. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Erosion of Critical Thinking**: Participants highlight concerns that tools like ChatGPT encourage analysts to offload cognitive tasks (e.g., translating documents, generating leads) to AI, leading to complacency. Overconfidence in AI’s polished outputs can result in overlooked errors, such as misattributed photos or missed nuances in disinformation campaigns.

2. **Cunningham’s Law Parallels**: Users compare AI reliance to Cunningham’s Law, where incorrect answers provoke corrections. However, AI’s authoritative tone may discourage users from questioning its outputs, creating a false sense of reliability. This fosters cognitive laziness, even if AI is "99.999% correct."

3. **Verification vs. Automation**: Many stress the importance of skepticism and cross-checking AI-generated conclusions. Reddit-style community verification (e.g., downvoting incorrect comments) contrasts with AI’s “instant answers,” which bypass critical scrutiny. Examples include the CIA’s OSIRIS system, where AI summarization could introduce errors if unchecked.

4. **Systemic vs. Individual Blame**: Some argue that blaming AI tools or users ignores systemic issues, such as inadequate training or institutional pressures to prioritize efficiency over rigor. Others note humans’ tendency to blame tools (like AI or social media) rather than address deeper societal or professional failings.

5. **Industry Examples and Analogies**: References to the CIA’s historical OSINT methods (e.g., Cold War radio monitoring) underscore the timeless need for human judgment. Comparisons to declining TV quality after adding “smart” features suggest AI might similarly degrade core analytical competencies if overused.

6. **Debate on AI’s Role**: While some view AI as a productivity tool, others warn against treating it as a replacement for expertise. The discussion acknowledges AI’s utility but emphasizes preserving foundational skills—training analysts to question outputs and maintain rigorous validation processes.

Overall, the conversation aligns with the blog’s warning: AI can enhance OSINT workflows but must not replace the critical thinking, skepticism, and methodological discipline that define the field.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/03/openai_copyright_bypass/) | 17 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43576724)

In a recent shake-up in the AI realm, Tim O'Reilly, the prominent mind behind tech publishing giant O'Reilly Media, accuses OpenAI of using his company's copyrighted books to train their state-of-the-art GPT-4o model without authorization. This claim surfaces amid ongoing legal battles implicating OpenAI's practices of employing copyrighted material for training their widely acknowledged GPT models without proper consent or financial remuneration.

The research, co-authored by O'Reilly, delves into the feeding habits of OpenAI's models, employing innovative testing methods to unravel their training secrets. The study employed DE-COP inference attacks to challenge GPT-4o with multiple-choice questions to identify verbatim excerpts from O'Reilly’s books, yielding results that hint at unauthorized training data usage. A striking AUROC score of 82% for GPT-4o suggests a notable likelihood of the model having been trained on O'Reilly Media books, suspected to have been sourced from the eyebrow-raising LibGen database—a notorious repository already linked with Meta's Llama models.

The findings underscore a concerning trend where non-public data increasingly fuels AI training, emphasizing urgent calls for transparency and licensing reforms. Failure to justly compensate content creators, as the researchers warn, could lead to a degradation of internet content quality—an enshittification scenario feared by digital purveyors.

Amidst these allegations and industry-wide finger-pointing, the AI sector has begun to ink licensing deals, with OpenAI securing data from Reddit and Time Magazine to curb reliance on sketchy web scraping practices. Nonetheless, OpenAI is also pushing for laxer copyright regulations, arguing that rigid rules stifle innovation and may allow China to outpace US developments.

While these controversies spur legal pursuits aplenty, they continue to stir the pot on the rightful use and compensation for AI training data, heralding a pivotal moment in the dialogue around the ethical and legal frameworks underscoring AI innovation.

The discussion revolves around Tim O'Reilly's accusations that OpenAI trained GPT-4o on his company's copyrighted books without permission. Key points from the comments include:

1. **Ethical and Legal Concerns**: Users debate whether AI training on copyrighted material constitutes theft, with comparisons made to grand-scale exploitation by wealthy entities. Some argue it undermines creators by flooding markets with AI-generated imitations, devaluing original work and reducing opportunities for artists.

2. **Impact on Creators**: Concerns are raised about AI models mimicking creators' styles, making it harder for artists to earn commissions. This "enshittification" of content could degrade quality and harm livelihoods.

3. **Regulation and Enforcement**: Questions arise about regional legal differences, such as whether companies can train on copyrighted data in China. Others critique enforcement bodies (e.g., BSA, MPAA) for inaction and call for stricter regulations or licensing frameworks.
