### Short-term Hebbian learning can implement transformer-like attention

#### [Submission URL](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1011843) | 46 points | by [tester89](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tester89) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39584454)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers have proposed a new neural mechanism, the "match-and-control principle," demonstrating how neurons can mimic the attention-like computations found in Transformer models used in machine learning. By leveraging short-term, Hebbian synaptic potentiation, neurons can compare spike trains to perform hundreds of key comparisons per query, similar to the operations in Transformer models. This work sheds light on the potential connections between advanced machine learning models and neuroscientific principles, offering insights into how the brain might perform complex computations. The study, published in PLOS Computational Biology by Ian T. Ellwood, showcases the power and limitations of this innovative approach. The detailed research findings and code are publicly available for further exploration.

The discussion on the submission includes various perspectives on the study proposing the "match-and-control principle" as a neural mechanism that demonstrates similarities to Transformer models used in machine learning. 

- **light_hue_1** pointed out that the paper overpromises by claiming that Hebbian learning can rapidly induce synaptic weight changes akin to Transformer attention mechanisms. They mentioned that the brain does not work in the same way and that the comparison fallacies with Transformer mechanisms in the brain are inaccurate due to different time scales and random factors present in neural function. They acknowledged that the paper offers some valuable insights on how a network could work but falls short of accurately representing brain processes.

- **JPLeRouzic** expressed interest in the paper, finding the intersection between neuroscience and computer science intriguing, even though they noted imperfect observations and variations in neural networks when compared to Transformers.

- **dmnmck** highlighted a surprising paper about Hopfield Networks that also involves Hebbian learning, providing a link for reference.

### "AI will cure cancer" misunderstands both AI and medicine

#### [Submission URL](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-02-20-ai-medicine/) | 146 points | by [pratnala](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pratnala) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39582541)

In the world of AI and healthcare, remarkable strides have been made, from detecting Parkinson's disease through retinal images to predicting hospital readmissions. However, there are concerns about the practical impact these advancements will have on patients. A recent late-night debate highlighted the conflicting views on AI safety, with one optimistic statement standing out: "AI will cure cancer." While this optimism is widespread, there are reservations about the true implications for healthcare.

Two core issues surrounding AI in medicine are the disregard for patient perspectives and the exacerbation of inequality, with claims of AI curing cancer sometimes being seen as mere marketing slogans. Automated decision-making processes powered by AI are increasingly influencing critical aspects of people's lives, such as determining job opportunities, housing access, and healthcare provision. Disturbing patterns have emerged, where errors made by AI systems can have devastating consequences for individuals, leading to hunger, unjust debts, and reduced medical care.

The use of AI in decision-making systems often prioritizes increasing revenues over ensuring fairness and accuracy, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations. This trend reflects a historical pattern of surveillance being leveraged against vulnerable groups. Automation bias, where people trust computers over humans, further complicates the situation, making it harder to identify errors in AI-driven decisions. These systems often lack mechanisms for error correction, participant involvement, and providing redress for those harmed.

Even in the medical field, advancements in AI may not address fundamental issues within the healthcare system, as seen in the personal experience of neurologist Ilene Ruhoy, who faced delays in diagnosis and treatment for a brain tumor due to skepticism from colleagues. These examples underscore the importance of not just advancing AI capabilities but also addressing systemic issues within healthcare that AI alone cannot resolve.

Discussion Summary:

- There is a debate on the practicality of AI making healthcare more proactive in cancer detection. The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of regular screenings versus targeted screenings for high-risk populations and the potential harm caused by unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis.

- The importance of understanding the various types of cancer and detecting specific cancers early is emphasized, as early detection can significantly impact treatment outcomes. There are differing opinions on whether detecting cancers early leads to better outcomes or if it leads to unnecessary treatments due to overdiagnosis.

- The discussion also touches on the potential of AI in improving the accuracy of cancer screenings by reducing false positives and negatives. However, there are concerns about the limitations of AI in interpreting variables and the need for further improvements in cancer diagnostics.

- The debate extends to the role of AI in healthcare beyond cancer detection, with some highlighting the importance of AI in accelerating treatment and drug development processes. The discussion underscores the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare but also raises questions about its practical implications and the need to address systemic issues within the healthcare system.
