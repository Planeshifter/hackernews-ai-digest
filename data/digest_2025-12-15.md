### It seems that OpenAI is scraping [certificate transparency] logs

#### [Submission URL](https://benjojo.co.uk/u/benjojo/h/Gxy2qrCkn1Y327Y6D3) | 210 points | by [pavel_lishin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pavel_lishin) | [105 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46274478)

Title: New cert, instant crawl: CT logs likely seeding OpenAI’s bot

- A user minted a fresh TLS certificate and, seconds later, saw a GET /robots.txt hit on the new subdomain from “OAI-SearchBot/1.3” (OpenAI’s crawler UA).  
- Suggests OpenAI is monitoring Certificate Transparency (CT) logs to discover new hostnames—something many bots have done for years.  
- Proposed “hash-the-domain” CT designs were pushed back on: CT’s purpose is public, third‑party auditability of issuance; hiding names would weaken that.  
- Consensus: domain names aren’t secrets. If hostname secrecy matters, don’t rely on it—use wildcards, private PKI, or keep sensitive services off publicly trusted certs.  
- Side thread: skepticism about DNSSEC/NSEC3 for typical web use, and the perennial tension between transparency and domain enumeration.  
- Takeaway: Treat CT as a public broadcast. New certs can trigger near‑instant discovery and crawling; expect your robots.txt to be fetched immediately.

The discussion focused on the fact that Certificate Transparency (CT) log monitoring is a standard, widely known practice rather than a novel discovery. Commenters noted that a diverse range of actors—from Google and the Internet Archive to security firms and "script kiddies"—have tracked these logs for years to index the web or find vulnerabilities.

Key points include:

*   **Expected Behavior:** Ideally, CT logs are *intended* to be consumed; users argued that specialized crawlers (like OpenAI's) using them to bootstrap discovery is a logical use case, not necessarily a security overstep.
*   **Tooling Issues:** A significant portion of the thread complained about the unreliability of `crt.sh` (a popular CT search tool), leading to suggestions for alternatives like Merklemap and Sunlight for faster, more stable queries.
*   **Privacy & Architecture:** The community reiterated that "public means public." If distinct internal subdomains are sensitive, users should utilize wildcard certificates or private Certificate Authorities (CAs) rather than relying on obscure hostnames with public certs.
*   **Knowledge Gaps:** While some dismissed the post as "boring" (or "yawn"-worthy), others defended it as a necessary realization for developers encountering the "lucky 10,000" phenomenon—learning for the first time how tightly coupled HTTPS security is to public domain announcement.

### If AI replaces workers, should it also pay taxes?

#### [Submission URL](https://english.elpais.com/technology/2025-11-30/if-ai-replaces-workers-should-it-also-pay-taxes.html) | 570 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [935 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268709)

AI’s profit boom revives the “robot tax” debate: if machines replace workers, who pays?

- Big Tech is pouring record profits into AI while announcing layoffs (Amazon, Meta, UPS). With most public revenue tied to labor taxes, policymakers worry automation could shrink the tax base.
- Proposals resurface: Edmund Phelps and Bill Gates once floated a “robot tax.” But many economists warn it’s hard to define what counts as a robot/AI and could distort innovation.
- Brookings’ Sanjay Patnaik: don’t tax AI directly; instead, raise capital gains taxes to address risks and revenue loss.
- IMF: also advises against AI-specific taxes, but suggests rebalancing toward capital—higher capital taxes, possible excess-profits levies, and revisiting innovation incentives that may displace workers.
- Labor-market outlook is mixed. Goldman Sachs sees AI lifting global GDP by ~7% over a decade; the IMF sees up to 0.8 pp annual growth through 2030. The ILO says 1 in 4 workers are exposed, with most jobs transformed rather than destroyed.
- Oxford’s Carl Frey: tax systems have shifted toward labor and away from capital, nudging firms toward automation; rebalancing is key to support job-creating tech.
- Stockholm’s Daniel Waldenström: no clear rise in unemployment; keep taxing labor, consumption, and capital—no special AI tax.
- Context: OECD corporate tax rates fell from 33% (2000) to ~25% today, while workers’ tax wedges barely budged. Amazon exemplifies the tension: +38% profits and major AI spend alongside 14,000 layoffs.
- Robotics industry (IFR) rejects ad hoc taxes, arguing automation boosts productivity and jobs; warns against taxing “production tools” instead of profits.

Why it matters: Governments must shore up revenues without smothering productivity. The emerging consensus: skip a robot tax, but rebalance away from labor and toward capital to align incentives with broad-based job growth. Open question: how to do that without chilling innovation.

Here is the summary of the discussion based on the provided text:

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion centers on the tension between funding societal infrastructure and the economic mechanics of automation, with a general consensus that while the current tax system fails to capture value from AI and capital accumulation, a specific "robot tax" may be the wrong solution.

**Capital, Labor, and Tax Strategy**
There is broad agreement that capital owners currently avoid funding the state’s social systems (safety, infrastructure, research) compared to wage earners. However, commenters argue that implementing a specific "robot tax" is a knee-jerk reaction or a "sci-fi distraction."
*   **Alternative Proposals:** Instead of taxing "robots," participants suggest taxing capital gains and wealth more effectively. One line of reasoning argues that the distinction between "robots" and standard capital equipment is arbitrary; therefore, general capital taxation is more appropriate.
*   **Corporate vs. Individual Tax:** A debate emerged regarding corporate tax rates. Some users argued for eliminating corporate income tax entirely—viewing it as "deadweight loss"—and instead taxing distributions (dividends/income) to individuals at higher rates.
*   **The "Corporate Shell" Loophole:** Critics of eliminating corporate tax pointed out that business owners would simply hoard wealth within the corporation, claiming personal expenses (cars, rent) as business costs or taking loans against corporate assets to avoid realizing taxable income.

**Friction vs. Redistribution**
A philosophical debate arose regarding the economic impact of taxation:
*   **The Innovation Argument:** Some argued that taxes create "friction" that slows automation. Since automation theoretically lowers costs and increases living standards, slowing it down contradicts the goal of societal improvement.
*   **The "Trickle-Down" Critique:** Counter-arguments noted that productivity gains have not historically trickled down to real wages since the 1970s. From this view, "friction" (taxation) represents necessary societal consent and cost internalization to prevent monopolies and rent-seeking behavior.

**Compensation and Healthcare**
The conversation diverted into why real wages appear stagnant. Some commenters claimed that total compensation *has* risen if employer-sponsored healthcare premiums are included. Others rebutted this, arguing that the US healthcare system is inefficient and inflated; therefore, rising premiums represent a transfer of wealth to the medical industry rather than increased real value or purchasing power for the worker. Several users suggested decoupling healthcare from employment entirely to improve labor mobility.

### Microsoft Copilot AI Comes to LG TVs, and Can't Be Deleted

#### [Submission URL](https://www.techpowerup.com/344075/microsoft-copilot-ai-comes-to-lg-tvs-and-cant-be-deleted) | 297 points | by [akyuu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=akyuu) | [301 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268844)

Microsoft Copilot lands on LG webOS TVs — and you can’t remove it (report)

A Reddit user says a recent LG webOS update added Microsoft’s Copilot app to their TV with no uninstall option. What the app actually does on a TV isn’t clear, but it mirrors Microsoft’s broader push to put Copilot everywhere, moving beyond PCs and into living rooms. Rollout appears to vary by region/model: some users say they’ve had it for months; others in the EU report not seeing it.

Why it matters
- Forced bundling on “smart” TVs revives long‑running bloatware and privacy concerns, especially when apps can’t be deleted.
- LG’s “Live Plus” feature (Automatic Content Recognition) can scan what’s on screen to personalize recommendations and ads. LG says you can disable it in Settings > All Settings > General > Additional Settings (wording varies by model).
- Commenters predict regulatory scrutiny in the EU and vent broader frustration with TV OSes that are slow, ad‑laden, and hard to control.

What you can do
- Disable Live Plus/ACR, voice assistants, and ad personalization in settings.
- Keep the TV off the internet or put it on a restricted VLAN/guest network.
- Use an external streaming box you control; consider DNS/ad‑blocking.
- If shopping, look for models with “dumb” modes or better app control.

HN discussion: 117 comments, with themes of privacy, unwanted AI bundling, and whether TVs should be treated more like neutral displays than ad platforms.

Here is a summary of the Hacker News discussion:

**Isolate the TV, Upgrade the Box**
The overwhelming consensus among commenters is to treat modern smart TVs solely as "dumb" monitors. The most common advice is to never connect the TV panel to the internet to prevent data collection and forced updates (like the Copilot one). Instead, users recommend relying entirely on external hardware for streaming.

**The Hardware Debate**
*   **Apple TV:** Highly recommended as the "mainstream" option; users argue that the higher hardware cost pays for a premium, ad-free experience, as opposed to the data-subsidized business models of Roku, Fire TV, and Chromecast.
*   **Nvidia Shield:** Remains a favorite among enthusiasts for its performance and codec support (like 4K/AI upscaling), though many expressed frustration that the hardware hasn't been refreshed since 2019.
*   **Custom Launchers:** For those stuck with Android/Google TV based devices, commenters suggested replacing the default ad-laden interface with third-party launchers like **Projectivity Launcher** or **Flauncher** to strip away bloatware and tracking.

**Paranoia and Philosophy**
A thread of discussion formed around the fear that keeping a TV "offline" might not be enough, with some speculating that manufacturers might eventually embed cellular modems or use open Wi-Fi networks to exfiltrate data (though others dismissed this as currently cost-prohibitive). Finally, a philosophical debate broke out regarding the decline of TV as a "shared cultural experience," arguing that algorithmic recommendations have isolated viewers into niches, destroying the communal aspect of broadcast television.

### Nvidia Nemotron 3 Family of Models

#### [Submission URL](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/nemotron/Nemotron-3/) | 55 points | by [ewt-nv](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ewt-nv) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46275111)

NVIDIA debuts Nemotron 3: an “open” family of efficient agentic AI models with 1M-token context — Nano ships today

What’s new
- Three-tier lineup: Nano (small/efficient), Super (for collaborative agents, IT ops), Ultra (SOTA reasoning). Nano is available now; Super and Ultra arrive in coming months.
- Architecture: Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Mixture-of-Experts for high throughput; larger models add LatentMoE and Multi-Token Prediction; trained with NVFP4; long-context up to 1M tokens; RL-based post-training across diverse environments; inference-time “reasoning budget” control.

Nano highlights
- Size: 3.2B active (3.6B with embeddings), 31.6B total params (MoE), tuned for low-cost inference.
- Performance: Claims higher accuracy than GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-30B-A3B on popular benchmarks; 1M-token context and stronger RULER scores across lengths.
- Throughput: On a single H200 (8K in / 16K out), 3.3× Qwen3-30B-A3B and 2.2× GPT-OSS-20B.

Open release today
- Weights: FP8 quantized and BF16 post-trained Nano; BF16 base model; plus the GenRM used for RLHF.
- Data: Massive new corpora including 2.5T English tokens from curated Common Crawl (with synthetic rephrasing/translation), 428B CC-derived code tokens (equation/code preserving, LaTeX-standardized), refreshed curated GitHub code, specialized STEM/scientific coding sets, and new SFT/RL datasets.
- Recipes: Full training/post-training pipelines via the NVIDIA Nemotron developer repo; white paper and Nano technical report.

Why it matters
Nemotron 3 targets agentic/reasoning-heavy workloads with MoE efficiency (small active params, big total capacity), ultra-long context, and tunable inference costs—aiming to beat mid-size baselines while being cheaper to run. Independent validations and license specifics will be key to watch as Super/Ultra roll out.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Real-World Performance and Use Cases**
Users engaged in high-volume data processing (ETL) and analysis for venture capital workflows reported that NVIDIA’s smaller models are outperforming competitors. One user noted that for tasks requiring strict compliance, tool calling, and low hallucinations, these models beat Llama 3 and other open-weight models under 125B parameters. Several participants highlighted the cost-effectiveness of the release, noting that the models are currently accessible for free with generous limits via OpenRouter.

**Technical Architecture and Release Quality**
The discussion praised NVIDIA’s "Day 0" availability of training recipes and datasets, though one user noted a broken link for the SFT data. Technical conversation focused on the Hybrid MoE architecture and 1M token context; however, a clarification was made regarding quantization: while the upcoming Super and Ultra models are native FP4, the currently released Nano model was not pretrained in FP4.

**Licensing and Hardware Comparisons**
Users expressed relief regarding the licensing terms, pivoting to Nemotron now that it appears viable for commercial settings compared to previous restricted releases. Comparisons were drawn to high-speed inference providers like Cerebras and Groq, with some debate over whether Cerebras would eventually support this architecture given their current limited model list. A dissenting voice offered skepticism, dismissing the announcement as "misleading benchmarks."
