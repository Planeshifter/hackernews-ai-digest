### Lessons after a Half-billion GPT Tokens

#### [Submission URL](https://kenkantzer.com/lessons-after-a-half-billion-gpt-tokens/) | 44 points | by [lordofmoria](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lordofmoria) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40015185)

In a recent blog post by Ken Kantzer, the CTO of Truss, he shared some insights after processing over 500 million GPT tokens for their startup. Here are some key takeaways:

Lesson 1: Less is more when it comes to prompts. Ken discovered that being less specific in prompts often led to better results as GPT performed well when given vague instructions. For example, asking GPT to simply provide the full name of a state instead of specifying detailed instructions improved performance.

Lesson 2: Ken found that using just the chat API from OpenAI was sufficient for their needs, highlighting that additional features like langchain were unnecessary. Keeping it simple with a single function for extracting JSON data proved to be effective.

Lesson 3: Implementing a streaming API and displaying variable-speed typed characters to users improved the user experience significantly, showcasing the potential of this approach as a UX innovation.

Lesson 4: GPT struggled with returning nothing if it couldn't find relevant information, often opting to hallucinate rather than providing a blank output. This led to instances where GPT generated random bakery names when faced with empty text blocks.

Overall, Ken's experiences shed light on optimizing the use of GPT models for text-based tasks, emphasizing the importance of effective prompts and keeping the workflow straightforward for better outcomes.

The discussion on the Hacker News post delves into different aspects of the insights shared by Ken Kantzer from Truss regarding their experience with processing GPT tokens. Here are some key points raised by the community:

### Cipherleaks is the first demonstrated attack against AMD SEV-SNP (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://cipherleaks.com/) | 36 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40016468)

Today on Hacker News, the spotlight is on CIPHERLEAKs, the first attack demonstrated against AMD SEV-SNP. This attack leverages a vulnerability in the design of SEV's memory encryption to breach the constant-time RSA and ECDSA implementation in the latest OpenSSL library, using the ciphertext of the encrypted VM Save Area as side channels. By monitoring changes in the ciphertext, attackers can infer changes in the corresponding plaintext, enabling them to breach encryption methods.

The root causes of this vulnerability lie in two features of SEV: the use of XOR-Encrypt-XOR (XEX) encryption mode with a fixed entropy tweak function that leads to the same plaintext having the same ciphertext, and the lack of prevention of the hypervisor from accessing the ciphertext of the encrypted memory, creating a ciphertext side channel.

Two case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the CIPHERLEAKs attack, showing that the private keys of RSA encryption and secret nonces in ECDSA signatures can be recovered with 100% accuracy.

The CIPHERLEAKs attack has been disclosed to AMD, who has acknowledged the vulnerability and filed an embargo until August 10, 2021, with a CVE number assigned to the vulnerability. AMD has also announced a security bulletin and a hardware patch for SEV-SNP in August 2021 to address the issue.

For more details, the research paper on CIPHERLEAKs can be accessed to understand the full extent of the attack. Researchers involved in this discovery include individuals from The Ohio State University, Baidu Security, and NIO Security Research.

This exploit affects all SEV, SEV-ES, and SEV-SNP supported by AMD EPYC server processors, and the vulnerability has been reserved under the CVE number CVE-2020-12966.

SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is an AMD Virtualization extension that provides security features for virtual machines, while SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging) is a recent addition aimed at protecting against attacks exploiting memory integrity flaws.

As software solutions may not be effective due to collection of function's internal state by Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), hardware-level patches from AMD are expected to mitigate the CIPHERLEAKs attack.

The discussion on the CIPHERLEAKs submission includes various points:

1. **H8crilA** mentions exchanging information about side-channel solutions involving various kinds of steps in response to the vulnerability demonstrated in CIPHERLEAKs. They talk about Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Clouds, the FBI vs Apple encryption dispute, corporate staff meetings being hacked with malware, and the distrust towards DRM and anti-cheating mechanisms. They point out the importance of controlling privileged kernel code and utilize Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) as a potential solution.

2. **the8472** notes that Intel has discontinued desktop chips that use Software Binary Player Digital Rights Management (DRM) with SGX, emphasizing a shift in their technology focus.

3. **stypc** appreciates the addition of the 2021 tag to the submission.

4. **tus666** brings up the frustration around highly annoying exclusive domain names registered for individual CVEs. **frgmd** discusses human psychology and how certain domain names evoke emotional responses, highlighting the impact they can have indirectly. **mistrial9** dives into the visibility and costs associated with domain names, expressing concerns about the vanity aspect and how it can lead to various manipulations and complications in the cybersecurity domain. **xnthr** suggests pricing domain names at $30 per year or less to deter vanity exploitation. **sqgz** mentions a price of $10 per year for domain names.
