### Positron, a New Data Science IDE

#### [Submission URL](https://posit.co/blog/positron-product-announcement-aug-2025/) | 135 points | by [kgwgk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kgwgk) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44951862)

Posit launches Positron, a free, cross‑language data‑science IDE aimed at teams working in both Python and R. Built on Code OSS (the open-core behind VS Code) but shipped under Elastic License 2.0 (source‑available, not OSI‑approved), Positron packages notebook-style exploration and production workflows in one desktop app. The 2025.08.0 release is their second stable build after 2+ years of development; Posit Workbench will soon offer Positron sessions, and RStudio will continue to be maintained.

Why it matters
- A purpose-built alternative to VS Code/JupyterLab for data science that treats Python and R as first‑class citizens, reflecting how modern teams actually work.
- Tight integration with the Posit ecosystem (Quarto, Shiny, Posit Connect) lowers friction from exploration to deployment.
- Extension-friendly via Open VSX while adding data‑science‑centric UI (variable explorer, plot pane, multi-session consoles).

Highlights
- Cohesive workflows: notebooks, scripts, consoles, Quarto docs, and data apps in one workspace.
- Data tooling: Variable/Data Frame Explorer with filtering/summaries; Plot Pane with history/export; Database pane for browsing/querying SQL sources.
- App + API dev: One‑click run/debug for Shiny, Streamlit, Dash, and FastAPI; push‑button deploy to Posit Connect or git-backed flows.
- Multi-language by design: Easy interpreter/environment switching (R and Python today; room for SQL later); project templates using uv (Python) and renv (R).
- Extensible editor: Based on Code OSS with support for thousands of VSIX extensions from Open VSX.
- Built‑in AI: Positron Assistant (public preview) uses Anthropic models and IDE context (session variables, plots) for Q&A, completions, and debugging; more model providers planned.
- Availability: Free desktop app for Windows/macOS/Linux under ELv2; migration guides for VS Code and RStudio users; RStudio remains supported.

Bottom line: Positron aims to be a “best of both worlds” IDE—RStudio’s data‑science ergonomics plus VS Code’s extensibility—while unifying Python and R workflows and smoothing the path from notebook to deploy. The main trade‑off: it’s source‑available (ELv2), not fully open source.

The discussion around Positron's launch reflects a mix of optimism about its integrated workflow and skepticism about its licensing and practicality. Key points include:

1. **Licensing Concerns**: Many users debate whether Positron’s Elastic License 2.0 (source-available but not OSI-approved) truly qualifies as open source. Critics argue it imposes commercial restrictions, while others acknowledge the practical trade-off for accessing Posit’s tailored tools.

2. **Extension Ecosystem vs. Forking**: While some question why Posit forked VS Code instead of building extensions, developers explain that core data-science features (language services, UI panels, workflows) couldn’t be achieved via extensions alone. Critics highlight maintenance challenges and potential fragmentation.

3. **Feature Gaps**: Users note missing functionalities:
   - **Inline plots in Quarto documents**, crucial for data reporting, are absent but under consideration.
   - **Julia/Jupyter support** isn’t emphasized, raising doubts about broader language compatibility.
   - **Stability issues**, such as sudden crashes or unresponsive consoles, are frustrating for early adopters.

4. **User Experience**: 
   - RStudio loyalists face a learning curve (muscle memory, keyboard shortcuts), though migration guides ease this.
   - VS Code users appreciate Positron’s data-centric tools (variable explorer, multi-session consoles) but wonder if switching is worthwhile given VSCode’s extensibility.

5. **Comparisons to Alternatives**: 
   - Positron is likened to Spyder or “Spyder + Cursor” for Python users, while PyCharm and MATLAB are cited as MATLAB-like alternatives.
   - Some prefer sticking with RStudio or Jupyter for niche workflows (e.g., Quarto/RMarkdown integration).

6. **AI Integration**: Positron Assistant’s use of Anthropic models receives mild interest, but users express broader skepticism about AI’s role in coding assistance.

**Overall**: Positron is seen as a promising but imperfect unification of R/Python workflows. Its success hinges on addressing stability issues, expanding language support, and convincing users to adopt a source-available tool over open-source staples like VS Code or RStudio.

### Docker container for running Claude Code in "dangerously skip permissions" mode

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/tintinweb/claude-code-container) | 12 points | by [Luc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Luc) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44956002)

Claude Code in a box: run it “skip permissions” style, with optional MCP servers

What it is
- A Dockerized setup to run Claude Code with permission prompts disabled (“dangerously skip permissions”), plus an example image that pre-wires Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.
- Two variants: a clean standalone container, and a “with-MCP” example (e.g., Chonky Security Tools) showing how to add and auto-trust MCP servers.

Why it matters
- Makes Claude Code runs reproducible and automatable (useful for CI or batch analyses) without interactive trust prompts.
- Wraps the tool in a constrained container so you can point it at a read-only codebase and capture outputs deterministically.

How it works
- Workspace layout inside the container:
  - input: read-only mount of your current dir
  - output: writable results
  - data: optional read-only reference data
  - temp: tmpfs
  - .claude: project settings
  - mcp-servers: installed MCPs (example config included)
- Security posture: non-root user, dropped Linux capabilities, PID cap, tmpfs for /tmp, bridge network, no-new-privileges. Counterbalanced by “Jailfree” mode that auto-trusts the workspace and grants broad tool access for full automation.
- Requires a Claude Code OAuth token (sk-…) via env var; simple build.sh and run_claude.sh scripts; optional --debug and --mcp-debug flags. A debug shell script is included.

Caveats
- “Skip permissions” and auto-trusted MCPs increase blast radius—use against read-only inputs, isolate outputs, and keep tokens safe.
- You still need a valid Claude Code license/token; this repo just packages the environment.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion:

1. **Docker vs. Native Sandboxing**:  
   User nkvdp raises a concern about Docker's stability on macOS and advocates for native sandboxing alternatives like Bubblewrap on Linux. They mention transitioning away from Docker and share their own CLI tool ([github.com/nikvdp/cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco)) as an example of leveraging simpler sandboxing methods.

2. **Safety Debate**:  
   dvnhgr questions whether the setup is safe, to which the implication is that security depends on use-case constraints (like read-only inputs).

3. **Practical Implementations**:  
   jshchnz jokes about having "literally built this project last week," with a follow-up from tgh referencing CLI tools ("screen-runner" / binary images), suggesting interest in lightweight automation approaches.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion highlights a trend toward favoring Linux-native sandboxing over Docker for stability, alongside security-conscious design considerations for AI code execution environments.
