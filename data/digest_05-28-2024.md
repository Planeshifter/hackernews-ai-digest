### My computer has an underscore in its name, and I have trouble with the network

#### [Submission URL](https://kb.iu.edu/d/afqs) | 63 points | by [amelius](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amelius) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40499260)

The use of an underscore (_) in a computer's name can cause difficulties in accessing network services due to it not being a legal character for hostnames. According to RFC 822, only alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9), hyphens (-), and periods (.) are permitted in hostnames. An underscore can lead to issues such as being unable to send emails to specific hosts or access Usenet newsgroups. Changing the computer's name to comply with the valid characters is the recommended solution to resolve these problems.

The discussion includes various perspectives on the challenges related to using an underscore (_) in computer hostnames. Users discuss issues encountered with incompatible characters in hostnames, such as difficulties in accessing network services. The conversation covers topics like DNS server configurations, historical Windows naming conventions, reminiscences of memorable hostnames, and technical aspects of hostname standards and their impact on interoperability. Some users also delve into the implications of underscore usage in hostnames with relation to protocols like SMTP and DNS conventions. Additionally, there are mentions of nostalgic experiences with naming conventions and the significance of adhering to standardized naming practices for network compatibility.
