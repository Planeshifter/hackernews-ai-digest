#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/May/11/delimiters-wont-save-you/) | 189 points | by [eiiot](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eiiot) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35911595)

OpenAI introduced ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, a new video course to teach developers about prompt engineering. The course discusses various topics, from fundamentals to real-life examples such as summarization and text generation. However, it also includes a brief section about prompt injection, which experts say is a poorly understood and difficult problem to solve. The course proposes using delimiters to mark the start and end of untrusted user input, but this method is very easily defeated, as attackers have an effectively unlimited set of options for confusing the model with a sequence of tokens that subverts the original prompt.

OpenAI released a new video course on ChatGPT prompt engineering for developers that covers several topics, from fundamentals to real-life applications such as summarization and text generation. However, the course also mentions the poorly understood problem of prompt injection and proposes a delimiter approach to mitigate it, which experts say is easily defeated. The comments discuss various solutions, including segregating data and implementing support for prompt post-processing, but with limited success. They also suggest focusing on prompt detection by applying Prompt Application Firewalls to prevent malicious injection attempts. Many contributors state that prompt injection is a fundamental and difficult problem to solve, given the nature of language models, and will require considerable research and experimentation to address effectively.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/ai-like-chatgpt-are-no-good-at-not-20230512/) | 122 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [123 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35923651)

As language models and chatbots become more sophisticated, they still struggle with negation. While these models excel at predicting likely combinations of text, they are not equivalent to the task of understanding. Recent studies aimed to understand these difficulties and find ways for programmers to get around them, but researchers still don't understand whether machines can ever truly understand the concept of negation or the word "no." As LLMs continue to scale and perform astonishingly, this remains a fundamental challenge that needs to be addressed.

This post discusses the struggles of language models and chatbots with negation and whether machines can truly understand the concept of "no." The comments discuss various examples of animals and their limbs, such as bats and their wings/paws/claws, and whether these can be classified as paws or not. The discussion also includes debates over the definition of terms and the validity of the article. In general, the comments highlight the limitations and challenges of language models compared to human cognition.

Experts are warning that AI-generated content is spreading rapidly across the web, with anyone able to use language software to generate large amounts of prose on almost any topic. Tech investor Jonathan Greenglass claims that if users have an internet connection, they have consumed AI-generated content. This alleged rise in AI-written content could be dangerous for consumers, as more "misinformation" and manipulation surfaces on the web. Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI start-up Hugging Face, has warned that “The main issue is losing track of what truth is."

The submission discusses how experts have warned about the rapid spread of AI-generated content across the web. This rise in AI-written content is dangerous for consumers, as it might spread "misinformation" and manipulation in larger amounts. The comments discuss various aspects of the issue, including verifying the authenticity of digital content, the possibility of verifying human-produced text, fact-checking, the impact of AI on email communication, the challenges in establishing truth and trust sources in technical subjects, and the limitations of AI-generated content. Some commenters express concern over AI replacing the creativity and knowledge of human writers, while others see it as an opportunity to improve the quality of content.
