#### [Submission URL](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/05/05/ai-spam-websites-books-chatgpt/) | 157 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [158 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35919753)

Experts are warning that AI-generated content is spreading rapidly across the web, with anyone able to use language software to generate large amounts of prose on almost any topic. Tech investor Jonathan Greenglass claims that if users have an internet connection, they have consumed AI-generated content. This alleged rise in AI-written content could be dangerous for consumers, as more "misinformation" and manipulation surfaces on the web. Margaret Mitchell, chief ethics scientist at the AI start-up Hugging Face, has warned that “The main issue is losing track of what truth is."

The comments discuss various aspects of the issue, including verifying the authenticity of digital content, the possibility of verifying human-produced text, fact-checking, the impact of AI on email communication, the challenges in establishing truth and trust sources in technical subjects, and the limitations of AI-generated content. Some commenters express concern over AI replacing the creativity and knowledge of human writers, while others see it as an opportunity to improve the quality of content. Many discuss the role of capitalism and incentives in the proliferation of AI-generated content.

### A RP2040 Powered MIDI-Controlled Synth in CircuitPython

#### [Submission URL](https://gist.github.com/todbot/96a654c5fa27625147d65c45c8bfd47b) | 73 points | by [_Microft](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_Microft) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35921745)

Today's top story on Hacker News is a project shared by user todbot. The project is a MIDI-controlled synthesizer implemented using CircuitPython and uses a cheap PCM5102 DAC on QTPY RP2040. The synth has a couple of features, such as midi velocity controlling attack rate, notes having small random detune on all oscillators to reduce phase stacking, adjustable number of detuned oscillators per note, five selectable waveforms, and vibrato depth on the mod wheel. The code for the synth is also available on Github and is implemented using ulab.numpy for signal processing. A video demo of this cool project is available on Youtube.

People in the comments are excited about the project and its affordability, with some suggesting alternative models such as the Teensy. Another user shares a similar project that implements a MIDI keyboard using Raspberry Pi Pico. A user named "_benj" shared his experience of playing around with an RP2040 and creating a digital piano analyzer that can make a small buzzer beep at the appropriate frequency of a MIDI signal. There's also a discussion about the creator todbot's blog.

### Faster CPython at PyCon, part two

#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/931197/56e7c3d8a352d8bc/) | 73 points | by [jwilk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jwilk) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35919942)

At PyCon 2023 in Salt Lake City, Utah, Mark Shannon provided an overall picture of CPython optimizations, including efforts made over the last decade or more, with an eye towards other areas that have been optimized, such as the memory layout for the internal C data structures of the interpreter. Shannon talked about the guiding principles of the Faster CPython project to improve Python's performance and emphasized the importance of efficient and compact data structures that require fewer memory reads. He also explained how the size of Python objects was reduced to less than half of the original 352 bytes in Python 2.7 with the addition of compact dictionaries in Python 3.6, thereby improving performance by utilizing faster memory.

The comments discussed the speed improvements in Python 3.12 as well as the use of C-xtnsns and CFFI to improve performance. There was also a discussion on the trade-offs between speed and Python's dynamically typed nature. It was mentioned that the reduction in memory overhead for Python objects was discussed in an LWN article. Furthermore, Dropbox's switch from Python to Golang was discussed, and there was a suggestion to use Numpy for intensive computation instead of Python.

### EVA: AI-Relational Database System

#### [Submission URL](https://evadb.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) | 106 points | by [jonbaer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jonbaer) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35913173)

EVA is an open-source AI-relational database system that supports AI-powered applications on structured and unstructured data with the help of deep learning models. It contains built-in models for analyzing unstructured data such as image classification, object detection, OCR, face detection, and more. EVA's features include supporting user-defined functions, caching, sampling, cost-based operator reordering, and an AI-oriented query language. The database system is fully implemented in Python and licensed under the Apache license. It simplifies computer vision tasks and supports custom deep learning models. Check out the illustrative applications of EVA including traffic analysis, MNIST digit recognition, movie analysis, and more.

In the comments section, several users had a discussion about the differences between EVA and MindsDB, a comment about EVA's SQL-like syntax, the need for benchmarking, and how documentation for EVA compares to various other database and storage systems. Additionally, some users commented on the concept of relational databases being too archaic for humans and how certain database concepts differ from models of the human cognitive system.

### Apple Silicon Macs now natively support Unreal Engine 5

#### [Submission URL](https://www.engadget.com/apple-silicon-macs-now-natively-support-unreal-engine-5-124257710.html) | 40 points | by [PeterCorless](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PeterCorless) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35918061)

Apple Silicon Mac users can now take advantage of the latest version of Epic Games' popular 3D world-building tool, Unreal Engine 5. The new update, version 5.2, is the first to work natively on Apple's ARM-based chips, eliminating the need for Rosetta technology. Unreal Engine 5 is ideal for gaming and virtual production, and the new iPad app that accompanies it offers a touch-based interface for lighting, color grading, and other tasks on virtual sets. The update also includes a "Procedural Content Generation framework" and Substrate, which allows for more controlled material creation in real-time applications.

Some users discussed the compatibility of Unreal with different platforms; a few users pointed to the support for Linux in Unreal and how this can be beneficial for developers. Others discussed the Apple Silicon architecture and how it impacts game development, with some pointing out that the current implementation of Unreal for Apple Silicon may not be completely native. The discussion also touched upon the technical aspects of Unreal, including its support for Metal graphics API and other features like Nanite. Additionally, some users talked about the relationship between Epic and Apple, particularly due to Epic's ongoing legal dispute with Apple.
