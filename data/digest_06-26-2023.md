### Android’s emergency call shortcut is flooding dispatchers with false calls

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/06/uk-police-blame-android-for-record-number-of-false-emergency-calls/) | 177 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [188 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36479440)

Police forces in the UK are reporting a “record number” of false emergency calls due to Android’s easy-access emergency call feature which was added to Android 12. By pressing the power button five times, a user can accidentally trigger the emergency services and as the feature started rolling out to non-Pixel devices only recently, many people have been caught unawares. In response to the surge of silent accidental calls received, Google is working with OEMs to develop a fix for the feature. Until then, Android recommends users switch Emergency SOS off for a couple of days or search for the feature in system settings. Some users have suggested turning off Emergency SOS until the issue is resolved. The discussion also touches on topics such as removable phone batteries, Faraday cages, and the reliability of mechanical watches vs smartwatches. Some commenters share their personal experiences with accidentally triggering emergency calls. Others raise concerns about privacy and data collection in the context of emergency services.

### ChatHN: Chat with Hacker News using OpenAI function calling

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/steven-tey/chathn) | 211 points | by [steventey](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=steventey) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36480570)

ChatHN is an open-source AI chatbot that uses OpenAI Functions and the Vercel AI SDK to interact with the Hacker News API using natural language. It allows users to chat with Hacker News and get updates on top stories. The AI can be deployed with just one click and is built on the Next.js framework, OpenAI Functions for AI completions, the Vercel AI SDK for AI streaming, and TailwindCSS for styles. The project is licensed under the MIT license.

Many comments on the post express concerns about potential security risks and implications for potential school controls, among other things. Some have also expressed skepticism about the capabilities of the AI. Others suggest potential uses for NLI in platforms like LinkedIn and Salesforce. One commenter asks for a generic ChatGPT answer to a question about the most popular discussions on AWS, and another discusses his experience with trying to call a function on the ChatHN API.

### Kor: a half-baked prototype that "helps" you extract structured data using LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/eyurtsev/kor) | 116 points | by [BorisWilhelms](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BorisWilhelms) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36484308)

Kor is a prototype AI tool that helps extract structured data from text using LLMs. It allows users to specify the schema of what should be extracted and provides examples, then generates a prompt and sends it to the specified LLMs. The tool then parses the output and provides the results back to the user. While it is integrated with LangChain framework, Kor is still a half-baked prototype with an unstable API.

In the comments, users discussed the flexibility of running models in different languages, and its helpfulness in extracting metadata using LLMs. Some users also shared their thoughts on using LLMs to generate web scrapers efficiently, while others shared alternative models for extracting structured data from text. Furthermore, users discussed their experience using Kor in extracting data, and some suggested using CSS selectors in HTML documents for extracting data.

### Tear Down: Tesla's In-House Radar Design

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ghostautonomy.com/blog/tearing-down-teslas-in-house-radar-design-why-did-they-bother) | 43 points | by [mensetmanusman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mensetmanusman) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36485984)

In a recent analysis, a radar engineer examined Tesla's in-house radar program, which has remained mysterious since the company removed radar from its cars in 2021. The engineer believes that the new HW4 architecture, equipped with Tesla's developed radar, falls short of the specs of rival automotive industry's long-range 4D imagining radars. However, it provides Tesla with increased control, allowing for greater optimization and synchronization of the radar with their overall autonomy system. The analysis also delves into the radar's sensitivity, MIMO topology, and antenna topologies, providing insight into its design approach.

The discussion about the submission revolves around Tesla's decision to develop their own radar program in-house instead of relying on suppliers. One user believes that Tesla does not want to depend on suppliers and is willing to invest in building millions of chips, paying a higher margin, and waiting for supplier time to fall. Another user adds that Tesla's radar program started with a temporal resolution front-facing continental radar, and Tesla Vision, the company's AI-based driving assistant system, has high-resolution phased array radar technology. Another user analyzes the article's technical details, specifically mentioning the radar's geometry.

### Databricks Strikes $1.3B Deal for Generative AI Startup MosaicML

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wsj.com/articles/databricks-strikes-1-3-billion-deal-for-generative-ai-startup-mosaicml-fdcefc06) | 181 points | by [jmsflknr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jmsflknr) | [105 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36478734)

Databricks, a data management and analytics firm, has announced its acquisition of MosaicML, a generative AI startup, in a $1.3 billion deal. The acquisition is aimed at satisfying the increasing demand from businesses to build their own ChatGPT-like language models, according to Databricks' CEO Ali Ghodsi. The deal is expected to provide businesses with the ability to connect their data with services to help create their own cost-effective language models.

Some users on Hacker News were critical of the acquisition, stating that some companies do not have the technical talent to implement LLMs and that this could result in less meaningful value propositions. Others noted that Databricks is a technically-staffed company and that LLM integration would be a perfect fit for its business plan. Additionally, some users discussed the differences between Databricks and Snowflake in terms of data storage and management. Some users were not convinced of the value proposition of LLMs, stating that data warehouses are essentially required for these models. Lastly, some users pointed out that Databricks has replaced its self-managed Spark-on-K8s with third-party recommendations. A few users mentioned AWS SageMaker as a potential competitor to MosaicML.

### Google DeepMind’s CEO Says Its Next Algorithm Will Eclipse ChatGPT

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/google-deepmind-demis-hassabis-chatgpt/) | 17 points | by [neilfrndes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=neilfrndes) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36486343)

Demis Hassabis, the CEO of Google's DeepMind AI lab, has announced that his team is working on an AI system called Gemini, which will combine the language capabilities of large models with techniques used in AlphaGo, the program that defeated a champion player of the board game Go. The system will have capabilities such as planning or the ability to solve problems similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, but with new innovations that will be "pretty interesting", according to Hassabis. The development of Gemini could play a major role in Google's response to the competitive threat posed by ChatGPT and other AI technology.

The discussion is mostly made up of comments that are not directly related to the submission. One user questions whether Google maintains a "shadow brain" internet search, another user writes about having flashbacks to when Google was hyping their search engine, and another user suggests that they should show instead of tell. One user shares an archived link related to the submission. Another user questions the potential for Gemini to compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT and expresses concern about the dangers of AI development. Lastly, a user mentions a headline suggesting that Google's algorithm has surpassed ChatGPT.
