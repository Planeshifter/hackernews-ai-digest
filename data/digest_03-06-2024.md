### Show HN: dockerc – Docker image to static executable "compiler"

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/NilsIrl/dockerc) | 331 points | by [NilsIRL](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=NilsIRL) | [114 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39620540)

Today on Hacker News, a project called dockerc caught the attention of the community. NilsIrl's dockerc allows you to compile Docker images into standalone portable binaries, simplifying the distribution process for your users. Say goodbye to complex setup instructions like "docker run" or package installations – with dockerc, users can just run the executable. The tool supports various features such as specifying arguments, environment variables, volumes, and more. It also offers support for rootless containers, MacOS, Windows (using QEMU), x86_64, and arm64. If you're interested in simplifying Docker image distribution, dockerc may be worth checking out.

- **chxr** found dockerc to be a great project and mentioned that they tried running a sample Python script without needing a Docker container, but instead using QEMU.
- **rnts08** expressed their enthusiasm for the project, highlighting its ability to embed the entire OS within the portable executable binaries.
- **stntn** discussed the rising trend of sending Dockerfiles over simply running commands within Docker containers, while **spckz** pointed out the existence of similar concepts like buildpacks.
- **strngmnd** appreciated the project's concise documentation and suggested following the standard practice of issuing permission requests for any binary downloads.
- **jbvrschr** shared insights on the technical aspects of architecture and container runtimes.
- **Alifatisk** mentioned attempting to create a portable Ruby executable but faced challenges due to the Ruby runtime dependencies.
- **Cu3PO42** raised concerns regarding resource sharing, filesystem mounts, and device access, inquiring about the comparison to AppImage and the handling of capabilities like CAP_SYS_USER_NS.
- **knly** brought up the lack of documentation regarding Docker daemon interactions and networking, with **NilsIRL** clarifying that the project mainly focuses on running applications in containers without Docker daemon interactions.
- **pltlmn** shared an error they encountered while trying to run dockerc on Ubuntu 22.04.

Overall, the discussion covered various aspects of dockerc, from technical considerations to user experiences and comparisons with related technologies like AppImage and buildpacks.

The latest update on Hacker News discusses the significance of the Interaction to Next Paint (INP) becoming a Core Web Vital on March 12. This means that focusing on improving website responsiveness to user input is crucial for web developers. The article emphasizes enhancing compression efficiency with shared dictionaries to optimize page loading times. By utilizing advanced compression algorithms like Brotli and ZStandard along with custom compression dictionaries, websites can achieve significantly higher compression ratios. This approach can lead to faster resource loading and improved performance, making it a valuable technique for web developers to consider.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects related to website performance optimization techniques such as compression algorithms, shared dictionaries, and privacy concerns. There is a debate on the deprecation of Railgun and the advancements made by Cloudflare in improving performance through technologies like Argo Smart Routing. The conversation also delves into topics like cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), fingerprinting for cache defense, and concerns about shared dictionaries potentially enabling tracking attacks. Additionally, there are discussions on the implementation of dictionaries in browsers, the efficiency of different compression approaches like Brotli, and strategies to handle versioning and cache updates efficiently. Furthermore, there is an exploration of methods to enhance loading times by utilizing pre-compressed dictionaries and managing changes in the caching infrastructure effectively.

In an exciting tale of hacking and discovery, a group of skilled researchers successfully uncovered vulnerabilities in Google's systems through the LLM bugSWAT event. This team, consisting of Joseph "rez0" Thacker, Justin "Rhynorater" Gardner, and Roni "Lupin" Carta, embarked on a journey that spanned from Las Vegas to Tokyo and finally to France.
The focus of their investigation was on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), technologies that have been making waves in the tech world. Companies like Google, Meta, and Microsoft are all vying for dominance in this new era of AI. However, in the race to leverage these advanced technologies, some companies neglected basic security principles, leading to the emergence of new security issues.
Google, recognizing the importance of security in AI systems, organized the Bug Bounty event LLM bugSWAT to challenge researchers worldwide to uncover vulnerabilities. Joseph and Justin were initially accepted into the event, and Roni joined them later as their collaboration proved fruitful in brainstorming and testing different ideas.
During the event, the team discovered a critical Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability in Google's Bard platform, specifically within the Vision feature. By exploiting this flaw, they were able to access other users' images without authorization, highlighting a significant security loophole that needed addressing.
Additionally, the team delved into analyzing GraphQL endpoints in the Google Cloud Console, where they uncovered a Denial of Service (DoS) vulnerability, a standout discovery in the competition. Their diligent efforts showcased the importance of security testing in AI systems and the need for continuous vigilance to protect against potential threats.
Through their collaboration and dedication to hacking, this team demonstrated the significance of proactive security measures in the ever-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence. Their story serves as a reminder of the constant battle to stay ahead of cyber threats and safeguard sensitive data in the digital age.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about a team of researchers uncovering vulnerabilities in Google's systems through the LLM bugSWAT event covers a range of topics and viewpoints:
