### AI can catalogue a forest's inhabitants simply by listening

#### [Submission URL](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/10/25/ai-can-catalogue-a-forests-inhabitants-simply-by-listening) | 185 points | by [helsinkiandrew](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=helsinkiandrew) | [103 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38056841)

Researchers at the University of Würzburg have developed an AI system that can identify bird species in the rainforest by listening to their calls. The team collected sound recordings from 43 sites in the Ecuadorean rainforest and manually identified the various bird calls. Then, they trained an AI model to identify 75 bird species from their calls. The AI system was found to be just as accurate as human experts in identifying the bird species. This automated approach could be used to monitor reforestation projects and measure their effectiveness.

The discussion around the submission on Hacker News covers a wide range of topics related to the AI system that can identify bird species by listening to their calls. Some users discuss the potential applications and benefits of this technology, such as monitoring reforestation projects and conservation efforts. Others express skepticism about the effectiveness of AI in detecting maintenance issues in cars or the privacy concerns associated with recording bird sounds. There are also discussions about the market implications and commercial offerings related to the technology, as well as the potential for misuse of such data. Additionally, some users share their experiences with similar projects or express their concerns about the erosion of privacy.

### Genode – Genode on seL4 – IPC and virtual memory

#### [Submission URL](https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sel4_part_2) | 54 points | by [whereistimbo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whereistimbo) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38060698)

The article starts by explaining that in the L4 universe, IPC usually refers to synchronous communication between threads. In the case of seL4, IPC serves two purposes - enabling threads of different protection domains to exchange messages and delegating access rights throughout the system. Genode, a microkernel-based operating system, implements IPC using two thin abstractions: the IPC library for low-level message sending and receiving, and the RPC framework for higher-level message transfers.

To enable Genode's RPC mechanism on seL4, the author provides a seL4-specific IPC library implementation. To familiarize themselves with seL4's IPC mechanism, they modify an existing test program to perform an IPC call between two threads. The author walks through the code modifications needed to create an IPC endpoint, receive an incoming message, and make an IPC call.

However, when executing the code, they encounter an error related to an uninitialized register. The author fixes this error by initializing the GS register properly. Nevertheless, another error occurs due to the lack of a proper IPC buffer for the second thread. To solve this, the author sets up the IPC buffer for the second thread on the same page as the initial thread's IPC buffer.

With the initialization of the IPC buffer in place, the author finally achieves the desired output. The article concludes with the author's plan to address memory management issues in future articles in the series.

Overall, this article provides a detailed and hands-on exploration of IPC and virtual memory in the context of bringing Genode to the seL4 kernel. It offers valuable insights for those interested in kernel development and operating system design.

The discussion around the article "Genode on seL4 - IPC and virtual memory" on Hacker News includes several comments from users. 

User "rdtrmph" expresses their appreciation for sharing fascinating projects related to low-level operating system development in C++. They are interested in such projects and have their own ongoing project.

User "Palomides" comments that while they believe the project is overly hyped and practically unnecessary, it does showcase impressive achievements in software. They find the concept of running a microkernel-based BSD-like operating system on seL4 interesting but not practically valuable.

User "arp242" adds that comparing real-world performance of such systems to Linux and Windows could be an interesting exercise.

User "pjmlp" shares a link to a YouTube video about a C++ operating system utilizing coroutines and standard execution on a Raspberry Pi Pico.
