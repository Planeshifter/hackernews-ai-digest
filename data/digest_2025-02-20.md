#### [Submission URL](https://newslttrs.com/i-put-my-heart-and-soul-into-this-ai-but-nobody-cares/) | 231 points | by [spzb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=spzb) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43120802)

In the ever-evolving landscape of social media, clickbait has taken a new form with the help of generative AI. From fake sculptures to implausible animal antics, AI-generated content is flooding platforms like Facebook with fabricated tales paired with engagement-begging captions. Distinct categories have emerged: "carve the other one, it's got bells on" features ludicrous sculptures, "baking sadcore" highlights forlorn chefs with surreal age claims, and the classic "implausibly cute and/or suffering animals" toys with our emotions through unfeasible scenes.

Despite their obvious absurdity, these posts garner hundreds, sometimes thousands, of genuine reactions. While it seems incredulous that people fall for such artifice, the reality is that these interactions translate into monetary gain. From micro-transactions like "stars" to ad revenue generated by traffic, AI content creators secure an income by exploiting the naive.

This new wave of digital deception functions as fuel for the ceaseless content farms drawing unwitting users to absurd clickbait sites. It's a cycle of fabrication that's surprisingly lucrative, especially in lower-cost regions.

It's a reminder of the skepticism needed in today's digital age. However, real content, crafted by genuine creators, still exists. Support independent voices by engaging mindfully, and if intrigued, dive deeper into authentic discussions—no AI deception required. Sign up for genuine newsletters, and perhaps even let a real dog bake you a real cake. After all, why settle for less when truth is sweeter?

The Hacker News discussion on AI-generated clickbait revolves around several interconnected themes, reflecting skepticism and concern about the erosion of trust in digital spaces:

1. **Gresham’s Law Applied to Information**: Users liken the dominance of AI-generated fake content to "bad currency driving out good," where low-quality, manipulative content displaces truthful information. This undermines societal trust and collective discernment.

2. **Exploitation of Empathy and Trust**: Participants argue that AI-generated scams hijack human empathy, weaponizing it through fabricated stories (e.g., a "105-year-old baker") designed to trigger emotional responses. This manipulation fosters widespread distrust and cynicism, making genuine empathy harder to sustain.

3. **Systemic Failures and Collective Memory**: Many blame broken systems—social media algorithms, profit-driven platforms, and eroded "collective memory"—for enabling misinformation. Public discourse is fractured, with "smart people" retreating into silos, amplifying anxiety and disconnection.

4. **Economic Incentives in Low-Cost Regions**: Facebook’s growth in developing regions (e.g., India, Philippines) is driven by subsidized data and low-cost labor. AI-generated spam, political propaganda, and clickbait thrive here, as small ad revenues hold significant local purchasing power.

5. **Political and Cultural Consequences**: Examples include AI-generated deepfakes in India’s elections and fabricated science content (e.g., fake James Webb Telescope images). Users warn that unchecked disinformation could destabilize democracies and reshape public opinion around crises like Gaza or Trump-era politics.

6. **Pessimism and Calls for Resilience**: While some urge critical thinking, human-authored content, and system redesigns to combat AI spam, there’s overarching pessimism. References to "Moloch" (self-destructive systems) and comparisons to the Middle Ages highlight fears of societal collapse if trust isn’t rebuilt. Others stress that corporate and algorithmic incentives prioritize engagement over truth.

**Key Takeaways**: The discussion underscores a vicious cycle—AI’s低成本 misinformation weakens trust, which in turn makes societies vulnerable to further manipulation. Solutions proposed range from individual skepticism to systemic overhauls, but participants largely agree the problem is entrenched in economic and technological structures.

### Large Language Diffusion Models

#### [Submission URL](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-demo/) | 43 points | by [SerCe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SerCe) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43110317)

In an exciting development for AI enthusiasts and researchers, a new paper details the introduction of Large Language Diffusion with mAsking (LLaDA) – a diffusion model boasting an unprecedented 8 billion parameters, trained entirely from scratch. The research, a collaborative effort by Renmin University of China and Ant Group, pitches LLaDA against LLaMA3 8B, showing that it rivals or even exceeds in performance in certain areas. Drawing inspiration from William Blake's adage, "What is now proved was once only imagined," the work underscores the innovation driven by the core principle of generative modeling: approximating true language distribution through maximum likelihood estimation.

The distinctive approach of LLaDA employs a masked diffusion model that handles pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with an innovative sampling technique. It involves randomly masking all tokens during pretraining and selectively masking response tokens in SFT. This method simulates diffusion from full masking to unmasking, displaying remarkable scalability and competitive performance compared to traditional autoregressive models.

Several case studies showcase LLaDA's impressive capabilities, from solving math problems and recommending popular movies to generating Python code snippets and translating complex phrases into multiple languages. It even exhibits an adeptness at producing coherent multi-turn dialogues, illustrating its comprehensive utility in real-world applications.

The paper highlights LLaDA's potential to redefine the landscape of language modeling by offering a robust alternative to the much-discussed autoregressive models, positing a future where diffusion-based approaches could lead the way.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Benchmark & Training Skepticism:**  
   Commenters express doubts about the benchmarks comparing LLaDA to LLaMA3-8B, questioning potential misrepresentation of performance metrics. Concerns are raised about the training dataset and whether it ensures fair comparisons (e.g., "16th tokens" reference). A call for transparency in research methodology is emphasized.

2. **Factual Accuracy in Examples:**  
   A movie recommendation example citing *The Empire Strikes Back* (attributed to George Lucas) sparks corrections. Users note Irvin Kershner as the actual director and highlight potential errors in the model’s outputs, stressing the need for factual rigor in published examples.

3. **Technical Debates on Masking & Denoising:**  
   The masking strategy is compared to image diffusion (e.g., pixel unmasking vs. token unmasking). One user speculates whether LLaDA’s approach relies on stochastic denoising akin to DDIM (Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models), allowing the model to iteratively refine masked tokens during generation.

4. **Input Length Constraints:**  
   A key critique centers on LLaDA’s lack of variable-length input support, relying on fixed-length sequences with EOS padding. Replies explain its semi-autoregressive generation strategy, where responses are generated in fixed blocks of tokens, leading to questions about practical usability and efficiency.

5. **Generation Strategy & Token Handling:**  
   Uncertainty arises about how LLaDA handles "junk" tokens during masking and whether its block-by-block decoding aligns with traditional autoregressive models. The role of EOS (End-of-Sequence) tokens in marking responses is debated, with clarifications on iterative block refinement.

**Key Themes:**  
- The discussion reflects cautious optimism about LLaDA’s novel diffusion approach but underscores concerns about benchmarks, transparency, and practical limitations (e.g., fixed input lengths).  
- Community scrutiny highlights the importance of accuracy in published examples and technical clarity.  
- Technical insights suggest parallels with diffusion methods in other domains (e.g., images) but stress unresolved challenges in token-level generation strategies.

In a cutting-edge development from the realm of artificial intelligence, the Magma foundation model has emerged, showcasing remarkable capabilities in interpreting and interacting with multimodal inputs. Developed by a team from Microsoft Research, alongside collaborators from several universities, Magma stands out by successfully bridging verbal, spatial, and temporal intelligence to navigate a wide array of complex tasks.

Magma pushes the boundaries of previous vision-language models by not just understanding but actively planning and executing tasks in the visual-spatial environment. It utilizes vast training data, including images, videos, and robotics data, which are uniquely labeled with Set-of-Mark (SoM) for actionable visual elements and Trace-of-Mark (ToM) for dynamic object tracking in videos. This dual-labeling technique enhances its ability to grasp spatial and temporal dynamics efficiently.

The results are impressive: Magma outperforms specialized models in UI navigation and robotic manipulation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results with less data reliance. It also displays formidable spatial reasoning and cross-domain robustness, excelling in zero-shot evaluations where it solves tasks without domain-specific training. Magma’s prowess extends to video understanding; it even trumps some established models like Video-Llama2 in benchmarks despite using less instructional data.

In practical use cases, Magma can seamlessly navigate digital interfaces, manipulate robots in physical environments, and engage in surprisingly insightful video-based conversations—suggesting next moves in strategic games, leisure activities, or summarizing and predicting video content. This demonstration of multimodal understanding poises Magma as a robust model that could significantly influence future multimodal AI applications.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Magma and Robotics:**

1. **Magma and OpenVLA Model Releases**  
   - The Magma model (Microsoft Research) and OpenVLA (released June 2024) garnered attention for their multimodal capabilities.  
   - Magma’s GitHub release ([github.com/microsoft/Magma](https://github.com/microsoft/Magma)) includes code for UI navigation and robotics tasks. Users debated its adaptability via English instructions versus specialized industrial robots optimized for single tasks.  

2. **Dishwashing and Efficiency Debates**  
   - A thread questioned why robots mimic inefficient human actions (e.g., dishwashing taking hours vs. human 15-minute scrubs). Users noted dishwashers prioritize sterilization/steam over speed, highlighting trade-offs between efficiency and functionality.  

3. **General-Purpose vs. Specialized Robots**  
   - Skepticism arose about humanoid robots handling generic human tasks. Comments favored specialized systems (e.g., vacuum bots) over versatile human-like robots, citing inefficiency and complexity.  
   - Industrial robots thrive in repetitive 24/7 tasks (e.g., assembly lines) but struggle with dynamic home environments requiring adaptability.  

4. **AI Training and Data Challenges**  
   - Synthetic training data and motion-capture datasets (e.g., SMPL-X for hand modeling) were discussed. Concerns included the scarcity of real-world “messy” interaction data and the need for robust generalization beyond lab settings.  

5. **Human vs. Robot Design**  
   - Appliances are designed for humans, not robots. General-purpose robots face hurdles in replicating nuanced skills (e.g., plastering walls) without extensive contextual training.  
   - One user quipped, “Airplanes don’t flap wings like birds,” arguing robots shouldn’t mimic humans but prioritize task-specific optimizations.  

6. **Humor and Naming**  
   - Lighthearted remarks about the name “Magma” included “Ms. Magma” and comparisons to other models (GPT, Llama).  

**Key Themes**:  
- **Efficiency > Human-Like Behavior**: Most agree robots should prioritize efficiency over mimicking human actions.  
- **Specialization Wins**: Niche robots (vacuum cleaners, dishwashers) excel, while general-purpose humanoids remain impractical.  
- **Data Quality Over Quantity**: Real-world, diverse training data is critical for robust AI performance in dynamic environments.  
- **Cautious Optimism**: Excitement for AI/robotics progress, tempered by acknowledgment of current technical and practical limits.  

The discussion reflects pragmatism, emphasizing domain-specific solutions and the challenges of bridging AI advances with real-world usability.
