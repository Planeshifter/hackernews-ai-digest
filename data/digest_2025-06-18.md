#### [Submission URL](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/homomorphically-encrypted-crdts/) | 253 points | by [jakelazaroff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jakelazaroff) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44309520)

In an intriguing exploration of local-first software, a challenge arises: how to collaboratively work with a friend on a top-secret document when they're miles away, all without revealing content to even the app developers? The magic word here is encryption—specifically, end-to-end encryption. By agreeing on a secret key, you and your long-distance friend can secure your CRDT-stored document, rendering it unreadable by third parties.

Still, there's a hiccup: asynchronous collaboration becomes problematic. Without a syncing server capable of understanding and merging encrypted changes, updates pile up, leading to potential data overload upon reconnection. This conundrum ushers in the potential savior: homomorphic encryption, a technology that lets you perform computations on encrypted data as if it were decrypted.

Enter an adventure into the marvels of homomorphic encryption, offering a potent solution: a server can merge updates on encrypted data without deciphering its contents, preserving your document's secrecy. For curious minds wanting to explore further, references like an interactive guide on CRDTs and insights into fully homomorphic encryption are recommended reads.

A Rust implementation comes into play, using the TFHE-rs library to demonstrate this in code. It generates a key pair, encrypts data, performs server-side computations, and decrypts results. Ultimately, this story paints a vivid picture of balancing privacy with collaboration, highlighting the cutting-edge possibilities and restrictions of encryption in software development.

The Hacker News discussion explores the feasibility, challenges, and nuances of combining **CRDTs** (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types) with **homomorphic encryption** (FHE) for secure, real-time collaboration. Here's a concise breakdown:

---

### **Key Points**
1. **CRDT Performance Concerns**:
   - Critics argue CRDTs are often **slow** and architecturally complex, with benchmarks showing encrypted merges taking **1.06 seconds** vs. **0.52 nanoseconds** for unencrypted data. Some implementations (e.g., WOOT, RDX) face scalability issues under heavy load.
   - Counterarguments highlight **optimizations** (e.g., merge-sort-like algorithms, state-based vs. operation-based CRDTs) and libraries that handle millions of changes efficiently. Notably, inefficient implementations—not CRDTs themselves—may be the bottleneck.

2. **Homomorphic Encryption Overheads**:
   - FHE slowness is acknowledged—**bootstrapping** historically took hours, now reduced to ~0.1 seconds (as in TFHE-rs). However, FHE introduces **multiplicative overheads**, making merges ~2 billion times slower in one example.
   - Despite this, progress continues: **real-time FHE** for AI inference or AES-128 encryption is deemed plausible with further optimization.

3. **Server Role & Trust**:
   - CRDTs are **serverless by design**, but a relay server can assist with message buffering. Homomorphic encryption ensures the server **never decrypts data** while merging changes.
   - Clarifications: CRDTs differ from Operational Transform (OT), which requires a central server. A relay server here simply forwards encrypted CRDT updates without understanding content.

4. **Practicality & Use Cases**:
   - Projects like **JupyterLite + OtterGrader** demonstrate encrypted code grading on Chromebooks. For small-scale or asynchronous workflows (e.g., collaborative text editing), the setup may suffice.
   - Critics question scalability: combining FHE with CRDTs could exacerbate latency, but proponents argue niche applications (e.g., sensitive military/government use) might justify the trade-offs.

5. **Technical Nuances**:
   - **State-based vs. operation-based CRDTs** have different trade-offs for E2E encryption. Some suggest operation-based CRDTs better suit encrypted workflows.
   - Debates arise around whether clients need to be **online** to decrypt and merge updates. Solutions involve periodic syncs or buffering changes until reconnection.

---

### **Notable Quotes**
- **On FHE Progress**: *“Bootstrapping improved from hours to 0.1 seconds—TFHE-rs shows it’s possible. Real-time FHE-AI is now plausible.”*  
- **On CRDT Scalability**: *“Bad CRDT implementations spam HTTP calls per keystroke. Good ones handle millions of changes smoothly.”*  
- **On Practicality**: *“Imagine merging encrypted docs at 1 Hz. Painful but doable for top-secret use cases where latency isn’t critical.”*

---

### **Conclusion**
While merging CRDTs with FHE presents **significant performance hurdles**, the discussion highlights guardrails for progress: better algorithms, hardware advancements, and optimized libraries. For high-stakes, privacy-first applications, the trade-offs may be worthwhile—but mainstream adoption likely hinges on further breakthroughs.

### Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life) | 235 points | by [EvgeniyZh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EvgeniyZh) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44308711)

Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of AI's problem-solving prowess with a groundbreaking study by Toby Ord and insights from the METR organization. This research takes a fresh look at how AI agents perform over time on complex tasks, uncovering intriguing patterns in their success rates.

The study builds on the empirical work of researchers Kwa et al. (2025) and introduces a pivotal concept: a constant failure rate model. According to this model, AI agents have a fixed probability of failing each minute on tasks, similar to how radioactive substances decay over time. This leads to an "exponential decline" in success rates as task duration increases, allowing AI tasks to be characterized by their "half-life." This simplified model makes it possible to predict how well an AI agent might perform on tasks of varying lengths, sparking curiosity about the underlying reasons for their success or failure on longer assignments.

METR’s study of AI agent capabilities offers eye-opening data. They've discovered an exponential improvement trend in the duration of tasks that AI can handle, noting a remarkable aspect: every seven months, the task length that AI can reliably solve doubles. These benchmarks include tasks from software engineering, cybersecurity, general reasoning, and machine learning, showcasing improvements in AI agents' ability to assist in research.

To measure performance, METR uses a 50% success rate threshold to establish a benchmark for reliability. Though higher success rates like 80% or an almost perfect 99.9999% would be ideal for practical applications, their current focus allows them to track a clear trend in AI improvements. Notably, the doubling of capabilities at the 50% success rate closely mirrors the 80% rate, implying broader implications for AI advancement.

Yet, the study raises important questions about the generalizability of these results beyond the task suite. While AI outshines humans in some lengthy, complex calculations, humans still outpace AI in tasks requiring spatial reasoning or physical intuition. Furthermore, factors such as automated scoring, lack of interaction with other agents, and resource constraints could skew the perceived improvements.

The discussion dives deeper with survival analysis, a field focusing on how failure probabilities evolve over time, offering further insights into AI's growing capabilities. The idea that an AI could tackle an 8-hour task but not a 16-hour one prompts fascinating questions about its functioning and task segmentation.

Ultimately, this research offers a novel lens through which to gauge AI's advancements, though acknowledging its current limits. As future work explores other domains and tasks, understanding AI's development through these multifaceted measures could unlock its full potential in problem-solving.

It invites the tech community to engage with AI on a deeper level, testing the boundaries of machine understanding and cooperation—a truly innovative leap towards more intuitive AI systems.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the **WFGY project**:

- **User Inquiry**: A user (ltmtkng) asked how WFGY improves reasoning stability in advanced LLMs (like GPT-4, Llama-3) and reduces contradictions or ambiguity in outputs. They questioned whether it was just a "prompt hack."

- **WFGY's Response**:  
  - WFGY clarified it is **not a simple prompt hack** but uses a **"semantic kernel"** embedded in the uploaded PDF to inject structured logic checks into the model's reasoning process.  
  - This kernel helps stabilize outputs by detecting contradictions, correcting context drift, and enforcing logical consistency during inference.  
  - Empirical results claim **40% improvements** on multi-step reasoning tasks and reduced instability, even for smaller models.  
  - It’s **model-agnostic** (works across LLMs) and explicitly guides the model’s reasoning path through prompts, bypassing the need for fine-tuning.  

- **Key Takeaway**: The user found the explanation insightful, highlighting WFGY’s focus on **structuring logic** within prompts to combat hallucinations and improve reliability without requiring complex setups.
