### Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life) | 235 points | by [EvgeniyZh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EvgeniyZh) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44308711)

Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of AI's problem-solving prowess with a groundbreaking study by Toby Ord and insights from the METR organization. This research takes a fresh look at how AI agents perform over time on complex tasks, uncovering intriguing patterns in their success rates.

The study builds on the empirical work of researchers Kwa et al. (2025) and introduces a pivotal concept: a constant failure rate model. According to this model, AI agents have a fixed probability of failing each minute on tasks, similar to how radioactive substances decay over time. This leads to an "exponential decline" in success rates as task duration increases, allowing AI tasks to be characterized by their "half-life." This simplified model makes it possible to predict how well an AI agent might perform on tasks of varying lengths, sparking curiosity about the underlying reasons for their success or failure on longer assignments.

METR’s study of AI agent capabilities offers eye-opening data. They've discovered an exponential improvement trend in the duration of tasks that AI can handle, noting a remarkable aspect: every seven months, the task length that AI can reliably solve doubles. These benchmarks include tasks from software engineering, cybersecurity, general reasoning, and machine learning, showcasing improvements in AI agents' ability to assist in research.

To measure performance, METR uses a 50% success rate threshold to establish a benchmark for reliability. Though higher success rates like 80% or an almost perfect 99.9999% would be ideal for practical applications, their current focus allows them to track a clear trend in AI improvements. Notably, the doubling of capabilities at the 50% success rate closely mirrors the 80% rate, implying broader implications for AI advancement.

Yet, the study raises important questions about the generalizability of these results beyond the task suite. While AI outshines humans in some lengthy, complex calculations, humans still outpace AI in tasks requiring spatial reasoning or physical intuition. Furthermore, factors such as automated scoring, lack of interaction with other agents, and resource constraints could skew the perceived improvements.

The discussion dives deeper with survival analysis, a field focusing on how failure probabilities evolve over time, offering further insights into AI's growing capabilities. The idea that an AI could tackle an 8-hour task but not a 16-hour one prompts fascinating questions about its functioning and task segmentation.

Ultimately, this research offers a novel lens through which to gauge AI's advancements, though acknowledging its current limits. As future work explores other domains and tasks, understanding AI's development through these multifaceted measures could unlock its full potential in problem-solving.
