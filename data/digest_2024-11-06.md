### The deep learning boom caught almost everyone by surprise

#### [Submission URL](https://www.understandingai.org/p/why-the-deep-learning-boom-caught) | 289 points | by [slyall](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=slyall) | [174 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42057139)

The surprising resurgence of deep learning can largely be attributed to three key figures who dared to challenge the status quo in AI: Prof. Fei-Fei Li, Geoffrey Hinton, and Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang. In an insightful article, Timothy B. Lee recounts how Li, amidst skepticism, took on the mammoth task of creating ImageNet – a groundbreaking dataset of 14 million images organized into nearly 22,000 categories. This initiative, launched in 2009, provided the essential fuel for the deep learning revolution that would follow.

When ImageNet was initially released, it garnered little attention until 2012, when the University of Toronto's AlexNet utilized it to achieve stunning results in image recognition—a pivotal moment that ignited the deep learning boom. Hinton, often regarded as the father of deep learning, spent years promoting neural networks despite widespread doubt, while Huang recognized the transformative potential of GPUs in AI. The convergence of these innovative ideas transformed deep learning from neglect to a central force in AI, reshaping the technological landscape.

This piece from Understanding AI beautifully encapsulates how vision, persistence, and the willingness to break norms turned a once-derided concept into the cornerstone of contemporary artificial intelligence.

In the discussion on Hacker News regarding the resurgence of deep learning, participants engaged in a complex examination of various aspects of AI, primarily focusing on the implications of the ImageNet dataset and its pivotal role in advancing deep learning technologies.

1. **General Skepticism and Historical Context**: Users expressed skepticism about the portrayal of AI systems as truly intelligent, suggesting that they often misinterpret human cognition and common-sense reasoning. There was a concern that many past paradigms in AI (like expert systems) have failed in achieving real human-like intelligence.

2. **Importance of Training Data**: Multiple commenters highlighted the intricate relationship between organisms and their ability to learn from their environments over billions of years versus AI's reliance on vast quantities of training data, as illustrated by the ImageNet project. The conversation emphasized how living beings evolve and learn with limited data, in contrast to AI systems needing extensive curated datasets for training.

3. **Comparisons with Biological Learning**: Participants compared the learning mechanisms of AI systems, particularly neural networks, to biological processes like evolution and the brain's circuitry. This included discussions about how neural networks learn patterns from data similarly to how animals learn from interactions with their environments.

4. **Complexity of Neural Networks**: The complexity of neural architectures was a recurring theme, with some arguing that advanced networks (like CNNs and LLMs) exhibit capabilities that mimic sophisticated human-like understanding. However, doubts lingered about whether these systems genuinely comprehend or merely pattern-match without true intelligence.

5. **Evolution vs. AI Training**: Comparisons were drawn between the evolutionary processes that shape organisms and the training processes that create AI models. This led to debates about the effectiveness and limits of both organic and artificial learning systems, as well as discussions on how well AI might ever replicate human-like functionalities.

6. **Symbolic vs. Statistical Approaches**: Some commenters pointed to the differences between traditional symbolic AI (like LISP) and contemporary statistical approaches, raising questions about reliability and the potential for achieving general intelligence.

Overall, the discussion illustrated a blend of admiration for the accomplishments within the deep learning field while acknowledging significant reservations about its current capabilities and the philosophical implications of what constitutes true intelligence in both AI and animals.
