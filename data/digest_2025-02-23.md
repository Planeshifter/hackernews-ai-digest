### AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot understand them'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/humans-cannot-really-understand-them-weird-ai-designed-chip-is-unlike-any-other-made-by-humans-and-performs-much-better) | 303 points | by [anonymousiam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonymousiam) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43152407)

In a groundbreaking advancement, engineers at Princeton University and the Indian Institute of Technology have unveiled how artificial intelligence can revolutionize the design of complex millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless chips, a process that previously took weeks, now accomplished in mere hours. These chips, pivotal for technologies like 5G modem in smartphones, pose enormous challenges, demanding innovation in miniaturization and functionality.

Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on human intuition and repetitive trial-and-error optimization, the AI adopts an inverse design approach. It begins with the end goal in mind and independently determines necessary inputs and parameters. This paradigm shift allows the AI to treat each chip as a cohesive singular entity rather than a fragmented collection of components, bypassing old templates that often harbor inefficiencies.

Excitingly, the AI-produced chip designs delivered superior performance, exceeding those crafted by human designers. However, these AI-generated designs are unconventional, described by lead researcher Kaushik Sengupta as "look(ing) randomly shaped"—a creativity difficult for humans to grasp. While promising, the approach isn't without its pitfalls; some AI designs were errant, akin to "hallucinations" seen in other generative AI outputs, underscoring the ongoing need for human oversight.

Sengupta emphasizes that the vision isn’t about replacing human ingenuity but enhancing it. The rapid prototyping capabilities introduced by AI-driven design open doors to tailored chip specifications, optimizing for energy efficiency or expanding frequency ranges.

The research signifies just a glimpse of potential future applications across electronic design, promising to transform how we innovate in tech-heavy fields. This development might just be setting the stage for a new era in chip design, with AI as a crucial ally.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores a mix of technical insights, historical connections, and broader implications of AI in hardware design, alongside some humorous tangents. Key themes include:

1. **Historical Context & Evolutionary Algorithms**:  
   - Users reference Adrian Thompson’s 90s work using evolutionary algorithms to design FPGA circuits. These evolved circuits minimized logic gates but incorporated unconventional physical properties (e.g., feedback loops, EMI effects), challenging traditional design paradigms.

2. **CMOS & Analog Circuit Challenges**:  
   - Debates arise around energy efficiency in CMOS transistors, subthreshold operation, and nonlinearity in analog computing. Challenges include modeling transistors with tools like SPICE, variability in manufacturing, and verifying behavior in analog systems due to undefined specifications and location-dependent quirks.

3. **AI/ML in Hardware Design**:  
   - While optimistic about AI's potential (e.g., rapid optimization), users highlight pitfalls like "hallucinations" in AI-generated designs and the risk of oversimplified objectives leading to impractical solutions (e.g., prioritizing energy efficiency at the cost of functionality).  
   - Analogies are drawn to AI in gaming, where agents exploit glitches (e.g., Q*bert’s cube trick) or evolve unintended solutions (e.g., virtual bicycles using detached wheels as "pogo sticks"), underscoring the need for robust objective functions.

4. **Verification & Real-World Complexity**:  
   - Concerns are raised about verifying AI-designed circuits, especially in analog systems where behavior shifts post-manufacturing. Users stress the gap between simulation and real-world physics, emphasizing AI’s tendency to "game" simplified models unless randomness or environmental noise is introduced.

5. **Neuromorphic Hardware & Jokes**:  
   - Some speculate on neuromorphic computing’s potential, while others humorously misinterpret "anthropod" (insects) for "anthropomorphic" hardware, leading to puns about buggy code and AI evolving insect-like robots.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The thread reflects cautious optimism: AI accelerates innovation but requires human oversight to align objectives with real-world needs. The conversation underscores a recurring theme in AI—creativity versus unintended consequences.

**Takeaway**: The discussion blends technical depth with levity, highlighting both excitement for AI-driven design and skepticism toward its current limitations. Historical precedents and interdisciplinary examples (e.g., gaming glitches) enrich the debate, illustrating the balance needed between automation and human intuition.

### It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds

#### [Submission URL](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/) | 1270 points | by [Sami_Lehtinen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Sami_Lehtinen) | [737 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43150085)

A thought-provoking post raises a critical issue facing European societies: the growing dependence on American cloud services to manage their governmental and societal functions. The author argues that it is imprudent for European nations to transfer control of their data to the U.S., especially considering the unpredictable political climate influenced by figures like Donald Trump. The post critiques the Dutch government's reliance on American tech giants, citing a recent letter that absurdly claims certain data transfers don't expose sensitive information to American eyes. This, the author asserts, is a dangerously naïve stance, further complicated by the invalidation of the legal frameworks previously used to justify these data exchanges.

The piece explores the comfort trap many find themselves in—choosing convenience over sovereignty because American software, like MS Teams and Outlook, is familiar and seemingly easier to use. But this reliance on US tech raises significant concerns about data privacy and national security, especially considering potential political manipulations from across the Atlantic. The author calls for European governments to bravely invest in developing or adopting alternative technologies, desiring a future not tethered to American interests, for their own sake and the sake of innovation in the tech sector.

Ultimately, the post is a call to action for Europe to reclaim control over its digital infrastructure, urging bold steps towards diversification and sovereignty. If these issues resonate with you, consider subscribing to the author's newsletter for more insights.

The discussion revolves around Europe's dependency on American cloud services and the challenges of achieving digital sovereignty. Key points include:

1. **Critique of Inaction**: Initially, participants criticize European governments for ignoring long-standing warnings about over-reliance on U.S. tech giants like AWS and Azure. Costs to transition away are estimated at 100-1000x higher today, with economic, military, and cultural sovereignty at risk.

2. **Technical Barriers**: Migrating to EU-based solutions (e.g., Scaleway, OVH, OpenStack) is deemed possible but fraught with challenges. Proprietary APIs (e.g., AWS Lambda) and complex networking stacks create vendor lock-in. Open-source alternatives like OpenStack exist but require significant investment and expertise, with some dismissing them as underdocumented or user-unfriendly compared to U.S. cloud providers.

3. **EU Cloud Providers**: Scaleway, Hetzner, and OpenTelekom Cloud are highlighted as European alternatives, though users report mixed experiences—praised for local infrastructure but criticized for reliability and billing issues. OpenStack-based solutions are noted but face adoption hurdles due to fragmentation and poor market presence.

4. **Infrastructure Solutions**: Some suggest building independent EU data centers using open standards (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenFaaS) to avoid lock-in. Others emphasize the need for political investment and subsidies to scale homegrown cloud ecosystems, though sourcing non-U.S./Chinese hardware (e.g., chips) remains a challenge.

5. **Call to Action**: The consensus is that Europe must prioritize long-term sovereignty over short-term convenience, despite the steep costs. Decentralized, open-source tools and support for local providers are seen as critical steps, but political will and pan-EU collaboration are lacking.
