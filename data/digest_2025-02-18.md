#### [Submission URL](https://humane.com/media/humane-hp) | 193 points | by [colesantiago](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=colesantiago) | [215 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43095811)

In a strategic leap toward shaping the future of work, HP Inc. has announced its acquisition of key AI capabilities from Humane, including the AI-driven platform Cosmos, along with an impressive portfolio of over 300 patents. This $116 million transaction is set to conclude by the month's end and marks a definitive moment in HP's transformation into an experience-led tech giant.

With Cosmos and Humane's talented team of engineers, HP plans to develop an intelligent ecosystem that spans its diverse product line, from AI-enhanced PCs to smart printers. This acquisition will not only infuse new technological prowess into HP's offerings but will also create HP IQ, a dedicated AI innovation lab pushing the boundaries of workforce productivity. The Humane co-founders see this collaboration with HP as an opportunity to redefine intelligent experiences, leveraging HP's global presence and operational expertise.

Ultimately, HP aims to harness this synergy to deliver next-generation, AI-enabled devices that empower organizations and their employees to excel in the ever-evolving landscape of modern work. This bold move underscores HP’s commitment to innovation and reinforces its position as a leader in the global technology arena.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on HP's Acquisition of Humane's AI Tech and AI Pin Shutdown:**

1. **AI Pin Functionality Loss:**  
   Users criticize Humane’s AI Pin, a $700 wearable device, which will lose core features (calls, messaging, AI responses) after Humane’s servers shut down on February 28, 2025. The device’s reliance on cloud connectivity renders it nearly useless post-shutdown, sparking frustration over its short lifespan and lack of offline functionality.

2. **Refund Demands and Consumer Rights:**  
   Many argue customers deserve full refunds, as the device’s value depends on now-defunct services. Some propose regulations requiring companies to open-source software or provide refunds if hardware becomes obsolete due to discontinued services. Skepticism arises about enforcement, especially if companies go bankrupt.

3. **HP’s Acquisition Strategy Scrutinized:**  
   HP’s $116M purchase of Humane’s patents and talent is compared to past failures (e.g., Palm, Autonomy), with users doubting HP’s ability to innovate. Critics label the move as “buying junk” to stockpile patents rather than fostering meaningful AI advancements.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns:**  
   Debates emerge about the FTC/CFPB’s role in protecting consumers from “vendor-locked” hardware. Suggestions include mandating open-source software for abandoned products or enforcing refunds. Others counter that regulations are ineffective, placing responsibility on consumers to research products.

5. **Technical Workarounds and Community Efforts:**  
   A few users propose hacking the AI Pin to redirect queries to alternative services (e.g., ChatGPT) or self-hosted servers. However, most view the device as a lost cause, with one user sharing a story of it “bricking within days.”

6. **Broader Tech Industry Critiques:**  
   Comparisons to LG’s abandoned WebOS and HP’s history of half-hearted product attempts (e.g., 3Com Audrey) highlight skepticism toward corporate commitments to long-term support. The discussion reflects broader disillusionment with tech companies prioritizing hype over sustainability.

**Key Sentiment:**  
The community expresses frustration over disposable tech, distrust in HP’s acquisition strategy, and calls for stronger consumer protections. The AI Pin’s demise is seen as a cautionary tale of overhyped, cloud-dependent gadgets failing to deliver lasting value.

### Tensor evolution: A framework for fast tensor computations using recurrences

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03402) | 49 points | by [matt_d](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=matt_d) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43093610)

In a groundbreaking paper, researchers Javed Absar, Samarth Narang, and Muthu Baskaran have introduced "Tensor Evolution" (TeV), a framework designed to speed up the evaluation of tensor computations. Tensors, essentially multi-dimensional arrays, are pivotal in high-performance computing and machine learning, but their optimization presents unique challenges. TeV extends the widely-used Scalar Evolution (SCEV) technique from the LLVM and GCC compilers, leveraging the theory of "Chain of Recurrences" to better handle tensors' complex operations, such as slicing and broadcasting, which don't have scalar equivalents.

This innovative approach not only seeks to enhance compiler optimizations within machine learning and HPC domains but also invites further exploration and potential applications beyond its initial scope. The paper suggests that while not every computation fits perfectly into TeV's capabilities, its integration could lead to significant advancements. The authors express hope that the tensor-evolution concept will inspire continued research and development in this exciting area.

### AMD's game-changing Strix Halo, formerly Ryzen AI Max, poses for new die shots

AMD fans, rejoice! The curtain has been lifted on the Strix Halo, also known as Ryzen AI Max, and the reviews are flooding in. Showcasing an impressive engineering feat, the Strix Halo is no ordinary APU. It packs a punch with 16 cores, 32 threads rooted in the advanced Zen 5 architecture, and a formidable 40 CU iGPU, all while offering support for a whopping 128GB of unified memory.

Thanks to high-resolution die shots, we've gotten a closer look at the meticulous design tweaks by AMD. The Die to Die interfaces have been shaved down, which compliments the use of 3D V-Cache—an efficiency boost we see in AMD's desktop processors. But the spotlight remains on the integrated GPU powered by RDNA 3.5 and its adept handling of memory demands through the swift LPDDR5X memory with a 256-bit interface.

The inclusion of a potent XDNA 2 NPU promises a notable leap in AI performance, potentially surpassing even Nvidia’s RTX 4090. Add to that a robust I/O setup with PCIe 4.0, USB 4, and a suite of media codec supports, and the Strix Halo stands as a powerhouse set to redefine mobile computing.

With laptops like the Asus ROG Flow Z13 primed for market entry, the Strix Halo’s potential is vast. However, initial adoption seems tepid—owing perhaps to pricing concerns and limited configurations hovering around the $2500 mark for the 32GB variant. Yet, anticipation remains high for configurations offering full TDP utilization in compact mini-PCs.

AMD's latest offering underscores a shift towards integrated graphics in laptops, a trend indicating that the future could see many ditching dedicated graphics altogether. While some argue AMD is playing catch-up to Apple’s M-series chips, the Strix Halo undeniably sets a new benchmark for x86 mobile processors, hinting at sleek, power-efficient designs in this new era of computing. Keep your eyes peeled as this technology hits the shelves!
