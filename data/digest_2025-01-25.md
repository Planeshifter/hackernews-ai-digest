While the product is in its early stages, the team has a roadmap filled with promising features set to enhance your experience. Currently, CopyCat supports only Apple Silicon Macs, as efforts to make it compatible with Intel Macs didn’t succeed.

If you encounter any issues or have questions, the CopyCat team encourages you to reach out via email at [hello@runcopycat.com](mailto:hello@runcopycat.com) or join their active Discord community for support and to share your feedback. Your input is invaluable as they continue to develop and refine the app.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

**User Feedback & Critiques:**  
- Users noted a lack of screenshots or clear demonstration of CopyCat’s features. Some confusion arose over navigating to the download page, prompting others to share a direct link to the homepage ([https://www.runcopycat.com](https://www.runcopycat.com)).  
- Criticisms included frustration over requiring an account sign-up for free software, with one user calling out “corporate worthlessness” for such gatekeeping.  

**Comparisons & Alternatives:**  
- A user highlighted **Meha** ([https://meha](https://meha)), a similar tool they’re building, which operates by controlling Chrome locally for tasks like batch URL generation. Meha’s approach avoids cloud dependency, contrasting with CopyCat’s strategy.  
- Some praised CopyCat’s potential to differentiate itself from generic “all-purpose browser agents.”  

**Technical & Development Discussions:**  
- Debate arose over developing AI tools for Macs. A user speculated that Macs’ cost-effective GPU memory (vs. expensive Nvidia setups) and developer demographics (many Mac users in AI/tech) may explain CopyCat’s focus.  
- Comments explored whether local compute (vs. cloud/VMs) could reduce costs, with one suggesting CopyCat’s approach might simplify scalable infrastructure.  

**Usability & Design Suggestions:**  
- Users urged CopyCat to improve its landing page clarity and reduce friction (e.g., removing mandatory sign-ups).  

**Overall Sentiment:**  
While interest exists in CopyCat’s vision, the discussion emphasized unmet expectations for transparency (e.g., screenshots/model details) and smoother onboarding. Comparisons to alternatives like Meha and debates about Mac-first AI tooling underscored broader community trends.
