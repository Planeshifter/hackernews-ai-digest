### The best way to use text embeddings portably is with Parquet and Polars

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/02/embeddings-parquet/) | 215 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43162995)

In today's headlines from Hacker News, we explore the fascinating application of text embeddings, a powerful outcome of the generative AI boom. A tech enthusiast has used embeddings to catalog every Magic: The Gathering card released as of the 2025 Aetherdrift expansion—a total of 32,254 cards. These embeddings, which transform text into numerical vectors, remarkably encapsulate the design and attributes of Magic cards, such as card names, texts, costs, and rarities, allowing for intriguing analyses and visualizations.

The project utilized the gte-modernbert-base embedding model to generate these vectors, creating a rich dataset that discovers similarities among the cards. For example, by applying a simple 2D UMAP projection, the cards naturally cluster by logical categories like color and type.

An interesting challenge this work highlights is how to effectively use and store embeddings. Many opt for vector databases, like faiss or Pinecone, though these can be cumbersome or costly. Instead, this project demonstrates the ability to perform similarity calculations without such databases, showcasing a fast and efficient method using NumPy, which requires minimal system memory and offers quick cosine similarity computations.

Storage efficiency emerges as another critical challenge. Traditional CSV files are bulky and inefficient for embedding storage, being significantly larger than necessary and adding serialization overhead. Instead, the article advocates using Parquet files, which offer a more elegant and portable solution, preserving data in a non-proprietary format that facilitates easier sharing and manipulation.

This innovative use of embeddings not only provides exciting insights into card designs but also sparks broader discussions on efficient data handling—crucial for advancing AI applications.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News thread explores technical strategies for managing vector embeddings, sparked by the Magic: The Gathering card catalog project. Key debates and insights include:  

1. **Storage Formats:**  
   - **Parquet** is praised for its columnar efficiency, compression, and query speed in OLAP contexts (analytics), but critiqued for static data and transactional (OLTP) workloads. Users contrast it with **SQLite**, which offers portability and lightweight operations for smaller datasets.  
   - **LanceDB** and **DuckDB** are highlighted for bridging gaps: LanceDB supports dynamic updates/querying, while DuckDB integrates natively with Parquet and enables fast vector similarity searches (via new `vector` type extensions).  

2. **Performance & Tools:**  
   - **Polars** (Rust-based) is favored over Pandas for speed and lazy execution, especially with Parquet. Users note its ability to filter data efficiently (e.g., `pl.scan_parquet()`).  
   - **Vector Indexing**: Proposals like HNSW (hierarchical navigable small world) serialization in Parquet or standalone libraries (e.g., **USearch**, **FAISS**) are discussed for scalable vector search.  

3. **Challenges & Alternatives:**  
   - Columnar storage limitations: Parquet struggles with frequent updates, leading to workarounds like partition schemes or delta layers.  
   - Compact vector representations (e.g., **Vespa**’s binary encoding, **SimSIMD** kernels for optimized CPU/GPU operations) address payload size and speed.  
   - Structured vs. unstructured data: Debate persists on embedding JSON/text fields directly vs. restructuring inputs for semantic relevance (e.g., using **ModernBERT** to capture implicit structure).  

4. **Emerging Solutions:**  
   - Tools like **Unum’s Cloud** and **USearch** offer alternatives to FAISS, prioritizing SIMD optimizations and cross-language support.  
   - Hybrid approaches (e.g., Polars + Parquet + Ray for distributed workflows) balance portability and performance.  

**Takeaway**: The community leans toward *portable, open formats* (Parquet/SQLite) paired with optimized query engines (DuckDB, Polars) and lightweight indexing, avoiding vendor lock-in. Scalability concerns push interest in GPU acceleration and metadata-aware embeddings.

2. **Memory Management Innovations**:  
   - Neut’s **"allocation canceling"** feature intrigued users, as it aims to reuse or optimize memory allocations during compilation. Questions arose about its algorithmic feasibility and practicality compared to manual management or runtime garbage collection.  
   - The **"necessity"** concept in Neut’s type system, tied to static memory management without garbage collection, was explained in the docs as a way to handle references and pointers safely. This drew parallels to linear types (à la Rust) and resource-tracking systems.

3. **Performance Benchmarks**:  
   - Benchmarks suggested Neut is **1–4x faster than Haskell** in specific cases, though users emphasized that algorithm choices and implementation details heavily influence real-world performance.

4. **Syntax and Tooling Preferences**:  
   - A sub-debate emerged about **syntax formatting**, particularly curly brace placement (e.g., Allman vs. K&R style). Some advocated for configurable formatters to accommodate personal or project-specific preferences.  
   - The built-in **LSP server** and formatter were praised for streamlining development, though opinions varied on syntax design choices like "hugging" parentheses for linearity annotations.

5. **Technical Curiosity**:  
   - Users explored how Neut’s compile-time memory strategies (e.g., ensuring single-use variables) could influence broader PL design, with interest in cross-pollinating ideas between functional and systems languages.  
   - The module system’s checksum-based tarball approach for dependencies sparked curiosity about versioning and reproducibility.

**Key Takeaways**:

     - Proponents of **FlashMLA** argue it shifts decoding to compute-bound regimes via optimizations like efficient KV cache management and parallelization.
     - Critics counter that decoding is inherently memory-bound, especially at smaller batch sizes, and question the math behind claims (e.g., Llama3-8B’s theoretical GFLOPS vs. H100’s memory bandwidth).

3. **Technical Optimizations**:
   - **FlashAttention** is highlighted for reducing memory overhead in attention layers by avoiding intermediate tensor writes, improving both training and inference. **Flash-Decoding** extends this by parallelizing across sequence lengths.
   - **KV Cache Overhead**: Discussions emphasize the trade-offs between recomputing attention scores (compute-heavy) vs. loading cached KV tensors (memory-heavy), with MLA aiming to balance this.

4. **Hardware and Workloads**:
   - **Prefill vs. Decode**: Prefill (context processing) is compute-intensive (dominated by matrix multiplications), while decode (token generation) is typically memory-bound due to sequential GEMV operations and KV cache access.
   - **Batch Sizes**: Larger batches push workloads toward compute-bound regimes, but real-world serving often uses smaller batches, exacerbating memory bottlenecks.

5. **Community Engagement**:

### Conclusion:
The thread underscores the rapid evolution of LLM inference optimizations (FlashMLA, FlashAttention) and the challenges in balancing compute/memory bottlenecks. While FlashMLA shows promise, real-world performance depends on model architecture, hardware, and workload specifics. The debate reflects broader tensions in the ML engineering community between theoretical claims and practical implementation constraints.

### Google Co-Scientist AI fed previous paper with the answer in it

#### [Submission URL](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/02/22/google-co-scientist-ai-cracks-superbug-problem-in-two-days-because-it-had-been-fed-the-teams-previous-paper-with-the-answer-in-it/) | 196 points | by [pcfwik](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pcfwik) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43162582)

Google's new AI tool, Co-Scientist, is under the microscope as the initial buzz turns reflective. This tool, based on Google's Gemini LLM, was acclaimed after supposedly solving a long-standing scientific conundrum just days after being introduced to it. The AI suggested a hypothesis about drug-resistant bacteria, sparking excitement at Imperial College. However, the story's glow dimmed when it was revealed that Co-Scientist had a little head start — it had already "read" a 2023 paper by the same researchers which fleshed out the solution it put forth.

This isn't the first time Google's AI-powered marvels have been critiqued for overstated achievements. For example, Co-Scientist’s proposed drugs for liver fibrosis were already established candidates for that purpose. Similarly, DeepMind's claim of synthesizing new materials lost steam after later findings proved these materials weren't new.

José Penadés, involved in the bacterial project, acknowledged the AI's utility in collating disparate bits of information, but the notion of it being a pioneering scientific mind is perhaps, more dream than reality. The AI isn't conjuring new ideas out of thin air; it's piecing together existing knowledge—a great tool, but one that requires a pinch of scholarly restraint in its promoted capabilities.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion on Google's Co-Scientist AI:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward Google’s Co-Scientist AI, which was initially celebrated for solving a scientific problem but later criticized for relying on pre-existing research it had been trained on. Key themes include:

1. **Overhyped Claims**:  
   Users highlight a pattern of inflated AI achievements, citing Co-Scientist’s "breakthrough" (based on a 2023 paper by the same researchers) and prior examples like DeepMind’s overstated material synthesis. Critics argue such tools merely remix existing knowledge rather than generating novel insights, though some acknowledge their utility in synthesizing information.

2. **Token Predictors vs. Intelligence**:  
   A central debate questions whether large language models (LLMs) like Co-Scientist are merely sophisticated "token predictors" or capable of genuine reasoning. Technical explanations note that models like GPT optimize for next-token prediction, lacking true understanding or world interaction. Critics liken this to statistical pattern-matching, while defenders argue coherent outputs can still mimic reasoning.

3. **Human vs. AI Innovation**:  
   Comparisons to human cognition emerge: humans also build on prior knowledge but can generate novel ideas through real-world interaction and experimentation. LLMs, however, are confined to their training data, unable to form new hypotheses without external input. Some users suggest AI could evolve with reinforcement learning or sensory integration, but current systems fall short.

4. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**:  
   Discussions touch on the "deepity" of interpreting AI outputs as intelligent versus statistically plausible text. Skeptics warn against conflating fluency with insight, while others note that even human discoveries often arise from serendipity or incremental steps. The conversation underscores the need for tempered expectations, framing AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement in scientific research.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus leans toward cautious pragmatism—Co-Scientist and similar tools are valuable for accelerating research but require transparency about their limitations. The hype around AI’s "revolutionary" potential risks overshadowing its role as an advanced assistant, not an autonomous innovator.

### OpenAI Researchers Find That AI Is Unable to Solve Most Coding Problems

#### [Submission URL](https://futurism.com/openai-researchers-coding-fail) | 144 points | by [colinprince](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=colinprince) | [165 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43155825)

OpenAI researchers have unveiled new insights into the world of AI coding capabilities, revealing that even the most advanced models are still no match for human software engineers. Despite CEO Sam Altman's confidence that AI will surpass "low-level" engineers by year-end, a recent study showcases these models' limitations. The developers utilized a benchmark called SWE-Lancer, which tested AI on over 1,400 tasks from Upwork, to evaluate the problem-solving capabilities of OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models, alongside Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

These AI tools were measured on their ability to tackle individual bug-fixing tasks and larger management tasks without internet assistance. Unfortunately, while the AI could handle surface-level issues swiftly, they struggled with identifying bugs in complex code or offering comprehensive solutions, and their superficial confidence often masked underlying inaccuracies.

Interestingly, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed OpenAI's models financially, although it, too, frequently fell short. Researchers highlighted that for AI to reliably undertake real-life coding, models need significantly higher reliability.

As AI continues its rapid evolution, it still trails significantly behind the adept problem-solving skills of human engineers. Yet, there's a growing trend of companies betting on AI at the expense of human jobs, a notion underscored by recent discussions of automating Facebook coding jobs with AI.

   - Financial implications were noted, with references to the $100B+ investments in AI and skepticism about whether scaling LLMs alone achieves "true" AGI.

4. **Impact on Developers:**
   - **Efficiency vs. Skill Erosion:** While LLMs speed up mundane tasks (e.g., searching APIs, drafting scripts), some worry they might hinder deep problem-solving skills. Users emphasized the enduring need for human judgment, especially in debugging and system design.
   - **Tooling Integration:** Suggestions included hybrid workflows combining LLMs with traditional research (e.g., RTFM) and dynamic systems that pull real-time context from documentation or tests.

5. **Frustrations and Workarounds:**
   - Users lamented **declining quality of traditional resources** (e.g., Google Search, Stack Overflow) and the need to "prompt engineer" LLMs heavily for useful outputs.
   - Mixed results were reported in edge cases, such as compiling niche systems (e.g., DeaDBeeF plugins), where LLMs occasionally offered surprising fixes but often fell short without precise context.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs are valued for accelerating certain coding tasks, the consensus is they remain unreliable for complex engineering challenges. Human expertise, critical thinking, and adaptability are still irreplaceable, particularly in nuanced or poorly documented scenarios. The discussion underscores a cautious optimism tempered by practical limitations.
