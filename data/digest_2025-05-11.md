#### [Submission URL](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/title-work-deciphered-sealed-herculaneum-scroll-digital-unwrapping) | 231 points | by [namanyayg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=namanyayg) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43953883)

In an extraordinary revelation, researchers have harnessed the power of digital unwrapping to finally uncover the title and author of a scroll that had been sealed since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The scroll, known as PHerc. 172 from Herculaneum, was identified using advanced imaging techniques as "On Vices" by the Greek philosopher Philodemus. This significant discovery, part of the ongoing Vesuvius Challenge, not only brings new insight into ancient philosophical teachings but also earned the researchers a much-coveted prize of $60,000.

The scroll was painstakingly scanned in July 2024 and the data subsequently released for public analysis, inviting global participation. The title was independently deciphered by Sean Johnson from the Vesuvius Challenge and a research duo from the University of Würzburg, marking a significant milestone in the study of ancient texts. Philodemus, an Epicurean philosopher known for advocating the pursuit of pleasure as a path to a virtuous life, has been a central figure in the vast collection of works found at the Villa of Papyri at Herculaneum.

While the revelation of the work's title is a triumph, questions remain about its exact placement within Philodemus’ larger "On Vices" series, speculated to be at least 10 books long. These achievements highlight the transformative potential of integrating artificial intelligence into humanities research, breathing new life into ancient artifacts and offering fresh perspectives on historical scholarship.

The Vesuvius Challenge, initiated in 2023, continues to push the boundaries of knowledge by encouraging researchers worldwide to delve into the secrets of these ancient scrolls without causing physical harm, embodying a remarkable confluence of technology and history.

The discussion revolves around the appropriateness of labeling the ancient Herculaneum library as "pagan," given its Greco-Roman philosophical texts. Key points of debate include:  

1. **Terminology Concerns**: Critics argue "pagan" is an anachronistic Christian-centric term that imposes later religious frameworks onto a pre-Christian context. Supporters counter that it’s a widely accepted descriptor for Rome’s polytheistic traditions, distinguishing it from Abrahamic faiths.  

2. **Historical Context**: Some emphasize that the library, containing Epicurean works like Philodemus’, reflects a pre-Christian Roman intellectual tradition. Opponents stress that "pagan" risks distorting the era’s worldview, as Christianity hadn’t yet dominated Roman society (in 79 AD).  

3. **Modern Bias**: Users debate whether labeling it "pagan" inadvertently centers a Christian perspective, akin to calling non-Jewish texts "Goy." Comparisons are drawn to modern terminology, like avoiding "pagan" for Indian or Greek studies, to prevent cultural misrepresentation.  

4. **Scholarly Nuance**: Participants note that while "pagan" simplifies categorization, it may strip historical specificity. Alternatives like "non-Christian" or referencing specific philosophies (e.g., Epicurean) are suggested for accuracy.  

The discussion concludes with no resolution but highlights tensions between linguistic convenience and historical fidelity, underscoring the challenge of describing ancient contexts through modern lenses.

### LSP client in Clojure in 200 lines of code

#### [Submission URL](https://vlaaad.github.io/lsp-client-in-200-lines-of-code) | 157 points | by [vlaaad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vlaaad) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43955397)

In a fascinating exploration of coding efficiency, a Clojure enthusiast has created a minimal Language Server Protocol (LSP) client in just 200 lines of code. While initially attempting to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with LSP for smarter code navigation and inquiries, the coder unexpectedly pivoted towards crafting this lean client. This project underscores the power of LSP, which simplifies the integration process between code editors and language-specific tools by leveraging a standardized communication protocol, much like HTTP but for programming languages.

The focus of the project is not broad appeal—indeed, it's humorously noted that the audience might just be the three Clojure developers who write code editors—but rather educational. The challenge taken up was to develop a command-line linter using an LSP server without getting bogged down by the complexity of a full-fledged text editor.

The prototype excludes components like a JSON parser and document syncing, keeping things streamlined. Instead, it establishes a foundational communication layer between client and server using Java 24 with virtual threads, optimizing performance. The setup employs JSON-RPC, a protocol for remote procedure calls, layered over the base communication, to handle requests and responses efficiently.

By translating the client and server communication from byte streams into manageable JSON blobs, the project illustrates a clever application of programming concepts—demonstrating not just technical prowess, but the joy of solving 'MxN problems' with an 'M+N' approach. This clever synthesis from the Clojure community offers both a learning opportunity for developers and a testament to the art of coding small yet effective solutions.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the minimal Clojure LSP client highlights several key themes and debates:

1. **Clojure’s Strengths and Criticisms**:  
   - Supporters praise Clojure’s conciseness, expressiveness, and Java interop, arguing that its syntax allows for elegant solutions (e.g., the 200-line LSP client). Critics counter that Clojure’s reliance on Java and perceived complexity (e.g., `core.async`) can deter newcomers.  
   - Some users note that Clojure’s functional style and immutable data structures make code readable and maintainable, while others find its abstraction level challenging.  

2. **Java Boilerplate and Dependencies**:  
   - Comparisons to Java emphasize Clojure’s brevity—200 lines in Clojure vs. verbose Java boilerplate. However, subthreads acknowledge hidden complexities, such as dependency management (e.g., JSON libraries) and startup times for LSP servers.  
   - Technical debates arise over Clojure’s use of JAR files, native executables, and trade-offs in performance vs. simplicity.

3. **Clojure’s Niche and Community**:  
   - The post humorously targets "three Clojure devs," sparking discussions about the language’s niche appeal. Some argue Clojure’s learning curve limits adoption, while others highlight its passionate community and use in production systems.  
   - Mentions of **Jank** (a Clojure dialect targeting C++) reflect interest in expanding Clojure’s reach beyond the JVM, though skepticism remains about its mainstream potential.

4. **Is Clojure "Dying"?**:  
   - Mixed opinions emerge: Some users joke about Clojure’s "dying" status, while others point to active podcasts, new projects (e.g., Jank), and steady corporate adoption. Concerns about job market viability are countered by anecdotes of long-term professional use.  

5. **Tooling and Language Design**:  
   - The LSP client project sparks praise for Clojure’s composability and REPL-driven development. Discussions also touch on broader language design philosophies, with comparisons to Python, Rust, and JavaScript.  
   - A recurring theme is the importance of tooling (e.g., LSP) in enhancing developer experience, regardless of language popularity.

**Key Takeaway**: The thread reflects a blend of admiration for Clojure’s elegance and pragmatism, tempered by debates over its ecosystem challenges and niche appeal. While enthusiasts champion its expressiveness, the broader programming community remains divided on its accessibility and future trajectory.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.customerexperiencedive.com/news/klarna-reinvests-human-talent-customer-service-AI-chatbot/747586/) | 243 points | by [elsewhen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=elsewhen) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43955374)

t solely about speed or efficiency, but about the quality of interactions that come from understanding, empathy, and human connection,” Geller noted.

In a surprising shift, Klarna, the buy now, pay later giant, is reintroducing human elements into its customer service strategy, just a year after its bold assertion that AI could replace the roles of 700 human representatives. At the time, Klarna had leaned heavily into automation, cutting costs and boasting impressive AI stats, such as reducing average resolution times to under two minutes. However, growing customer frustrations and a desire for more empathetic interactions have now prompted a rethink.

Klarna's spokesperson, Clare Nordstrom, emphasizes how AI will continue to provide speed and efficiency but highlights the irreplaceable value of human empathy and expertise. "AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy," she states, underscoring a balanced approach to customer service that clearly integrates both human and machine efforts.

CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledges past missteps, recognizing that prioritizing cost savings inadvertently compromised service quality. The new strategy will feature a flexible "Uber-type setup" for customer support, focusing on attracting talented professionals who can deliver exceptional service experiences.

This pivot comes amid industry-wide realizations that customer satisfaction is deeply rooted in human connection. Studies reinforce this, with a significant portion of customers expressing frustrations over impersonal chatbot interactions and a clear need for access to human support for more complex or sensitive issues. Klarna's revised approach suggests that a hybrid model, leveraging both human and AI strengths, could be the key to future-proofing customer service.

The Hacker News discussion on Klarna's reversal to incorporating human customer service, despite earlier AI-driven cuts, highlights several critical themes:

1. **Skepticism About Motives**: Users speculate that Klarna’s pivot is a strategic move to polish its image ahead of a potential IPO, framing itself as an “AI company” to attract higher valuations, rather than a genuine prioritization of customer experience.

2. **Critique of BNPL Model**: Commentators compare Klarna’s business to “loan sharking,” criticizing its high-interest rates and exploitative practices. Critics argue BNPL services target vulnerable demographics, enabling debt accumulation for non-essential purchases, despite Klarna’s claims of affordability.

3. **AI’s Role vs. Human Empathy**: While AI efficiently handles routine tasks (e.g., resolving missing food orders), users acknowledge its limitations in complex or sensitive scenarios. Many support a hybrid model but caution that human agents risk becoming a cost-cutting “Uber-style gig workforce” rather than a meaningful improvement.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**: In markets like the Netherlands, regulators are scrutinizing BNPL providers for predatory practices. Critics highlight Klarna’s fees (e.g., 4% per transaction vs. traditional methods) and the social impact of normalizing debt, especially among younger users.

5. **Technical Execution Challenges**: Klarna’s AI tools are criticized for clunky workflows and poor integration, suggesting the hybrid shift stems from technical shortcomings, not just empathy-driven strategy.

6. **BNPL’s Impact on Consumer Behavior**: Proponents argue BNPL boosts sales by making purchases psychologically affordable (e.g., splitting payments), while detractors warn it reduces long-term customer spending and perpetuates debt cycles, akin to credit cards but with less transparency.

7. **Industry Comparisons**: Users contrast Klarna with platforms like Uber and DoorDash, noting differences in core models (consumer finance vs. service logistics) but parallels in gig-economy labor structures.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects broad skepticism about Klarna’s intentions and the BNPL sector’s ethics, with cautious optimism for hybrid customer service models. However, concerns persist about regulatory risks, debt exploitation, and whether human integration addresses systemic issues or merely serves as PR.

### Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning with Zero Data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) | 82 points | by [leodriesch](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leodriesch) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43951985)

In a fascinating leap forward for AI, researchers have introduced "Absolute Zero," a revolutionary approach that pushes the boundaries of machine learning by omitting external training data entirely. This innovative paradigm, proposed by Andrew Zhao and team, spotlights the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system designed to independently generate and solve its own tasks to enhance reasoning—without relying on pre-existing datasets.

The novelty here is its reliance on reinforced self-play with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a mechanism that traditionally benefits from human-supplied question-and-answer sets to train models. Absolute Zero, however, sidesteps this requirement, creating a model that evolves by crafting challenges suited to its learning goals, embracing a future where AI may need to autonomously learn beyond human-provided data.

Notably, AZR not only stands out by thriving on zero external data but also delivers state-of-the-art results in complex coding and math tasks, surpassing those models trained on vast human-curated collections. This breakthrough showcases potential scalability and adaptability across different model scales and architectures, forging a path towards more independent and open-ended AI learning systems. This development invites speculation on the implications of autonomous AI learning as systems grow beyond human-level intelligence.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Absolute Zero" AI research highlights a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism, with several recurring themes:

1. **Breakthrough Potential**: Users acknowledge the novelty of eliminating human-labeled data for reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in coding and math benchmarks. Some highlight this as a step toward overcoming a major bottleneck in developing AI reasoning capabilities without reliance on external datasets.

2. **Skepticism About Novelty**: Critics question how "revolutionary" the approach truly is. One user points out that *self-play* (a cornerstone of the method) feels obvious in hindsight, comparing it to techniques like AlphaZero. Others note that the paper underemphasizes practical implementation challenges, such as scaling or refining self-generated tasks beyond simple domains.

3. **Comparison to Big Labs**: Commenters liken the work to research from OpenAI or DeepMind, with debates about whether such labs would have published similar findings. Some argue that while the concept might seem basic, perfecting the training pipeline (e.g., reward mechanisms, efficient verification) is where true innovation lies.

4. **Model Reliability Concerns**: Skeptics warn that self-generated tasks could lead to "blind" models prone to reinforcing errors or unstable reasoning chains. One user cites GPT’s occasional struggles with nonsensical self-corrections, speculating that human oversight or structured checkpoints might still be necessary to ensure reliability.

5. **Debating "True Reasoning"**: A central thread questions whether AZR demonstrates genuine reasoning or clever pattern mimicry. Critics argue that true reasoning requires grounding in real-world knowledge, while supporters counter that self-play with domain-specific verification (e.g., Python interpreters validating code) might suffice for limited tasks.

6. **Publishing Practices**: A meta-debate arises about incentives in AI research, with one user criticizing the tendency to prioritize positive results over negative ones. Others note that the paper itself includes strong positive benchmarks, though technical details (e.g., dataset scaling, computational costs) are underexplored.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about the paradigm’s potential but emphasizes unresolved challenges—scalability, generalization beyond narrow domains, and the murky line between learned heuristics and "true" reasoning.
