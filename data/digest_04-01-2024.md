### Discord starts down the dangerous road of ads this week

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/) | 33 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39899765)

Discord, the popular communication platform for gamers, is breaking its tradition of being ad-free and is now allowing video game makers to advertise to its users through Sponsored Quests. These ads offer in-game rewards to PC gamers for getting their friends to watch them play via Discord. While this marks a shift in Discord's business model, the ads are designed to be less intrusive compared to traditional social media ads, as users can opt out of personalized promotions. The company aims to help game developers reach more gamers through this form of marketing. 

The decision to implement ads is a departure from Discord's previous stance against advertising, which was seen as a key feature setting it apart from other social media platforms. Despite the introduction of ads, Discord assures users that they have the option to control the ads they see and that their data privacy is respected. However, the long-term implications of this move remain uncertain. 

Apart from Sponsored Quests, Discord is also exploring other revenue streams like selling sponsored profile effects and avatar decorations. The platform's growing revenue, user base exceeding 200 million monthly active users, and potential plans to go public indicate its significant market presence. While the introduction of ads may not significantly disrupt users who are uninterested, Discord must carefully balance its monetization efforts to ensure they do not detract from the core user experience that has made it popular among gamers.

- **lzypngn**: They mentioned having issues with Discord crashing whenever they played YouTube videos. Another user suggested that it might be an April Fools' temporary thing.
- **jboogie77**: Complains about Discord being the worst piece of software they have used.
