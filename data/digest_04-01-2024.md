With modern languages becoming increasingly versatile and incorporating features from various paradigms, the term "multi-paradigm" has become commonplace. Languages like Python, JavaScript, Java, C++, and more now offer a mix of imperative, object-oriented, and functional programming features.

Looking ahead, the author predicts a shift towards post-paradigm languages like Rust, Nim, and Gleam. These languages are designed to empower programmers by embracing a mix-and-match approach to programming styles, rather than confining them to one specific paradigm. By drawing on the strengths of past paradigms without being shackled by them, these languages offer greater flexibility and creativity to developers.

In this evolving landscape, the focus is on incorporating the best features from different paradigms into languages and tooling, irrespective of traditional categorizations. The future of programming promises a vibrant diversity of languages, each picking the best aspects of various paradigms to create a more dynamic and inclusive programming environment.

The discussion about the submission revolves around the concept of transcending programming paradigms. One user points out that languages like Rust, Nim, and Gleam are designed to move beyond paradigms, incorporating features from various paradigms like imperative and functional programming. However, there is some disagreement about whether multi-paradigm languages truly support paradigms equally, with examples cited from languages like Python and Ruby.

Another user argues that the notion of moving past paradigms can be contradictory, as programming fundamentally involves solving problems in different ways, aligning with various paradigms based on the nature of the problem. They emphasize the importance of understanding different programming paradigms and using a multi-paradigm approach to tackle a wide range of problems effectively.

Further discussion delves into specific aspects of languages like Gleam, highlighting its functional programming capabilities and comparisons to languages like Python and Haskell. There is also a debate about the definitions and practical implications of functional programming, with differing opinions on its significance and the role of specific languages in exemplifying functional programming principles. Overall, the conversation underscores the evolving nature of programming paradigms and the diverse approaches programmers take to address challenges.

The paper titled "Jamba: A Hybrid Transformer-Mamba Language Model" introduces a new base large language model called Jamba, which combines Transformer and Mamba layers in a novel mixture-of-experts architecture. This hybrid model provides high performance while fitting on a single 80GB GPU, offering high throughput and a small memory footprint compared to traditional Transformers. Jamba demonstrates state-of-the-art results on language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations, showing strong performance for up to 256K tokens context length. The authors explore various architectural decisions and plan to release checkpoints for further exploration.

### Discord starts down the dangerous road of ads this week

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/) | 33 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39899765)

Discord, the popular communication platform for gamers, is breaking its tradition of being ad-free and is now allowing video game makers to advertise to its users through Sponsored Quests. These ads offer in-game rewards to PC gamers for getting their friends to watch them play via Discord. While this marks a shift in Discord's business model, the ads are designed to be less intrusive compared to traditional social media ads, as users can opt out of personalized promotions. The company aims to help game developers reach more gamers through this form of marketing. 

The decision to implement ads is a departure from Discord's previous stance against advertising, which was seen as a key feature setting it apart from other social media platforms. Despite the introduction of ads, Discord assures users that they have the option to control the ads they see and that their data privacy is respected. However, the long-term implications of this move remain uncertain. 

Apart from Sponsored Quests, Discord is also exploring other revenue streams like selling sponsored profile effects and avatar decorations. The platform's growing revenue, user base exceeding 200 million monthly active users, and potential plans to go public indicate its significant market presence. While the introduction of ads may not significantly disrupt users who are uninterested, Discord must carefully balance its monetization efforts to ensure they do not detract from the core user experience that has made it popular among gamers.
