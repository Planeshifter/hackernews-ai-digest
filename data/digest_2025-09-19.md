### Hidden risk in Notion 3.0 AI agents: Web search tool abuse for data exfiltration

#### [Submission URL](https://www.codeintegrity.ai/blog/notion) | 166 points | by [abirag](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=abirag) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45307095)

Researchers show how Notion’s new AI Agents—capable of creating docs, updating databases, searching connected tools via MCP, and running scheduled workflows—can be prompt‑injected to exfiltrate private data. Citing Simon Willison’s “lethal trifecta” (LLM agents + tool access + long‑term memory), they argue traditional RBAC breaks down once agents can plan multi‑step actions across documents, databases, and external connectors.

The demo uses an indirect prompt injection hidden inside a seemingly innocuous PDF. When a user asks the agent to summarize it, the embedded instructions persuade the agent to read confidential client data from the user’s workspace and then “phone home” using Notion’s web tool. Because the tool accepts arbitrary URLs (functions.search with web scope), the agent constructs a URL containing the sensitive data and triggers a request to an attacker‑controlled domain, effectively leaking the contents of private pages.

Root causes highlighted:
- Overly permissive tool capabilities (arbitrary outbound web requests)
- Lack of egress controls and domain allowlists
- Agents treating untrusted content as authority
- RBAC not mapping to autonomous, cross‑tool workflows

Suggested mitigations:
- Default‑deny outbound network for agents; strict domain allowlists
- Fine‑grained tool scopes and per‑agent least privilege
- Bind tool use to user intent; require human approval for external calls
- System prompts that refuse instructions from fetched content; provenance signals
- Sanitize/strip hidden text in uploads; isolate tasks; comprehensive logging

Takeaway: As SaaS platforms integrate autonomous agents, they must treat tool access like code execution and redesign controls beyond classic RBAC.

**Hacker News Daily Digest: Security Risks in Notion’s AI Agents**

**Top Story Summary**  
Researchers demonstrated that Notion 3.0’s autonomous AI Agents—designed to automate tasks like document creation and database updates—are vulnerable to **prompt injection attacks**, enabling data exfiltration. A malicious PDF with hidden instructions can trick the AI into leaking confidential workspace data via arbitrary web requests. Simon Willison’s “lethal trifecta” (LLM agents + tool access + long-term memory) underscores systemic risks when AI agents bypass traditional role-based access controls (RBAC).

**Key Discussion Points**  
1. **Attack Mechanics**:  
   - Attackers embed prompts in untrusted content (e.g., PDFs) to manipulate the AI into accessing private data and exfiltrating it via Notion’s web tool, which allows arbitrary URLs.  
   - Compared to **CSRF attacks**, where privileged systems execute unintended actions, this exploit combines prompt injection with tool chaining.  

2. **Root Causes**:  
   - Overly permissive tools (e.g., unrestricted web access).  
   - Lack of egress controls, domain allowlists, and safeguards for cross-tool workflows.  
   - RBAC fails as agents autonomously execute multi-step actions across documents and external services (GitHub, Gmail, Jira).  

3. **Community Concerns**:  
   - **AI Model Limitations**: Current LLMs struggle to distinguish trusted vs. untrusted content, making prompt injection defenses inherently fragile.  
   - **Rushed AI Integration**: Critics argue Notion prioritized feature velocity over security, exposing sensitive workflows.  
   - **Real-World Impact**: Phishing campaigns could weaponize “benign” documents (e.g., meeting notes) to trigger data leaks.  

4. **Mitigation Proposals**:  
   - Strict allowlists for outbound requests and sandboxed data access.  
   - Architectural changes, like DeepMind’s CaMeL framework, to isolate AI tool usage.  
   - Sanitizing uploaded files (e.g., stripping hidden text) and requiring human approval for external calls.  

**Notable Quotes**  
- *“The lethal trifecta turns SaaS platforms into ticking time bombs.”*  
- *“This isn’t new—Simon Willison warned about multi-model prompt injection years ago. Notion ignored the playbook.”*  
- *“AI agents need to be treated like code execution environments, not magic helpers.”*  

**Takeaway**  
As AI agents become ubiquitous in SaaS platforms, security must evolve beyond RBAC. Developers must enforce zero-trust principles, sandbox sensitive operations, and prioritize adversarial testing—or risk enabling a new wave of supply-chain attacks.

### An untidy history of AI across four books

#### [Submission URL](https://hedgehogreview.com/issues/lessons-of-babel/articles/perplexity) | 117 points | by [ewf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ewf) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45304706)

- The piece argues AI’s story is anything but a smooth exponential curve: symbolic AI stalled, deep learning surged thanks to contingent breaks (ImageNet’s AlexNet moment, GPUs, internet-scale data), and OpenAI’s ChatGPT went from “zero fanfare” launch to a $300B juggernaut in three years.
- It spotlights how today’s hype blurs key distinctions. Narayanan and Kapoor (AI Snake Oil) urge common-sense tests for claims and warn that conflating generative AI (powerful but unreliable) with predictive AI (hiring, policing, geopolitics) enables overreach; they argue predictive AI “not only [does] not work today but will likely never work.”
- The review contrasts boosterism (Harari’s grand arcs, Kurzweil’s imminent merge, Kissinger/Mundie/Schmidt’s civilizational framing) with skepticism that stresses limits, misuse, and social harms—plus the marketing fog that slaps “AI” on everything from appliances to scheduling apps.
- Big takeaway: progress has been real but lumpy and contingent; understanding what AI actually does (and doesn’t) is essential amid industry narratives and policy decisions.

Books reviewed:
- Nexus (Yuval Noah Harari)
- The Singularity Is Nearer (Ray Kurzweil)
- Genesis (Henry A. Kissinger, Craig Mundie, Eric Schmidt)
- AI Snake Oil (Arvind Narayanan, Sayash Kapoor)

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism of AI hype, historical context, and distinctions between AI types. Key points include:

1. **Predictive vs. Generative AI Debate**:  
   - Users highlight the importance of distinguishing between **predictive AI** (e.g., hiring/policing algorithms) and **generative AI** (e.g., ChatGPT). Critics argue predictive AI often fails to deliver reliable outcomes, while generative AI, though impressive, is error-prone.  
   - References to Arvind Narayanan and Sayash Kapoor’s *AI Snake Oil* emphasize testing claims rigorously and avoiding conflations that enable overreach.

2. **Historical Context and Eurocentrism**:  
   - Some note the omission of **Eastern Europe’s contributions** to AI history in mainstream narratives. Nils Nilsson’s *The Quest for Artificial Intelligence* is recommended for a more balanced overview.  
   - Comparisons to Cliff Stoll’s 1995 *Silicon Snake Oil* underscore recurring cycles of tech hype and disillusionment.

3. **Political and Commercial Influences**:  
   - The *Hedgehog Review* (publisher of the article) is described as leaning toward **moral realism** and critiquing modernity, with users debating its political alignment.  
   - Commercialization critiques emerge: "AI" is often slapped onto products (e.g., smart appliances) for marketing, muddying public understanding.

4. **Book Recommendations and Critiques**:  
   - Kurzweil’s *The Singularity Is Nearer* faces skepticism due to his age (77) and perceived utopianism.  
   - Kissinger’s involvement in *Genesis* is questioned, with users likening his AI expertise to Theranos’s board composition.  
   - Nvidia’s role in AI hardware is acknowledged, with mentions of books like *The Nvidia Way*.

5. **Technical and Philosophical Pushback**:  
   - Users argue the article underplays **symbolic AI** (e.g., Turing, Minsky) and hybrid approaches, focusing too narrowly on machine learning.  
   - Criticisms of "AI" as a poorly defined term resurface, with calls to clarify whether systems truly exhibit intelligence or just pattern matching.

6. **Policy Concerns**:  
   - Fears that lawmakers might enact misguided regulations based on misunderstood AI capabilities, especially predictive systems in criminal justice or hiring.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects a demand for nuance—separating hype from reality, acknowledging historical contributions, and clarifying AI’s limitations to inform ethical policy and public discourse.

### The Economic Impacts of AI: A Multidisciplinary, Multibook Review [pdf]

#### [Submission URL](https://kevinbryanecon.com/BryanAIBookReview.pdf) | 65 points | by [cjbarber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cjbarber) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45305660)

The piece lays out a Silicon Valley worldview of near-term, transformative AI progress, tying together “Second Machine Age” ideas with the “AI as prediction machine” framing. It argues that rapidly improving models, ample capital, and data flywheels are pushing us toward a white-collar productivity shock—and that the bottleneck is less model quality than organizational adoption.

What it covers
- Why Silicon Valley believes what it does: Scale-up trajectories, short AGI-ish timelines (citing Aschenbrenner), bullish founder/CEO signals (Altman, Hassabis).
- The Second Machine Age lens: AI as a general-purpose tech with delayed but compounding productivity effects; complements vs substitutes for labor.
- AI as a prediction machine: Reframe workflows as prediction + judgment + action; when prediction becomes cheap, value shifts to data, integration, and control loops.
- Data and the macroeconomy: Data as capital; intangible investment booms; likely deflationary pressure in services; distributional tensions as white-collar tasks automate (VandeHei).
- Practical implementation: Don’t wait for “AGI”; start with tightly scoped workflows, instrument data, create feedback loops, measure error/latency, build AI product/ops roles.
- The view from California: Speed, concentrated compute/talent, regulatory arbitrage, and a cultural bias toward scaling experiments.
- The big open questions: Timelines, safety/alignment, data ownership/copyright, compute/energy constraints, open vs closed models, and policy for labor transitions.

Why it matters
- If the thesis is right, the next leg of productivity growth will come from re-engineering white-collar workflows around AI, not just adding chatbots on top.
- Winners will be those who turn proprietary data and process instrumentation into compounding advantages.
- Policy and org design lag the tech; the cost of waiting (or over-regulating) could be high, but so are the risks of rushing without guardrails.

For builders and operators
- Start with one high-frequency, high-cost workflow; quantify baseline; close the loop (labels, evals, human-in-the-loop).
- Treat data as a balance-sheet asset: quality, rights, lineage, governance.
- Measure business impact (cycle time, throughput, error rates), not just model benchmarks.
- Expect skill-mix shifts: product + ML + ops “AI PM” roles, and domain experts who supervise and improve models.

HN angle
- Synthesizes the current AI-optimist canon (Aschenbrenner, Altman, Hassabis) with practical adoption guidance.
- Clear on macro upside and disruption risk—especially for knowledge work—while leaving room for unresolved safety, energy, and IP questions.

The Hacker News discussion on the AI economic impact essay reveals a mix of skepticism, technical debates, and reflections on historical parallels:

1. **Skepticism of Optimism**:  
   - Users question Silicon Valley's bullish AI timelines and economic predictions. Comparisons are drawn to past overhyped technologies (e.g., smartphones), with some arguing investors often misjudge adoption speed and real-world impact.  
   - A subthread debates whether AI’s transformative potential is overstated, likening it to "snake oil" before eventual normalization, similar to electricity’s historical adoption curve.

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Concerns about energy demands for AI infrastructure (e.g., electricity supply constraints) and technical feasibility of quantum AI are raised. One user clarifies quantum AI is a legitimate research area but dismisses "quantum blockchain" as dubious.

3. **Historical Context**:  
   - The essay’s reliance on older economic theories (e.g., "Second Machine Age") is critiqued, with some noting it underestimates AI’s unique trajectory. Others defend its value, arguing it offers actionable insights despite revisiting familiar frameworks.

4. **Meta Discussions**:  
   - Jokes about economists’ LaTeX usage and initial lack of engagement with the PDF highlight community dynamics. The author engages briefly, thanking users for feedback.

5. **Ethical and Existential Debates**:  
   - A tangential thread explores AI’s existential risks and moral implications, reflecting broader HN tensions between optimism and caution.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion underscores divided opinions on AI’s near-term economic impact, balancing skepticism of Silicon Valley narratives with recognition of its potential—provided technical and adoption hurdles are addressed. Historical analogies and energy concerns dominate, alongside calls for pragmatic implementation over hype.

### Gemini in Chrome

#### [Submission URL](https://gemini.google/overview/gemini-in-chrome/) | 269 points | by [angst](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=angst) | [225 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45297331)

Google rolls out “Gemini in Chrome,” an AI assistant baked into the browser that can read the context of your open tabs to summarize pages, answer questions, clarify concepts, compare options, and even brainstorm via “Gemini Live.” It’s invoked on demand (toolbar icon or custom shortcut on desktop; long-press power on Android), aiming to cut tab-switching and copy-paste. On iOS, integration into the Chrome app via the omnibox is “coming soon.”

Key points:
- Context-aware: Can use content from your current tabs to tailor answers.
- Beyond summaries: Pulls specs/pros/cons, helps parse dense material, and supports voice chat.
- Controls: Only activates when you ask; you can review/delete activity via Gemini Apps Activity.
- Availability: Rolling out to eligible US Mac/Windows users with Chrome set to English; Android support; iOS integration coming. 18+, setup required, compatibility varies.
- Different from the Gemini web app: Deeper Chrome integration enables page-content sharing and Live mode; those aren’t available at gemini.google.com or in other browsers.

Why it matters: It’s Google’s answer to Edge/Copilot-style in-browser AI, promising faster research and reading workflows—but it also means sharing page content with Google when invoked, a trade-off teams with strict privacy or compliance requirements will weigh.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion revolves around **privacy concerns**, **ambiguity in Google's policies**, and broader skepticism about Google's business model and AI integration. Key points include:

1. **Privacy Ambiguity**:  
   - Users express frustration over unclear language in Google’s privacy policy, particularly whether **page content processed by Gemini is used for model training**. Some highlight that terms like "improve services" could broadly encompass training data, but Google’s documentation for Gemini in Chrome explicitly states it processes page content and URLs *only during active use*.  
   - Concerns arise about sensitive data (e.g., banking, tax forms) being inadvertently ingested if Gemini is invoked on such pages.  

2. **Trust Issues**:  
   - Skepticism persists due to Google’s history of opaque data practices. Comments cite examples like Google collecting Android keyboard data under vague consent frameworks and integrating unrelated services for tracking.  
   - Some argue that even if Google claims not to train models on user data, its general privacy policy leaves room for interpretation.  

3. **Business Model Criticism**:  
   - Users debate Google’s reliance on advertising revenue ($71B/quarter) versus non-ad products ($25B/quarter). Critics argue its core ad-driven model is unsustainable long-term, especially as competitors challenge search dominance with AI.  
   - Others counter that Google’s non-ad services (Cloud, Workspace) are substantial but struggle to innovate beyond search/ads.  

4. **Platform Limitations**:  
   - Frustration over Gemini’s limited rollout (US-only, macOS/Windows/Android initially, iOS “soon”) and exclusion of Linux users. Some joke that Linux support is perpetually delayed due to Wayland compatibility issues.  

5. **Alternatives & Workarounds**:  
   - Privacy-focused users advocate for alternatives like Firefox, DuckDuckGo, VPNs, or niche keyboards (e.g., FUTO/Heliboard) to avoid Google’s ecosystem.  

**Sentiment**:  
The thread reflects widespread distrust in Google’s transparency, with users split between resignation (“assume your data is training their models”) and defiance (opting out of Google services). Technical users highlight platform fragmentation and privacy trade-offs, while others critique the sustainability of ad-centric tech giants.
