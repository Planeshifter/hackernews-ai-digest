### LIMO: Less Is More for Reasoning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) | 353 points | by [trott](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trott) | [124 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991676)

In a groundbreaking study from the world of computational linguistics, researchers have introduced LIMO—an innovative approach to reasoning with large language models that defies conventional thinking about the need for extensive training data. Traditionally, it’s believed that complex tasks demand vast amounts of training data to ensure accuracy. Yet, the team behind LIMO achieved impressive results in mathematical reasoning with a remarkably small dataset, using just 817 training examples. This is a minuscule fraction compared to past methods.

LIMO’s performance is nothing short of revolutionary: the model scored 57.1% on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) and an astounding 94.8% on the MATH dataset. These results outstrip previous models that required 100 times more training data, underscoring LIMO's significant efficiency and effectiveness.

The researchers propose the "Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis," which suggests that well-developed language models can unlock sophisticated reasoning with minimal, strategically designed teaching examples. This hypothesis reshapes our understanding of how insights are embedded and extracted from pre-trained models, particularly emphasizing that concise demonstrations can serve as powerful cognitive guides.

To foster ongoing advancements, the researchers have made LIMO accessible as an open-source suite, aiming to spur further exploration into data-efficient reasoning. This study not only presents a leap in artificial intelligence capabilities but also opens new pathways for sustainable data usage in future technology developments.

The Hacker News discussion about the LIMO research paper raises several critical insights and debates:

1. **Role of Pre-Trained Models & Data Filtering**:  
   Commenters highlight that the "small" training dataset (817 examples) relied heavily on **pre-existing knowledge** from the underlying model (Qwen-25B). The R1 filtering process distilled 10 million problems into high-quality examples, suggesting the efficiency gains stem from leveraging prior training rather than novel reasoning capabilities. Some compare this to textbooks distilling foundational knowledge for students.

2. **Skepticism About Novelty**:  
   Critics argue the results may overstate innovation, as the approach essentially **distills existing capabilities** of advanced base models. A recurring analogy: using a small, curated dataset is akin to an expert studying a concise textbook—effective but not revolutionary. One user likens it to "climbing Everest with better gear," where progress stems from improved tools (filtered data) rather than fundamentally new methods.

3. **Debates on Efficiency vs. Overfitting**:  
   Concerns arise about whether the small dataset introduces **heavy regularization**, limiting generalizability. Users reference projects like TinyZero and "simple test-time scaling" to highlight alternative data-efficient methods. Others counter that the results validate strategic fine-tuning, emphasizing quality over quantity in training data.

4. **Comparisons to Traditional Methods**:  
   The discussion draws parallels to **compiler design** and educational practices, where progress builds incrementally on prior work (e.g., high-level languages built atop assembly). Similarly, LIMO’s success is framed as optimizing existing model capabilities rather than inventing new reasoning frameworks.

5. **Open Questions and Pragmatic Takeaways**:  
   While some question the paper’s framing (e.g., "Less-Is-More Hypothesis"), others praise its **practical value** for industry applications, where distilling large models into efficient versions is critical. The release of LIMO as open-source is noted as a positive step for further research.

**Key Tension**: The debate centers on whether LIMO represents a breakthrough in reasoning or merely a clever application of data curation on top of powerful base models. While results are impressive, many emphasize that the true innovation lies in data filtering and knowledge distillation, not in "teaching" models to reason from scratch.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01584) | 151 points | by [enum](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=enum) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992336)

In a refreshing twist on traditional AI benchmarks, a new paper, "PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models," proposes a unique test that's designed to assess general reasoning abilities rather than niche, expert-level knowledge. Crafted by Carolyn Jane Anderson and her team, this benchmark draws inspiration from the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge, offering tasks that are challenging yet accessible to the general public.

The study highlights significant capability gaps in current AI models that standard benchmarks fail to capture. Notably, even cutting-edge models like OpenAI's outperform established competitors when challenged with these new reasoning tasks. The findings are intriguing: models that excel in specialized knowledge tests encounter unexpected difficulties in more general, logic-oriented challenges.

One standout from the study is DeepSeek R1, a model prone to admitting defeat or offering uncertain responses rather than risking incorrect answers. This behavior underscores a need for improved inference-time techniques that guide models to wrap up reasoning before their capacity is maxed out.

This research also examines how extending reasoning time impacts accuracy, shedding light on the point of diminishing returns. As AI continues to evolve, this paper sets the stage for developing more robust, adaptable models that reflect human-like reasoning across a broader spectrum of tasks. For anyone interested in AI's next frontier, this paper is a compelling read.

   - Critics argue some puzzles (e.g., identifying brands or cities) rely on **memory/recall** rather than pure reasoning.  
   - Supporters counter that even "trivial" tasks require **non-trivial mental search** (e.g., filtering plausible candidates under constraints), which models struggle with.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to **ARC-AGI puzzles**, which blend perception and logic, and **Project Euler problems**, where brute-force computation often overshadows reasoning.

2. **Model Weaknesses Exposed**  
   - Examples highlight models failing basic logic, like comparing decimals (e.g., "Is 99 > 911?") due to **arithmetic confusion** or misidentifying digit places.  
   - DeepSeek R1’s tendency to **give up prematurely** or produce nonsensical answers (e.g., "Dry Eye" puzzle) underscores gaps in structured reasoning.  
   - Users note models often **overcomplicate steps** or get trapped in loops, even with chain-of-thought prompting.

3. **Training and Benchmark Critiques**  
   - Some suggest **improved prompting strategies** (e.g., step-by-step breakdowns) or **reward functions** that encourage diverse reasoning paths over brute-force token generation.  
   - Criticisms of the benchmark’s **US-centric examples** and unclear distinction between "PhD-level" vs. general knowledge (e.g., the term "PhD Knowledge" is dismissed as rebranded IQ testing).  
   - Comparisons to **GPQA** and **Humanity's Exam** highlight existing benchmarks requiring niche expertise, which this paper avoids.

4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Users question whether **RLHF** (human feedback) stifles models’ natural reasoning by prioritizing "safe" answers.  
   - The discussion underscores the need for benchmarks that **isolate reasoning** from memorization and cultural biases, while improving models’ ability to **self-correct** mid-process.

**Takeaway**: The paper sparks important conversations about defining and testing reasoning in AI, but challenges remain in designing tasks that truly separate logic from recall and cultural knowledge.

### Intel ruined an Israeli startup it bought for $2B–and lost the AI race

#### [Submission URL](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1tra0sfye) | 96 points | by [danielklnstn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielklnstn) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992783)

In a fascinating deep dive, we explore the rise and fall of Habana Labs, an Israeli semiconductor startup that Intel acquired with high hopes back in 2019. This startup was poised to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space with its promising Gaudi chips, which even caught Amazon’s attention for powering their large language models in the cloud.

Fast forward a few years, and the tale has flipped: Nvidia is now valued at a staggering $3.5 trillion, while Intel’s valuation has plummeted to $80 billion. Intel recently reported disappointing financial results and ultimately decided not to further develop Gaudi processors beyond their third iteration. This effectively sealed the fate of Habana Labs as yet another unsuccessful acquisition in Intel’s history.

This is particularly surprising given the track record of Avigdor Willenz, the Israeli entrepreneur behind Habana Labs. Known for successful ventures like Galileo and Annapurna Labs, both of which were acquired by major tech players for billions, Willenz’s string of wins had seemed almost untouchable.

What went wrong? The answers point back to Intel's own challenges. Even as Intel tried to break into the AI space—correctly identifying its significance—it struggled with acquisitions. It attempted to integrate Habana as a separate entity before ultimately dismantling it last year. Much of Habana’s original talent left soon after their retention period, taking with them the innovative spark that first attracted industry giants.

Intel’s decision not to acquire Mellanox for a strategic position in AI, an opportunity Nvidia snatched up eagerly for $7 billion, only adds salt to the wound. It’s a classic story of missteps and missed opportunities in the fast-paced tech world, highlighting the unpredictable nature of competition and the precarious journey from innovation to market dominance.

The Hacker News discussion about Intel's acquisition of Habana Labs and its broader struggles in the AI chip market highlights several key themes:

### 1. **Intel’s Management and Acquisition Missteps**
   - Commenters criticize Intel’s history of mishandling acquisitions, arguing that Habana Labs’ failure reflects systemic issues like poor integration, lack of strategic focus, and internal culture clashes.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to other Intel acquisitions (e.g., Nervana, Altera) that failed to deliver, suggesting a pattern of buying innovative startups only to stifle their potential through bureaucracy.  
   - A notable example: Intel’s decision not to acquire Mellanox (later bought by Nvidia for $7B) is seen as a critical missed opportunity in AI infrastructure.  

### 2. **Technical Challenges and Ecosystem Weaknesses**
   - Nvidia’s dominance is attributed to its mature software stack (CUDA) and developer ecosystem, which Intel struggled to match. Habana’s hardware, while promising, lacked equivalent software support.  
   - Users note that AI accelerators require robust frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), and Intel’s fragmented efforts (Gaudi, Ponte Vecchio GPUs) failed to coalesce into a unified platform.  

### 3. **Cultural and Retention Issues**
   - Habana’s talent reportedly left after retention periods expired, reflecting Intel’s inability to retain innovators. This mirrors past failures where acquired teams clashed with Intel’s corporate structure.  
   - Some argue Intel’s management prioritized short-term financial goals over long-term R&D, leading to a "brain drain" of engineers and visionaries.  

### 4. **Broader Industry Context**
   - Comparisons to historical tech failures (e.g., Nortel’s collapse, Cisco’s acquisition strategy) underscore the difficulty of sustaining innovation in large corporations.  
   - Successful acquisitions (e.g., Google/YouTube, Nvidia/Mellanox) are contrasted with Intel’s struggles, emphasizing the importance of preserving a startup’s autonomy and culture post-acquisition.  

### 5. **Nvidia’s Strategic Edge**
   - Commenters highlight Nvidia’s early bets on AI (dating back to 2012 with AlexNet) and its ability to pivot from gaming GPUs to AI infrastructure. Intel’s delayed response and lack of cohesive strategy left it playing catch-up.  

### Final Takeaway  
The discussion paints Intel as a company hampered by internal dysfunction, missed opportunities, and an inability to adapt to the software-centric demands of modern AI. Habana Labs’ demise is seen as symptomatic of deeper issues, with Nvidia’s success underscoring the importance of ecosystem-building and visionary leadership. As one user succinctly put it: *"Intel correctly identified the AI future but failed to execute meaningfully."*
