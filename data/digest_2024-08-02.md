A thought-provoking discussion has emerged on Hacker News regarding whether the success of AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), supports philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claim that "meaning is use." The debate centers on whether the coherent and contextually relevant text generated by LLMs truly encapsulates meaning, as Wittgenstein posited that the meaning of a word is intrinsically linked to its contextual usage in language.

Several commenters weigh in, highlighting that while LLMs can produce language that appears meaningful due to their extensive training on diverse textual data, they lack true consciousness or an intrinsic understanding of the concepts they manipulate. One insightful perspective suggests that LLMs serve as intermediaries between human authors and users, utilizing learned contexts to create coherent language without genuine comprehension. Others contend that this raises questions about the authenticity of the 'meaning' produced since there's no underlying awareness or intent behind it.

In contrast, some participants argue that LLMs, when studied in the context of games or tasks like chess, exhibit a form of knowing through their ability to generate strategies and respond to inputs as if they understand a game board's layout. This introduces an intriguing challenge to the notion that linguistic ability alone guarantees a grasp of meaning.

The conversation not only delves into the philosophy of language but also reflects broader implications for AI's role in our understanding of communication, meaning, and intelligence. The discourse captures the complexity of defining meaning in the context of artificial intelligence, inviting further exploration into the fundamental nature of language and understanding.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the philosophical implications of AI's capability to generate language, specifically in relation to Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion that "meaning is use."
