### Linearizability: A correctness condition for concurrent objects

#### [Submission URL](http://muratbuffalo.blogspot.com/2024/08/linearizability-correctness-condition.html) | 50 points | by [matt_d](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=matt_d) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41207793)

In a deep dive into the seminal paper "Linearizability: A Correctness Condition for Concurrent Objects" by Herlihy and Wing, an analysis reveals the foundational concepts of linearizability, a key principle in concurrent computing. The paper, published in 1990, eschews introductory pleasantries and launches directly into the intricacies of concurrent systems, emphasizing the “object” model amid the burgeoning popularity of object-oriented programming at the time.

The author appreciates how the paper transcends simplistic read/write operations by utilizing a queue object for illustration, offering insights into the broader applications of linearizability beyond mere data types. The queue operations—enqueue and dequeue—are depicted with a focus on maintaining order and defining the boundaries of operation intervals, thereby showcasing the illusion of instantaneous execution in concurrent environments.

However, the author critiques certain ambiguities within the paper, particularly regarding atomicity in the queue's implementation and a seemingly inefficient naive queue model provided by the authors. Notably, the excitement around Theorem 1, which states that linearizability is a local property, contrasts with the more impressive second theorem highlighting linearizability as a nonblocking property, which assures that operations can proceed independently without interference from other pending invocations.

The discussion also distinguishes linearizability from serializability, emphasizing that while linearizability applies to single-object operations, it enables significant concurrency and efficiency that would be stifled in traditional serializability models.

Overall, the exploration of this classic paper underscores both the theoretical underpinnings of linearizability and its practical implications in concurrent programming, inviting both nostalgia for foundational work and a critical reassessment of its elements.

The discussion primarily critiques the linked article for its handling of consistency in distributed systems, particularly in relation to MongoDB's marketing claims. One commenter, kts, accuses the article of misclassifying certain concepts of consistency and not aligning effectively with Jepsen's analysis, which lends criticism to MongoDB. It is asserted that the article does not adequately address the nuances of consistency, highlighting a perceived lack of clarity in how certain terms and definitions are presented. Another commenter, _benedict, emphasizes that the linked article fails to properly discuss consistency as it relates to MongoDB, reinforcing kts’ concerns about the article’s depth and accuracy. The overall sentiment is one of disappointment regarding the article's treatment of crucial topics within the broader context of linearizability and distributed system properties.
