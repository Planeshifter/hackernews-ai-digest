Title: A Study Reveals Reliability Issues with Large Language Model Code Generation

Summary: A recent study conducted by Li Zhong and Zilong Wang examines the robustness and reliability of large language model (LLM) code generation. LLMs, known for their ability to understand natural language and generate programming code, are often consulted by software engineers for coding questions. However, the study highlights the potential problems that can arise from the misuse of APIs in the code generated by LLMs. The researchers collected coding questions from StackOverflow on 24 representative Java APIs and evaluated them on popular LLMs. The results show that even with GPT-4, 62% of generated code contained API misuses, which could lead to unexpected consequences when introduced into real-world software. The study calls for more attention to be given to the reliability and robustness of LLM-generated code, especially considering the vulnerability of novice developers who rely on these services.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the study on reliability issues with large language model (LLM) code generation covers several different perspectives and opinions.

- Some users express sympathy for GPT-4 and point out that mistakes in code generation are to be expected. They argue that the researchers' conclusions are not well-supported and that more specific considerations should be taken into account when evaluating LLMs.
- Others argue that the problem lies with human developers and their lack of understanding when it comes to proper exception handling, concurrency, and other programming concepts. They suggest that proper education and training should be a priority.
- Some users recommend reading books like "Effective Java" or "Java Concurrency in Practice" for a more thorough treatment of these topics.
- There is a discussion about the difficulty of detecting semantic bugs in code and the challenges of checking the correctness of code generated by LLMs, especially in complex scenarios.
- One user suggests that the misuse of APIs and semantic alignment issues are a particular problem in software engineering and that LLMs can exacerbate these issues.
- A few users point out that the study's examples and reasoning may not be grammatically correct or clear, and that language models like LLMs could benefit from grammar checks.
- There is also some skepticism about the future of LLMs and concerns that their use may lead to a decline in proper coding practices.

Overall, the discussion highlights the need for better understanding and education in software development and the challenges associated with code generation by large language models.

### PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742) | 113 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37285396)

The paper titled "PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer" by Xiaopeng Li and his co-authors proposes a new method for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). Model editing techniques modify a small portion of knowledge in LLMs at a low cost, and this paper aims to improve the precision of these edits.

Previous methods assumed that the hidden states of the Transformer Layer (TL) in LLMs are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These methods optimized the TL hidden states to remember target knowledge and used it to update the weights of the FFN. However, the TL hidden states contain information that is not specifically required for the FFN, and neglecting this fact reduces the performance of model editing.

To address this, the authors analyze the hidden states of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and FFN, and discover that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This finding suggests that the MHSA weights do not need to be updated when new knowledge is introduced. Based on this insight, the authors introduce PMET, which optimizes the hidden states of the Transformer Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN), while only using the optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights.

The experiments conducted demonstrate that PMET achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the enhancements introduced in PMET, emphasizing the finding that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and stores a small amount of factual knowledge.

Overall, the proposed PMET algorithm improves the precision of model editing in LLMs, offering potential advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has released Code Llama, an open-source language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Code Llama is designed for code completion, generation, and testing in languages like Python, C++, Java, and Bash. It was trained on 500 billion tokens of code and programming data and is available in three parameter sizes: 7-billion, 13-billion, and 34-billion. The 34B model achieved 48.8% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, surpassing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 models. Meta also released two fine-tuned versions for Python and natural language input. The 7B model can run on a single GPU.


The discussion about Meta's release of Code Llama on Hacker News includes a discussion about the commercial terms and licenses associated with the model. User "iFire" mentions that there are additional commercial terms for the Llama 2 version, and Meta grants certain rights at its discretion to licensees. User "acheong08" comments that it is reasonable for Meta to make a profit given the significant monthly active users (700 million) it serves. User "dmsk" adds a single-word comment of "dd" which is unclear in meaning.

Another aspect of the discussion revolves around the practicality of using the Code Llama language model. User "snttschl" mentions that they are waiting for a lightweight version of the model that can be run locally on a high-end GPU or even on a Raspberry Pi. User "jstnclft" raises the question of whether limitations would prevent the model from running on a Raspberry Pi, to which "klysm" replies that Pi's flip. User "snttschl" responds that they are attempting to be reasonably realistic in their expectations.

Lastly, user "snttschl" also comments separately about the benefits of using Code Llama, such as being able to generate good GPT4 code without a large codebase and at a lower cost compared to other options.

### It’s not intelligent if it always halts: A critical perspective on AI approaches

#### [Submission URL](https://www.lifeiscomputation.com/it-is-not-intelligent-if-it-always-halts/) | 43 points | by [optimalsolver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=optimalsolver) | [85 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37278189)

fall into category C. Currently, we don't have a way to determine which category the Collatz 5n+1 sequence falls into.

2. The Unintelligent Problem-Solver

Now that we've established the three types of computer programs, let's discuss what an unintelligent problem-solver looks like. An unintelligent problem-solver is a program that always halts for any problem given to it. It follows a strict set of instructions and executes them until it produces a solution or determines that there is no solution. This type of program does not have the ability to explore different paths or take arbitrary amounts of time to solve a problem.

For example, Program I, the Pythagorean triple program, is an unintelligent problem-solver. It follows a set of instructions to find a Pythagorean triple and eventually halts when it finds one. It cannot explore alternative paths or continue thinking about the problem beyond its instructions.

3. Making the Unintelligent Problem-Solver Intelligent

To make an unintelligent problem-solver intelligent, it needs to have the ability to explore different paths and potentially never-ending "trains of thought." Intelligence involves problem-solving, and problem-solving often requires arbitrary amounts of time to find a solution. An intelligent problem-solver should be able to continue thinking about a problem for as long as necessary without any predetermined time constraints.

4. Why Transformers Can't Be General Problem-Solvers

Transformer-based models, such as PaLM, BARD, and GPT-4, have gained popularity in the field of AI and are considered to be on the path to general intelligence. However, these models cannot be true general problem-solvers because they produce each word in their responses within a fixed amount of time. They do not have the ability to "think" or explore different paths before providing an answer.

In order to be truly intelligent, a model needs the capability to go away and think about a problem for as long as necessary, just like the example of the AI chatbot taking time to solve a tricky math problem. Transformers lack this ability, and therefore, cannot be considered "intelligent" in the true sense.

5. Addressing the Problem

To address this limitation, further research needs to be done on developing AI models that have the ability to explore never-ending trains of thought and take arbitrary amounts of time to solve problems. These models should not be constrained by fixed time limits but should be able to continue thinking until a satisfactory solution is reached.

By incorporating this type of exploration and problem-solving capability, we could move closer to achieving true general intelligence in AI systems.

Ultimately, true intelligence requires the ability to explore and think beyond predefined instructions or time limits. It is through this exploration that novel and creative solutions can be found.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the concept of general intelligence in artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Some users argue that AI models like Transformers can't be considered true general problem-solvers because they produce responses within fixed time limits and lack the ability to think and explore alternative paths. They suggest that further research is needed to develop AI models that can explore never-ending trains of thought and take arbitrary amounts of time to solve problems.

Other users point out that moving goalposts and constantly redefining intelligence can be frustrating. They argue that AI models have made significant advancements and can engage in conversations on various topics, which demonstrates their capabilities. However, there is disagreement over the definition and interpretation of intelligence in AI and whether the current techniques are sufficient to achieve true general intelligence.

Some users express skepticism about the notion of AI reaching the level of human intelligence or exhibiting empathy. They argue that AI is fundamentally different from human cognition and that attempts to anthropomorphize AI are misguided.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and ongoing debates surrounding the concept of general intelligence in AI systems.
