A recent study conducted by Li Zhong and Zilong Wang examines the robustness and reliability of large language model (LLM) code generation. LLMs, known for their ability to understand natural language and generate programming code, are often consulted by software engineers for coding questions. However, the study highlights the potential problems that can arise from the misuse of APIs in the code generated by LLMs. The researchers collected coding questions from StackOverflow on 24 representative Java APIs and evaluated them on popular LLMs. The results show that even with GPT-4, 62% of generated code contained API misuses, which could lead to unexpected consequences when introduced into real-world software. The study calls for more attention to be given to the reliability and robustness of LLM-generated code, especially considering the vulnerability of novice developers who rely on these services.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the study on reliability issues with large language model (LLM) code generation covers several different perspectives and opinions.
- Some users express sympathy for GPT-4 and point out that mistakes in code generation are to be expected. They argue that the researchers' conclusions are not well-supported and that more specific considerations should be taken into account when evaluating LLMs.
- Others argue that the problem lies with human developers and their lack of understanding when it comes to proper exception handling, concurrency, and other programming concepts. They suggest that proper education and training should be a priority.
- Some users recommend reading books like "Effective Java" or "Java Concurrency in Practice" for a more thorough treatment of these topics.
- There is a discussion about the difficulty of detecting semantic bugs in code and the challenges of checking the correctness of code generated by LLMs, especially in complex scenarios.
- One user suggests that the misuse of APIs and semantic alignment issues are a particular problem in software engineering and that LLMs can exacerbate these issues.
- A few users point out that the study's examples and reasoning may not be grammatically correct or clear, and that language models like LLMs could benefit from grammar checks.
- There is also some skepticism about the future of LLMs and concerns that their use may lead to a decline in proper coding practices.

Overall, the discussion highlights the need for better understanding and education in software development and the challenges associated with code generation by large language models.

### PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742) | 113 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37285396)

The paper titled "PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer" by Xiaopeng Li and his co-authors proposes a new method for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). Model editing techniques modify a small portion of knowledge in LLMs at a low cost, and this paper aims to improve the precision of these edits.

Previous methods assumed that the hidden states of the Transformer Layer (TL) in LLMs are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These methods optimized the TL hidden states to remember target knowledge and used it to update the weights of the FFN. However, the TL hidden states contain information that is not specifically required for the FFN, and neglecting this fact reduces the performance of model editing.

To address this, the authors analyze the hidden states of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and FFN, and discover that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This finding suggests that the MHSA weights do not need to be updated when new knowledge is introduced. Based on this insight, the authors introduce PMET, which optimizes the hidden states of the Transformer Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN), while only using the optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights.

The experiments conducted demonstrate that PMET achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the enhancements introduced in PMET, emphasizing the finding that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and stores a small amount of factual knowledge.

Overall, the proposed PMET algorithm improves the precision of model editing in LLMs, offering potential advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has released Code Llama, an open-source language model (LLM) that competes with OpenAI's ChatGPT. Code Llama is designed for code completion, generation, and testing in languages like Python, C++, Java, and Bash. It was trained on 500 billion tokens of code and programming data and is available in three parameter sizes: 7-billion, 13-billion, and 34-billion. The 34B model achieved 48.8% accuracy on the HumanEval benchmark, surpassing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 models. Meta also released two fine-tuned versions for Python and natural language input. The 7B model can run on a single GPU.

The discussion about Meta's release of Code Llama on Hacker News includes a discussion about the commercial terms and licenses associated with the model. User "iFire" mentions that there are additional commercial terms for the Llama 2 version, and Meta grants certain rights at its discretion to licensees. User "acheong08" comments that it is reasonable for Meta to make a profit given the significant monthly active users (700 million) it serves. User "dmsk" adds a single-word comment of "dd" which is unclear in meaning.

Another aspect of the discussion revolves around the practicality of using the Code Llama language model. User "snttschl" mentions that they are waiting for a lightweight version of the model that can be run locally on a high-end GPU or even on a Raspberry Pi. User "jstnclft" raises the question of whether limitations would prevent the model from running on a Raspberry Pi, to which "klysm" replies that Pi's flip. User "snttschl" responds that they are attempting to be reasonably realistic in their expectations.

Lastly, user "snttschl" also comments separately about the benefits of using Code Llama, such as being able to generate good GPT4 code without a large codebase and at a lower cost compared to other options.
