### Show HN: Agency – Unifying human, AI, and other computing systems, in Python

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/operand/agency) | 43 points | by [0perand](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=0perand) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36326587)

"Agency" is a Python framework for unifying human, AI, and traditional computing systems. The platform defines a common communication and action framework that allows shared environments called "spaces" to be established, where multiple agents can address each other as individuals and perform actions on each other. The framework handles the details of the common messaging protocol and allows discovering and invoking actions across all parties in the space. Users can integrate the framework with various systems, such as UI-driven applications, terminal environments, and other AI agents.

Comments on the post commend the author for creating an abstract framework that focuses on high-level thinking and objective choices. However, some users raise concerns regarding the GIL, single-process assembly, and difficulty in running Flask servers with child threads. The README is praised for being objective and easy to understand with quick and significant sample code. Several users also mention their excitement about the use of such a library in building integrated systems. One user expresses confusion about the feedback system, while another praises the flexibility of integrating various agents regardless of the system used, including non-Python projects.

### Native JSON Output from GPT-4

#### [Submission URL](https://yonom.substack.com/p/native-json-output-from-gpt-4) | 566 points | by [yonom](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yonom) | [237 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36330972)

OpenAI has released a new feature called function calling, which allows for GPT to call a function instead of returning a string. This makes it much simpler to generate structured data, such as JSONs, when integrating LLMs into products. By setting the function_call parameter, developers can reliably expect JSON as responses from GPT calls. This has implications for how we interact with OpenAI LLMs beyond plugins. This feature is available for the chat models gpt-3.5-turbo-0613 and gpt-4-0613.

The discussion delves into the potential security risks involved with ChatGPT directly connecting with SQL databases and the importance of implementing secure features built into databases. Some comments also talk about the uncertainty and lack of clarity in OpenAI's documentation regarding certain security measures and urge developers to take the necessary precautions. There is also a discussion about the potential capabilities of GPT-4 functioning as a transformation layer and how it could be used in developing secure chat applications. Furthermore, a comment describes a solution that utilizes JSON-based schema to ensure that the JSON structure is valid.

### Gorilla: Large Language Model Connected with APIs

#### [Submission URL](https://shishirpatil.github.io/gorilla/) | 234 points | by [throwaway888abc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwaway888abc) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36333290)

A team from UC Berkeley and Microsoft Research has developed Gorilla, a Large Language Model (LLM) that facilitates API calls more effectively. Gorilla uses three machine-learning hub datasets: Torch Hub, TensorFlow Hub, and HuggingFace, and incorporates domains like AWS, Kubernetes, OpenAPI, GCP, and more. Gorilla is Apache 2.0 licensed, allowing commercial usage without any obligations, and its models and code are available on GitHub. According to the researchers, Gorilla outperforms GPT-4, Chat-GPT, and Claude, while substantially mitigating the problem of hallucination, which is common when prompting LLMs directly. In the discussion, users congratulate the team on their achievement and ask questions about the licensing, performance, and implementation of Gorilla. Some users also compare Gorilla with other models like LangChain and suggest potential use cases for the tool.

### France’s Mistral AI raises a $113M seed round to take on OpenAI

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2023/06/13/frances-mistral-ai-blows-in-with-a-113m-seed-round-at-a-260m-valuation-to-take-on-openai/) | 170 points | by [rbrown](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbrown) | [138 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36326706)

Paris-based Mistral AI has secured $113m in seed funding to challenge OpenAI by offering open-source solutions for businesses to create large language models and generative AI. The four-week-old start-up will focus on delivering models generated using only publicly available data to reduce legal issues related to training data, said CEO Arthur Mensch, a former Google Deepmind employee. Mistral AI aims to release its first generative AI models by 2024. Lightspeed Venture Partners lead the funding round, with Index Ventures, Xavier Niel and Redpoint, among others, also participating. The $113m valuation of the firm has been confirmed. The commenters on the submission mostly discuss the merits of investing in Mistral AI or similar AI start-ups, with some comparing the company to DeepMind and OpenAI and others critiquing European investment strategies or praising French education.

### GPT-4-generated pitches are 3x more likely to secure funding than human ones

#### [Submission URL](https://www.zdnet.com/article/gpt-4-generated-pitches-are-3x-more-likely-to-secure-funding-than-human-ones/) | 39 points | by [gsibble](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gsibble) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36332196)

ChatGPT has been found to create more convincing investor pitch decks than humans, according to a study of 500 people conducted by small business lender Clarify Capital. The analysis found those polled were three times more likely to invest after reading the bot-generated deck than one made by people. Participants also found the AI decks twice as convincing. The survey tested the effectiveness of the decks across multiple industries, including finance, marketing and investment, with the GPT-4-based AI chatbot used in the study not revealed.

The discussion in the comments about the ChatGPT article reveals a mix of opinions. One commenter argues that AI-generated pitch decks do not realize the importance of being a human performance task. Another commenter wonders if investors are really interested in the underlying metrics that ChatGPT is optimizing on. However, another commenter contends that examples of business fundamentals are essential considerations for investors, and the underlying metrics that ChatGPT generates give it a distinct advantage. One commenter suggests that there is little difference between investors who would invest and those who would not invest in ChatGPT, while another commenter argues that sending an AI-generated pitch deck to 100 VCs and receiving a positive response as high as 3x is a significant advantage for startups. There is also a discussion about how some VCs may not correctly identify successful startups, and AI such as GPT-4 could help identify successful metrics. Finally, a commenter suggests that building AI works remarkably for the company.

### Vercel's AI Accelerator

Vercel has launched its AI Accelerator, a programme for early-stage startups and top AI innovators that offers access to over $850k worth of credits for top AI platforms such as Hugging Face and OpenAI. Participants in the programme can also benefit from weekly fireside chats, office hours, and access to a private community designed to foster collaboration and information sharing. In addition, the programme also includes an opportunity for a demo day with investors to showcase their work. Applications will be open for two weeks until June 30th, and the selected participants will begin a six-week programme starting on July 10th. The discussion in the comments section discussed issues such as Vercel's business model, NextJS, and the market for startup accelerators.
