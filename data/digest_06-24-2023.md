### Many in the AI field think the bigger-is-better approach is running out of road

#### [Submission URL](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/06/21/the-bigger-is-better-approach-to-ai-is-running-out-of-road) | 207 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [287 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36462282)

As the cost and strain of training and running AI models grows, researchers are beginning to focus on making these models more efficient, rather than simply larger. Instead of pursuing a bigger-is-better approach, the goal is to get more performance out of fewer resources. One approach is to optimize trade-offs, such as cutting the number of parameters but training models with more data, so they are smaller, faster, and cheaper to use. Another option is to use a similar rounding technique, which has been shown to cut down memory consumption, while some users are fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs to focus on a specific task. Google has invented a different option, which involves extracting specific knowledge from a larger model into a smaller, specialized one.

This submission discusses how researchers are focusing on making AI models more efficient rather than just bigger, and summarizes several techniques being used to achieve this. The comments section features a debate about the nature of language processing and the limits of deterministic systems in understanding and modeling language. Some participants argue that human language understanding is complex and probabilistic, and that current language models are limited in their ability to recognize nuanced meanings and higher level concepts. Others suggest that human reasoning is a deterministic process, and that deterministic systems can model language effectively given enough training data. There is also discussion about the potential and limitations of machine learning in emulating human cognitive processes and generating language.

This latest version offers additional features such as the ability to run CMD in Sandbox, open PDF files, purging WSB files, and more. Users may also customize their Sandbox configurations and choose which context menus to enable. The comments have discussed various issues and doubts regarding the tool and Windows Sandbox in general. One user suggested using a lightweight guest OS that is leveraged for host resources instead of containers. Another user shared how Linux can be used as a Sandbox. In contrast, someone else recommended using SELinux Sandbox VM, while another recommended using Kata containers. Finally, someone suggested using SandboxieEdit for better handling of Sandbox.

Semantic MediaWiki is a free, open-source extension to MediaWiki that enables data storage and querying within a wiki's pages. It also acts as a powerful knowledge management system with numerous spin-off extensions. Data created with SMW can be published via the Semantic Web, allowing for seamless integration with other systems. Recently, the SMW sponsorship program was initiated and version 4.1.1 was released. The software is used by a variety of organizations, including KM-A Knowledge Management Associates and Professional Wiki Wiki Services.

### Creating an autonomous system for fun and profit (2017)

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.thelifeofkenneth.com/2017/11/creating-autonomous-system-for-fun-and.html) | 83 points | by [bsilvereagle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bsilvereagle) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36459881)

In a blog post, a networking and systems engineer discussed how he set up his own autonomous system with twofold motivation: wanting to lower his monthly hosting expenses by sharing a rack with a friend in Hurricane Electric's data center, and a challenge to set it up as an autonomous system. The post explains how the internet is an interconnected fabric of separate networks and each network only interconnects with others in clearly defined places. The post will appeal to networking enthusiasts and those interested in setting up their own internet service provider or web hosting service.

### Visual Studio’s IntelliSense list can now steer GitHub Copilot code completions

#### [Submission URL](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/github-copilot-visual-studio-intellisense/) | 115 points | by [samwillis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samwillis) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36459827)

GitHub Copilot is now integrated with Visual Studio's IntelliSense list, making it even easier for developers to explore and find the code completions they need. With this integration, changing a selection in IntelliSense provides GitHub Copilot with additional context about the code, allowing for more accurate predictions and multi-line code completions. Users can accept a Copilot completion by pressing TAB, and IntelliSense member ranking can also steer Copilot predictions. This update also allows for multi-line predictions to be previewed by pressing the Left CTRL button, and users are required to manually update to version 1.84 of Copilot.

### The Magic of Embeddings

#### [Submission URL](https://stack.convex.dev/the-magic-of-embeddings) | 113 points | by [gk1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gk1) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36454494)

Have you ever wondered how AI models can compare the meaning of two text strings? The answer is through embeddings, which are lists of numbers that describe a piece of text. By comparing these embeddings, we can search, cluster, recommend, classify, and even measure diversity among text strings. In this article, the writer takes a closer look at using OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model to obtain embeddings, and how to efficiently store and search them using Pinecone or the Convex database. Whether you're working with text strings, images, or audio, embeddings can help unlock their hidden similarities and associations.

The submission discusses embeddings, which are used in AI to compare similarities between text strings, images, or audio. OpenAI's text-embedding-ada-002 model is used to obtain embeddings, and Pinecone or Convex database are used to efficiently store and search them. Commenters discuss the limitations of Google's semantic understanding and suggest alternative search methods, the challenges of cross-domain work with embeddings, and the trade-off between vector length and computational efficiency. Some commenters share positive experiences with embeddings in their work, and recommend databases like Convex for vector search.

In his latest article "Semantic Compression", Casey Muratori discusses the problem with object-oriented programming and the need for experienced programmers to share their coding techniques. He provides examples from his work on The Witness's editor code and details a set of straightforward code transformations he made to improve its structure. Muratori argues that good programming should be shared and that there is a need to move away from the "objectively bad" educational materials that currently dominate the field.

Casey Muratori's article on "Semantic Compression" that discusses the problems with object-oriented programming and the need for sharing good coding practices receives mixed reactions in the Hacker News community. Some criticized the author's claims that OOP is bad, while others appreciated the value of sharing good programming techniques. Several commenters suggested that the article wasn't a substantial contribution to programming literature, while others recommended similar books like 'How to Design Programs.' There were also discussions about other programming languages like Python, Rust, and C++ in the context of OOP. Some users appreciated the article's advice on DRY programming, while others pointed out that it is not always the right approach for some cases.
