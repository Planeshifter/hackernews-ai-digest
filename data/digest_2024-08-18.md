### Markov chains are funnier than LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://emnudge.dev/blog/markov-chains-are-funny/) | 424 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [192 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41286203)

In an intriguing exploration of humor and artificial intelligence, a recent article posits that Markov chains – the basic building blocks of predictive text – can actually generate funnier outputs than large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By contrasting the two, the author illustrates how Markov chains, despite being simpler and less sophisticated, can create unexpected and thus humorous results.

The article begins with an example where a Markov chain produces a nonsensical yet amusing sentence by mixing language from the King James Bible and computer science, while ChatGPT generates a more coherent but ultimately less surprising sentence. This leads to the thesis that humor hinges on "unserious surprise," which is often achieved by violating expectations, something Markov chains can do by their unpredictable nature.

As the author delves deeper into the mechanics of humor, they define it as rooted in the element of surprise—highlighting that jokes that deviate from expected patterns tend to elicit more laughter. In contrast, LLMs, which rely heavily on context and statistical probability to generate text, often produce "soulless" outputs that lack creativity and spontaneity. They essentially generate the "most average" response rather than something original or surprising.

Ultimately, the article champions the idea that humor can be quantitatively assessed, making a case for the charm of randomness in Markov chains, and how their erratic outputs can spark genuine laughter in ways that LLMs may struggle to capture. The piece invites readers to reconsider the nature of comedy in the age of advanced AI, suggesting that sometimes, the simplest tools can lead to the most delightful surprises.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the humorous comparison between Markov chains and large language models (LLMs) in generating funny content. Several users reflect on experiences where they found Markov-generated text amusing due to its absurdity and unpredictability, particularly noting that while Markov chains can produce entertaining nonsense, LLMs often yield more coherent but less surprising outputs. One commenter recounts their use of a Markov generator for blog posts, likening its results to "word soup," yet finds them more delightful compared to standard LLM-generated content that tends to lack flair.

Many comments touch on the theme that humor relies on unexpected twists, with Markov chains meeting this criterion effectively through randomness. Others discuss their historical use of Markov generators in chat contexts, emphasizing the distinctive and unpredictable flavor of the text they produce. A notable dialogue compares specific examples of humor, with user-created jokes highlighting the differences between the two approaches to humor.

Some users analyze the evolving conversation around AI in humor, pointing out the necessity for machines to balance randomness with coherence. They suggest that while LLMs aim to create sensible responses, they often miss out on the delightful absurdities that simpler algorithms like Markov chains can provide. Several participants convey a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the charm of earlier text-generation techniques, suggesting that there may still be value in the chaotic creativity of Markov models over the polished outputs of contemporary LLMs.

### Prompt Caching

#### [Submission URL](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/prompt-caching) | 158 points | by [fallinditch](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fallinditch) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41284639)

Anthropic has exciting news for developers: they are launching a public beta for a new feature called **Prompt Caching** that significantly improves API efficiency. This tool allows users to cache specific portions of their prompts, such as large texts or static instructions, making interactions faster and less costly. 

With Prompt Caching, users can reuse previously cached content across multiple API calls, reducing processing time when dealing with repetitive prompts or extensive context. For example, the entire text of “Pride and Prejudice” can be cached, allowing for various analyses on themes or character insights without the need to reprocess the text each time. 

Developers can implement this feature using a straightforward caching mechanism in their API requests, and the system automatically checks for cached prompts to accelerate response times. 

As a new pricing structure is introduced, cached content is billed at a lower rate, promoting greater cost-effectiveness for frequent tasks. Supported models include Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3.0 Haiku, with further enhancements expected in the future. 

The beta phase encourages user feedback, inviting developers to tweak and optimize their use of this powerful new feature for better performance in tasks ranging from extensive document analysis to coding assistance. This development is set to streamline workflows and improve interaction quality with Anthropic’s AI tools.

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Many commenters expressed concern about the costs associated with caching large datasets, comparing it to standard storage costs with S3 and Elasticache. Some highlighted the surprising expense of caching millions of tokens, while others noted that a caching layer could potentially reduce these costs if managed effectively.

2. **Technical Details**: Technical discussions centered around the specifics of key-value (KV) caching, where users calculated the memory implications of various transformer model configurations. The calculations showed substantial differences in memory usage depending on model architecture, which could affect performance and costs.

3. **Performance Considerations**: Several users reflected on the performance benefits of caching. The consensus was that caching could drastically reduce processing times for prompts that require extensive context, improving overall interaction efficiency with AI tools.

4. **Feedback and Implementation**: The beta phase of the feature was mentioned, with users encouraged to provide feedback to refine the implementation. This feedback loop is seen as crucial for optimizing how developers can leverage caching in their workflows.

5. **Competitive Landscape**: Some comments alluded to competitors in the space, with references to how similar features could reshape market dynamics and the potential advantages of Anthropic's offerings.

Overall, the discussion embraced both technical and economic facets of the new caching feature, revealing both excitement about its potential and caution regarding the calculated costs involved.
