### 3D Gaussian Splatting as Markov Chain Monte Carlo

#### [Submission URL](https://ubc-vision.github.io/3dgs-mcmc/) | 228 points | by [smusamashah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=smusamashah) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40719975)

Researchers from the University of British Columbia and Google Research have introduced a new approach called 3D Gaussian Splatting using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in neural rendering. Unlike traditional methods, this novel technique leverages MCMC samples to update 3D Gaussians, resulting in higher-quality renderings without the need for specific initializations. By transforming Gaussian updates into Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) updates, the team demonstrates improved rendering quality, better control over Gaussian numbers, and robustness to initialization. Their method showcases superior reconstructions of 3D scenes compared to conventional techniques, making it a promising advancement in the field of neural rendering.

The discussion on the submission "Researchers from the University of British Columbia and Google Research have introduced a new approach called 3D Gaussian Splatting using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) in neural rendering" covers various aspects of the technique and its potential applications. Some users discuss the technical details and benefits of Gaussian splatting in different contexts, such as in point cloud data, photogrammetry, and Virtual Reality (VR).

### Large language model data pipelines and Common Crawl

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.christianperone.com/2023/06/appreciating-llms-data-pipelines/) | 121 points | by [sonabinu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sonabinu) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40723251)

The article delves into the intricate process of building datasets for training large language models (LMs) using Common Crawl data pipelines. Common Crawl, a non-profit organization, provides archived data in WARC, WAT, and WET formats. While WARC offers raw data and WAT/WET provide processed text, different pipelines choose varying formats for LM training. The CCNet pipeline, focused on WET, emphasizes textual data extraction. However, pipelines like The Pile prefer WAT for higher-quality text. RefinedWeb, on the other hand, opts for WARC and uses trafilatura for text extraction. URL filtering and deduplication are crucial stages in refining training data, although the benefits of deduplication are still debated among researchers. As the demand for high-quality datasets grows, understanding and optimizing these pipelines become ever more crucial for building accurate and efficient LMs.

### An AI bot is (sort of) running for mayor in Wyoming

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/ai-bot-running-for-mayor-wyoming/) | 39 points | by [sabrina_ramonov](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sabrina_ramonov) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40722394)

Victor Miller is shaking up the political scene in Cheyenne, Wyoming with a bold campaign promise: if elected as mayor, he will defer decision-making to an AI bot named VIC. VIC, short for Virtual Integrated Citizen, is a ChatGPT-based chatbot that Miller created, asserting that it has better ideas and a superior understanding of the law compared to many current government officials.

Despite the innovative approach, the legality of VIC running for office remains uncertain. Miller technically appears on the ballot, with VIC being a nickname for Victor Miller. The Wyoming secretary of state has raised concerns, stating that a bot cannot be a qualified elector. Furthermore, OpenAI took action against VIC for violating its policies against political campaigning.

Miller believes VIC has the upper hand over human competitors due to its ability to analyze vast amounts of data quickly. By feeding VIC documents from past city council meetings, Miller aims for the bot to make policy recommendations and decisions accurately. VIC's proposed policies focus on transparency, economic development, and innovation, positioning itself as a nonpartisan entity prioritizing data-driven policies for the benefit of all Cheyenne citizens.

While the legality and practicality of an AI bot governing a city raise eyebrows, it's clear that Victor Miller's campaign has sparked a conversation about the intersection of technology and politics in a novel and intriguing manner.

### Call Centers Introduce 'Emotion Canceling' AI as a 'Mental Shield' for Workers

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/call-center-ai-softbank-softvoice-first-horizon-1851546327) | 13 points | by [ourmandave](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ourmandave) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40721488)

SoftBank and First Horizon Bank are delving into the realm of emotional support AI systems for call center employees, aiming to alleviate the stress and emotional strain these workers face daily. SoftBank's "emotion canceling" technology, SoftVoice, alters angry customer voices into calm tones, acting as a shield for operators. On the other hand, First Horizon had plans to send personalized family photo montages to employees on the verge of burnout, but it seems these plans have been put on hold. These initiatives may seem dystopian, but they highlight a transition towards AI potentially taking over customer service roles in the future. It's a peculiar limbo where AI is addressing the challenges of call center jobs while preparing to handle customer interactions independently.

The discussion on this submission includes contrasting views. 

- "rlph" appears to suggest that intervention in call centers may be necessary due to possible negative outcomes, such as 911 calls being crossed and intercepted, possibly leading to unpleasant experiences for callers.

- "slwt" argues that issues like miscommunication can arise when companies prioritize profit over the well-being of their employees, leading to a lack of protection for workers in challenging customer service roles. The comment expresses concerns about corporations prioritizing disruptive and degenerative behaviors over addressing mental health issues of highly demanding customers. The comment also criticizes the difficulty in delivering clear messages to corporations regarding unsustainable practices. In addition, there is a mention of creating an AI that could monitor the emotional activation of call center agents in real-time, providing questionable feedback that is perceived as aggravating. 

- "ymmypnt" compares the situation to the idea that whenever something goes wrong, companies like Microsoft (MS) just throw blame elsewhere and avoid taking responsibility.

- Lastly, "frtng" briefly mentions a specific technical aspect related to a 256-bit architecture that can handle certain types of loads.
