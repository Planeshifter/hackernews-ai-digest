### Discord's face scanning age checks 'start of a bigger shift'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo) | 295 points | by [1659447091](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=1659447091) | [366 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715884)

In a move that's causing quite a stir, Discord is testing facial recognition software to verify the ages of some users in the UK and Australia. This initiative comes in response to the UK’s upcoming online safety laws, which require platforms hosting adult content to implement strong age verification measures by July. Technology experts suggest this shift is just the beginning of a broader trend toward enhanced verification processes online.

Matt Navarra, a social media expert, describes age assurance as “the new seatbelt for the internet,” stating that platforms failing to implement effective age checks risk losing users and facing legal consequences. Companies like Instagram have already paved the way by using AI to estimate user age through selfie videos, and Discord is following suit by offering users the choice of using a face scanner or photo ID for age verification.

The practice is not without controversy. Privacy advocates, including Big Brother Watch, argue that such technology presents risks, including potential security breaches and privacy intrusions. Despite these concerns, regulators and age verification bodies see a variety of methods available that they claim protect privacy and accurately estimate age.

Australia, on a parallel track, is moving towards banning social media for users under 16, noting that over 80% of children between 8 and 12 are already active on platforms meant for older users. This illustrates a global push for more stringent online safety protocols for younger internet users.

As these changes unfold, age verification becomes vital not just for user protection but as a critical compliance measure for companies facing significant financial penalties for non-compliance. This new era might signal the end of simple checkboxes confirming age, marking a profound evolution in how internet safety is managed.

Meanwhile, Discord is under pressure from legal fronts as well, with New Jersey's attorney general suing the company over alleged misleading safety controls. As the digital world adapts to new safety and privacy standards, the spotlight remains squarely on platforms like Discord and their handling of sensitive content access.

The discussion revolves around Discord's implementation of facial recognition for age verification and broader debates on online safety, privacy, and regulation. Key points include:

1. **Technical Challenges**:  
   Users highlight encryption technologies (TLS, DoH, ECH) as barriers to content filtering, making age verification technically complex. Critics argue that modern protocols and decentralized tools (VPNs, peer-to-peer networks) render traditional filtering methods ineffective, allowing minors to bypass restrictions.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Debates**:  
   References to the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and its overturning by the Supreme Court underscore historical tensions between regulation and free speech. Skepticism persists about new laws, with users questioning their enforceability and potential to create privacy risks (e.g., biometric data breaches).

3. **Parental vs. Governmental Responsibility**:  
   Some argue that parents, not governments or platforms, should oversee children’s online activity. Critics of strict regulation warn of "Orwellian" surveillance, while others advocate for client-side filtering tools or movements like "Wait Until 8th" (delaying smartphones until age 14). Schools’ struggles to manage device use in classrooms also reflect broader societal challenges.

4. **Privacy Concerns**:  
   Facial recognition and biometric verification are criticized as invasive, with fears that data could be exploited by third parties or governments. Comparisons are drawn to past privacy failures, such as Google’s anonymized data being re-identified.

5. **Societal and Cultural Shifts**:  
   Discussions note the normalization of early tech exposure, with children accessing explicit content despite restrictions. Some users emphasize social pressures and the difficulty of controlling peer-driven behavior, while others blame lax parenting or cultural individualism.

6. **Skepticism Toward Solutions**:  
   Age verification is seen as a flawed "check-the-box" compliance measure, unlikely to deter determined minors. Critics suggest the focus should shift to education and harm reduction rather than unenforceable bans.

The conversation reflects a clash between technological feasibility, privacy rights, and the practicality of regulating online behavior, with no clear consensus on effective solutions.

### Differentiable Programming from Scratch

#### [Submission URL](https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/) | 101 points | by [sksxihve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sksxihve) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713140)

Differentiable programming is revolutionizing various fields well beyond machine learning. While systems like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX have propelled its use in machine learning, this approach is now making waves in areas like computer graphics with innovations such as differentiable rendering, differentiable physics, and neural representations. Recognized in 3Blue1Brown’s Summer of Math Exposition 2, a recent article sheds light on this increasingly vital tool for tackling complex optimization problems.

To grasp differentiable programming, one must revisit key mathematical concepts starting with differentiation. The derivative, a staple of calculus, measures how a function's output changes with a tiny input variation. For instance, in one-dimensional functions, it represents the function's slope at a given point.

However, in higher dimensions, this concept transforms: the derivative becomes a map turning input vectors into output vectors. Take a function of two variables, for instance, which yields partial derivatives that together form the gradient—a vector indicating the direction of steepest ascent.

Understanding these mathematical underpinnings is crucial for implementing differentiable programming techniques effectively. Moreover, with the advent of automatic differentiation methods like forward and backward modes, programming for differentiation has become more streamlined, enabling applications such as image de-blurring and other optimization tasks in coding.

Differentiable programming is also about managing how function compositions are differentiated, employing the chain rule to handle more complex functions. When diving deeper, differentiable programming involves augmenting numerical and symbolic differentiation with sophisticated automatic differentiation techniques.

This expansion into various scientific and technological domains underscores the potential and importance of differentiable programming. As these methodologies continue to evolve and find new applications, they promise to further enhance our ability to solve intricate problems across disciplines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Differentiable Programming:**

The discussion highlights the historical roots, technical challenges, and modern debates surrounding differentiable programming (DP) and automatic differentiation (AD). Key points include:

1. **Historical Context**:  
   - DP/AD is not new; its foundations trace back to the 1960s–1990s, with early work in FORTRAN, contributions by Louis Rall (1981), and Andreas Griewank (2000). Critics note that modern ML/AI researchers often overlook or fail to cite this prior work, leading to concerns about academic integrity and "reinventing the wheel."

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **Numerical Stability**: Finite-difference methods face instability in high-dimensional spaces, with risks of catastrophic cancellation and computational infeasibility.  
   - **State and Purity**: AD requires functions to be "pure" (stateless) for reliable differentiation. Managing stateful variables or dynamic control flow (e.g., loops with variable iterations) complicates derivative calculations.  
   - **Compositionality**: Chain-rule applications in complex functions can fail if components violate derivative rules (e.g., adversarial compositions), though certain cases (eigenvalue derivatives) remain valid if phase choices are consistent.

3. **Language and Implementation**:  
   - AD can be integrated into existing languages (e.g., JavaScript, F#’s DiffSharp) without needing new domain-specific languages (DSLs). Functional programming paradigms simplify AD due to their emphasis on purity, but challenges persist in handling mutable state or optimizing memory in reverse-mode AD.  
   - Some argue that "differentiable programming" is more about augmenting existing systems with AD tools rather than inventing entirely new frameworks.

4. **Critique of Modern Research**:  
   - Participants criticize the ML community for neglecting historical literature, with anecdotes of researchers repackaging old ideas without proper attribution. This underscores a broader tension between rapid innovation and academic rigor.

In summary, while differentiable programming is driving advances in ML and beyond, the discussion emphasizes its deep historical roots, persistent technical hurdles, and the need for greater acknowledgment of foundational work.

### Building an AI that watches rugby

#### [Submission URL](https://nickjones.tech/ai-watching-rugby/) | 83 points | by [reddavis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reddavis) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714902)

In an intriguing leap towards smarter sports analysis, Gainline, a rugby-centric app, is navigating the challenge of providing deeper insights into rugby games. While existing data covers the major events like tries and cards, it falls short in explaining why they happen. This gap in context is critical for fans who crave a more immersive second-screen experience.

The team behind Gainline embarked on an innovative journey to address this challenge—by developing a prototype AI capable of watching rugby games and extracting rich, contextual data directly from the visuals. The prototype hinges on OpenAI's vision model, which analyzes screenshots taken every five seconds from game footage. This AI doesn't just tell us who scored; it deciphers phases of play, game time, and team kits, restructuring them into readily usable data formats like JSON.

One of the primary experiments involved efficiently extracting key information like scores and game times. Instead of sending the model full-resolution screenshots (a costly endeavor), the team cleverly reduced the data size by cropping images to just focus on the scoreboard, a practical solution that significantly cut down on computational costs without needing fanciful image processing methods.

To add efficiency, an intriguing "diffing" method was contemplated—comparing frames to isolate and identify changes, like the scoreboard, using basic image comparison techniques. While still a work in progress, these minimalist approaches exemplify the project's ethos of simplicity over complexity.

This initiative opens a new horizon for rugby fans, promising rich narratives woven from AI-generated insights. The endeavor reflects a broader trend in sports analytics: harnessing AI not just for what's happening on the field, but to understand the nuanced stories behind the whistles and passes. As Gainline refines these techniques, the prospects for AI-enhanced sports viewing look brighter than ever.

In the dynamic world of artificial intelligence, OpenAI recently eyed acquisition opportunities among emerging AI startups, with a focus on innovative coding tools. Initially, the ChatGPT developer approached Cursor, a product by Anysphere, for a potential deal. However, after negotiations with Anysphere fizzled, OpenAI shifted its interest to Windsurf, a rival AI coding startup, with a staggering $3 billion proposal, marking what could be OpenAI's largest acquisition.

Cursor has created waves in the tech industry as an AI-backed coding assistant, leveraging models from Anthropic. Its efficiency in "vibe coding," a term popularized by OpenAI's own co-founder Andrej Karpathy, has captivated a million daily users as of March. Despite its burgeoning success and a strong market position, Cursor did not seal a deal with OpenAI, even amidst Anysphere's ongoing talks to raise funding at a valuation close to $10 billion.

OpenAI's decision comes alongside the release of their new o3 and o4-mini reasoning models, touted by CEO Sam Altman as exceptional for coding. The models are set to simplify usage through Codex CLI, yet another product likely to heat up the AI coding competition. Meanwhile, other major tech players are busily investing in vast data centers to support the burgeoning demand for AI-driven software solutions. 

Anysphere, founded in 2022 and boasting over $100 million in recurring revenue, is backed by prominent investors, including Andreessen Horowitz and the OpenAI Startup Fund. As the AI landscape continues to evolve, companies like OpenAI are striving to harness the best tools and technologies that will drive the future of coding and beyond.

**Hacker News Daily Digest: OpenAI’s AI Coding Ambitions and Community Discussion**

**Submission Summary**  
OpenAI explored acquiring AI coding startups, first targeting Anysphere’s Cursor (an AI coding tool built on Anthropic models with 1M daily users). After negotiations stalled, OpenAI shifted to a rumored $3B bid for rival Windsurf. Meanwhile, OpenAI released new coding-focused models (o3/o4-mini) and Codex CLI, intensifying competition in AI-assisted coding. Anysphere, backed by major investors, is valued near $10B, highlighting the sector’s growth. Other tech giants are investing heavily in AI infrastructure.

**Discussion Highlights**

2. **AI Tools in Practice**:  
   - Cursor (a VS Code fork) faced mixed reviews: users praised its efficiency but noted issues with error correction and “vibe coding” limitations. Gemini 1.5 Pro’s context-window improvements were seen as a potential fix.  
   - Skepticism arose about AI’s ability to replace developers. While tools like A-SWE (Agentic Software Engineer) could handle tasks like code writing and testing, users argued they lack the judgment and adaptability of skilled engineers. One analogy: AI-generated code risks becoming a “recipe book” loop without human feedback.  

3. **CFO’s Role & Vaporware Concerns**:  
   - OpenAI’s CFO discussing A-SWE drew scrutiny, with some calling it “vaporware” until tangible results emerge. Speculation arose about investor hype versus real utility.  

4. **Data & Training Challenges**:  
   - Quality training data is critical. Professional developer input and real-world coding interactions are seen as essential for AI models to progress. Fears of “AI-generated knowledge loops” (models trained on synthetic data) causing stagnation were debated.
