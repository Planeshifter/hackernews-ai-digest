### Maximal Min() and Max()

#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/983965/3266dc25bf5c68d7/) | 60 points | by [immibis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=immibis) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41182917)

In a recent examination of the Linux kernel's use of preprocessor macros, particularly the min() and max() functions, Jonathan Corbet highlights an intriguing issue impacting compilation times. Originally designed to simplify comparisons, these macros have undergone numerous changes, with their complexity increasing significantly over time. 

The problems were brought to light by Arnd Bergmann, who noted that recent compilation had ballooned, with one file taking 15 seconds just to pass through the preprocessor. The nested structure of the min() and max() macros, particularly through the min3() function which further compounds their usage, led to an astonishing 47MB output from a single line of code due to excessive expansions. 

This complexity is of great concern since kernel developers prioritize efficient build times. Following the recognition of this growing issue, developers swiftly responded with proposed patches aimed at streamlining macro expansion and ultimately reducing compilation times. The discussion underscores an ongoing balancing act within kernel development, where striving for type safety and flexibility must also yield efficient performance. As patch series emerge, it remains to be seen how effectively these issues will be resolved, ensuring both the robustness and efficiency of kernel builds.

The discussion surrounding the issue with the Linux kernel's complex preprocessor macros, specifically the min() and max() functions, reveals a variety of perspectives from contributors. Some express concern about the macros' increasing complexity over time, which has led to significantly longer compilation times, with instances of single files taking up to 15 seconds through preprocessing. Users noted that the extensive expansion of such macros resulted in outputs as large as 47MB.

Contributors debated the implications of using nested macros, questioning their impact on compilation efficiency and type compatibility. Some advocated for a shift towards solutions that might minimize macro complexity, citing that the issues are particularly evident in specific development environments, such as with GCC and C++ features. Others expressed caution about potential changes that could affect the robustness and predictability of the kernel's performance.

Discussion also highlighted the balance between striving for code maintainability and keeping compilation times efficient. Several users proposed alternatives to the current usage of macros, suggesting that better practices could mitigate the adverse effects on compilation times without sacrificing functional integrity. Overall, the comments reveal a community grappling with the trade-offs between macro utility and system performance, while also calling for heightened awareness about the design and implementation of macros in critical systems like the Linux kernel.

### Robot Dog with Gun Turret for Hunting Aerial Drones Being Tested by Army

The U.S. Army is trialing a high-tech "robot dog" equipped with an AR-15-type carbine as part of an operation focused on countering drone threats. This innovative quadrupedal unmanned ground vehicle, developed by Ghost Robotics, is taking center stage at Operation Hard Kill, a live-fire exercise aimed at enhancing anti-drone capabilities in response to lessons learned from conflicts such as the war in Ukraine. 

The Vision 60 robot dog features a turret with advanced targeting systems, including infrared technology and a laser aiming device, enabling it to engage aerial targets efficiently. Operators can control the weaponry remotely, which may include features for automated targeting. This development aligns with military strategies to leverage autonomous technologies for security missions in urban settings, allowing robotic forces to scout and secure areas without exposing personnel to danger.

The Army’s 10th Mountain Division is leading this initiative at Fort Drum, showcasing various counter-drone systems, including an equipped Containerized Weapon System and a version of the Rheinmetall Mission Master vehicle. These trials reflect an increasing reliance on robotic systems to handle emerging aerial threats, with armed robot dogs potentially becoming a fixture in the arsenal against uncrewed aerial systems in the near future.

The discussion surrounding the U.S. Army's trial of a high-tech "robot dog" seems to center on mixed opinions and reactions regarding the implications of armed robotic systems in military operations. Key points from the comments include:

1. **Robotic Hunting and Troop Safety**: Some users express concerns about the ethical ramifications and practicality of using robot dogs equipped with firearms, likening them to futuristic hunting machines in scenarios similar to classic video games.

2. **Technological Capabilities**: Discussions touch on the capabilities of these robotic platforms, including their weight, payload, and targeting technology. Users compare the Ghost Robotics platform's functionality against more conventional systems, illustrating the advancements in combat robotics.

3. **Taken from Popular Culture**: References to movies like "Robocop" and video games like "Horizon Zero Dawn" highlight how cultural influences shape perceptions of military technology, suggesting a mix of fascination and caution regarding autonomous weapons.

4. **Counter-Drone Operations**: Many comments highlight the significance of counter-drone capabilities, debating whether robotic systems could effectively replace human soldiers in certain missions, especially in urban warfare scenarios.

5. **Concerns About Future Use**: There is apprehension regarding the long-term implications of deploying armed robots, including potential use against civilians and the moral ramifications of unmanned combat.

Overall, the discussion reflects a blend of intrigue and apprehension about the intersection of military technology and ethics, as well as the ongoing evolution of unmanned systems in warfare.

### Where Facebook's AI Slop Comes From

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/) | 68 points | by [colinprince](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=colinprince) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41179197)

In a revealing exposé, Jason Koebler highlights Facebook's controversial practice of incentivizing creators in India, Vietnam, and the Philippines to produce shockingly bizarre AI-generated content that mimics viral social media trends. With guides on crafting such content circulated via YouTube and Telegram, creators are profiting handsomely from emotionally charged posts featuring images of malnourished individuals and surreal AI-rendered homes. The goal? To elicit high engagement through likes and shares, essential for maximizing revenue. One case featured a Facebook page that purportedly earned $100 for every 1,000 likes, showcasing the platform's troubling intersection with exploitative content creation. The article raises important questions about the ethical implications of this AI-fueled economy and its impact on global audiences.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around Jason Koebler's article about Facebook's practice of incentivizing creators in lower-income countries to generate AI-driven, attention-grabbing content. Participants express concerns over the ethical implications and the effects on content quality. Users critique how creators are pressured to produce lower-quality, viral content that exploits emotional triggers and mundane realities, which can lead to a devaluation of genuine creativity.

Several commenters emphasize the negative impact on authentic creators who produce original content, noting that they are often overshadowed by those generating appealing yet shallow AI-generated posts. There is a shared sentiment about the sustainability of such practices, with some arguing that Facebook is prioritizing engagement over quality and ethical content.

Additionally, the dialogue touches upon broader themes of monetization strategies on social platforms, the commodification of content, and how incentives shape the landscape of online creativity. Some discussions highlight the retroactive evaluation of economic systems, comparing current practices to past advertising models that also led to a proliferation of low-quality output. Overall, the conversation encapsulates a rich debate about the direction of content creation on social media and the potential exploitation of creators driven by profit motives.
