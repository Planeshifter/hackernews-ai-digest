A developer has created an innovative proof-of-concept aimed at assisting visually impaired individuals by providing real-time descriptions of their surroundings using a modestly priced setup. By harnessing the ESP32-CAM, an affordable camera module with built-in WiFi, paired with a smartphone and a server, the project captures images and employs an AI model to relay scene descriptions through voice synthesis.

The low-cost ($30) solution was driven by a desire to address the high prices of existing tools for the blind, which can soar into the thousands. Although the prototype has some limitations—such as the need for a handheld setup and a web page open on the phone for updates—the developer is optimistic about improving the design, perhaps envisioning a more user-friendly version that could be integrated into glasses for better mobility.

Initial tests have shown promising results with some challenges regarding the description quality, which tended to include superfluous information about weather and location. However, with refined prompts, the accuracy of the scene descriptions has improved. The entire process has demonstrated feasibility, running efficiently at a very low operational cost.

This project not only showcases the potential of DIY technology to enhance accessibility but also underscores a growing movement towards more affordable assistive devices, paving the way for future advancements in this vital area.

### Self driving 1993 Volvo with open pilot

#### [Submission URL](https://practicapp.com/carbagepilot-part1/) | 612 points | by [trainsarebetter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trainsarebetter) | [134 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42592910)

In an adventurous endeavor, Robbe Derks and friends are transforming a 1993 Volvo 940 Estate into a self-driving vehicle for the Carbage Run 2025 Winter Edition, a quirky competition that mandates participants to drive “carbage” cars—those older than 20 years and valued under €1000—on a challenging 6000km trek through the icy expanse of Scandinavia. 

This ambitious project leverages the open-source technology from comma.ai, which typically enables modern vehicles with electronic controls to gain partial self-driving capabilities via openpilot. However, the 1993 Volvo presents a unique challenge: it lacks the necessary electronic actuators for functions like steering, acceleration, and braking.

Focusing on the steering system first, the team is retrofitting an electric power steering (EPS) actuator from a 2020 Toyota Corolla. This swap requires intricate mechanical adaptations, including the modification of the original steering column to accommodate the new EPS motor and an external steering angle sensor, essential for accurate car control. 

Though integrating the EPS means the Volvo will initially retain its hydraulic assist system, Derks notes potential issues with the torque leading to wear over time. Nonetheless, the combined systems are currently operational, making the steering feel lighter. With these mechanical upgrades, the project is set to advance, and further insights on wiring and electrical integration will follow in subsequent updates. This innovative venture not only showcases engineering ingenuity but also embodies the spirit of creativity and exploration inherent in the tech and automotive communities.

In a recent discussion on Hacker News about Robbe Derks' project to convert a 1993 Volvo 940 Estate into a self-driving car, participants engaged in various aspects of automotive engineering and modification. 

**Key Points from the Discussion:**

1. **Vehicle Design and Features**: Users expressed admiration for the Volvo's design and engineering heritage, discussing how Volvo models from the 1960s to 1990s are considered solid platforms. Some highlighted specific challenges and modifications related to braking systems and steering controls.

2. **Challenges of Retrofitting**: Several commenters noted the complexities of retrofitting modern components, such as the electrical systems for steering and brakes, into the older Volvo. The integration of modern ABS systems and electric steering actuators was a central topic, emphasizing that these modifications require careful planning and mechanical adaptations.

3. **Community Insights and Knowledge**: There was a sense of community knowledge sharing, with contributors discussing technical aspects like hydraulic vs. electric steering, monitoring feedback, and challenges with vehicle electronics. They shared personal experiences and suggested potential solutions based on their own automotive projects.

4. **Regulatory and Legal Considerations**: Some participants raised questions about the legality of DIY modifications and self-driving technologies in different regions, particularly in Europe. They touched on regulatory aspects that can impact vehicle modifications.

Meta is discontinuing its AI-powered profiles on Facebook and Instagram after a wave of renewed interest led to conversations that exposed flaws in their design. Introduced in September 2023, these profiles, such as “Liv,” a supposed “proud Black queer momma,” were soon criticized for lacking diversity in their development teams. Following a viral discovery of the characters and their troubling responses, including admission of all-white, male creators, Meta swiftly removed all remaining AI accounts to address a bug that prevented users from blocking them. While Meta's AI characters are disappearing, the company still allows users to create their own chatbots, raising questions about accountability and moderation in the evolving landscape of AI interactions.

Meta's recent decision to discontinue its AI-powered profiles on Facebook and Instagram has sparked a diverse discussion among Hacker News users, focusing on broader implications for AI development and accountability in tech. Here are the key points from the conversation:

1. **Reactions to AI Profiles**: Users expressed skepticism about the effectiveness of AI profiles, highlighting their lack of authenticity and the need for more genuine representation in AI development teams. The use of a singular "all-white, male" creator narrative for diverse characters drew significant criticism.

2. **Legal and Ethical Concerns**: Several comments focused on the legal implications of using AI in health and insurance sectors, referencing HIPAA regulations, and the potential risks of AI misrepresentations affecting insurance claims and health records.

3. **Data Privacy Issues**: There were discussions about the protection of personal health information and the complexities arising from machine learning algorithms using such data, raising concerns about compliance and ethical standards in AI applications.

4. **Broader AI Implications**: Users speculated on the future of AI interactions, emphasizing the need for proper moderation and oversight as users are permitted to create custom chatbots, which could potentially lead to misuse or harmful outputs.

5. **Call for Accountability**: The community called for increased accountability from companies like Meta regarding their AI systems, especially given the ethical ramifications emerging from flawed AI character development.

Overall, the discourse illustrates a critical examination of how AI technologies intersect with real-world complexities such as health care, privacy, and cultural representation, demonstrating a collective demand for more responsible AI practices.
