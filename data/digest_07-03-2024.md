### Hypr-dynamic-cursors: a plugin to make your hyprland cursor rotate

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/VirtCode/hypr-dynamic-cursors) | 29 points | by [RGBCube](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RGBCube) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40865559)

Today on Hacker News, a new plugin called "hypr-dynamic-cursors" caught the attention of developers. This plugin aims to make your cursor in Hyprland more realistic by simulating how it would behave as an actual object being dragged across the screen. It introduces features like tilt, rotate, stretch, and even shake to find functionality, inspired by KDE and MacOS.

With different simulation modes available, users can customize their cursor experience based on their preferences. The plugin is in early development stages, and the creator mentions that it was primarily created out of curiosity to explore rotating or tilted cursors. Despite being somewhat of a joke project, the shake to find feature adds a practical aspect to the plugin.

For those interested in trying out this unique cursor plugin, installation is supported through hyprpm for Hyprland versions v0.41.2 and above. Remember that compatibility with other plugins is not guaranteed, but this plugin should work with any cursor theme. If this innovative cursor behavior sounds intriguing to you, consider contributing to its development as the project evolves.

- User "flm" expresses their opinion that the plugin probably breaks brain's ability to predict where the hot pixels are, and finds it unnecessary as pixels nowadays are already small. They mention that MacOS, after shaking their finger on the trackpad, made the cursor big to help find it. They suggest that a similar approach, like flipping and falling circles or turbulence, could visually locate a big, cluttered screen. User "RGBCube" asks for clarification on how the stretch and shake effects work in the plugin.

- User "crt" criticizes the plugin, calling it incredibly stupid and comparing it to switching to Hyprland to catch a kitten chasing a cursor.

- User "gn" thanks and appreciates the heat of the discussion.

- User "azinman2" appreciates the creativity in the rotating mode of the plugin subtly, missing the whimsy that is largely absent in modern computing days. User "brknmchn" agrees, stating that while certain features might not be the greatest, they can make things dynamic and good for bored fingers that loved computerized wobbly windows and the old-school cursor bopping.
