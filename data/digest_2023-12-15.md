#### [Submission URL](https://www.amazon.science/blog/do-large-language-models-really-need-all-those-layers) | 173 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38656039)

Do large language models really need all those layers? That's the question posed in a paper presented at the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference. The researchers found that 70% of attention heads and 20% of feed-forward networks in large language models could be removed with minimal effect on in-context learning, suggesting that these models are undertrained. The study focused on the OPT-66B model, a 66-billion-parameter language model, and found that a significant portion of the model could be discarded without affecting performance. These findings could help in building more powerful language models by identifying architectural elements that need better training.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of large language models (LLMs). Some users highlight the wastefulness of training these models with large amounts of parameters, suggesting that certain architectural elements could be removed without significant impact on performance. Others discuss the trade-offs and techniques for improving the efficiency of LLMs, such as pruning, distillation, sparse transformers, mixture experts, and quantization. 

There is also a debate on the utility and generalizability of LLMs, with some users questioning their performance compared to smaller models and the need to chase state-of-the-art benchmarks. Concerns are raised about the excessive size and computational costs of these models, as well as issues related to convergence and training time. Users also bring up the idea of combining different techniques and specializations in LLMs to enhance performance.

Additionally, there are discussions on the appropriate methods for optimizing LLMs, such as quantization and pruning, and the challenges of compressing these models. The role of scale and context learning in LLMs is explored, and comparisons are made to the human brain's capacity for learning. There is also mention of a related paper about the interpretability of large-scale models and the need for rethinking their role.

Some users question the generalizability of LLMs and the interpretations they provide, highlighting the multiple possible interpretations of sentences and the limitations of syntactical understanding. The differences between training and inference in LLMs are also brought up.

Overall, the discussion delves into the efficiency, performance, and limitations of large language models, providing insights and alternative viewpoints on their architecture, training methods, and practical applications.

### Metasurface antenna to manipulate all fundamental characteristics of EM waves

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-40717-9) | 17 points | by [ortusdux](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ortusdux) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38658931)

Researchers have proposed and demonstrated a universal metasurface antenna (UMA) capable of manipulating all characteristics of electromagnetic waves simultaneously and independently. Metasurfaces have the potential to revolutionize various photonic and electronic devices, but controlling all wave properties has been a challenge. The UMA allows for dynamic, software-defined manipulation of properties such as amplitude, phase, frequency, polarization, and momentum. This opens up possibilities for more complex waveform generation, beamforming, and information manipulation, potentially simplifying the architecture of information transmitter systems. The UMA could have applications in next-generation wireless systems, cognitive sensing, imaging, quantum optics, and quantum information science.

The discussion on the proposed universal metasurface antenna (UMA) highlights the potential applications and implications of this technology. One user mentions previous research on photonic chips that transform light beams with multiple properties and another user shares two related articles on universal visible matter integration and coherent surface plasmon polariton amplification. Another user finds the concept of software-defined manipulation of electromagnetic wave properties interesting, particularly in terms of reducing interference and allowing for station streaming of beams. The discussion then veers into topics such as reversible debatable quantum properties and the Church-Turing-Deutsch complete quantum platform.

Lastly, a user suggests that software-defined lenses could have revolutionary potential in various fields.
