The latest controversy at OpenAI has brought to light aggressive tactics aimed at former employees. Leaked documents revealed that departing employees were pressured to sign restrictive exit documents or risk losing their vested equity in the company, a move that sparked backlash within the organization. CEO Sam Altman issued an apology stating that they had never clawed back vested equity and vowed not to do so in the future. However, further scrutiny of company documents suggested that Altman and other executives were aware of the provisions threatening equity retention. This revelation raised concerns about transparency and trust within OpenAI, a prominent player in the field of artificial intelligence. As the company navigates this controversy, questions linger about its commitment to fostering a culture of open dialogue and accountability among its workforce.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the recent controversy at OpenAI regarding the restrictive exit agreements and the pressure former employees faced to sign these documents to retain vested equity. Users expressed their concerns about the legality and ethical implications of such agreements, especially regarding non-compete clauses. Some users shared their personal experiences with similar contracts and emphasized the importance of understanding the terms before signing. The debate also touched upon the concept of garden leave, the differences between non-compete agreements and garden leave, and the potential consequences for employees and companies involved in such agreements. Additionally, there was a discussion about the taxation of vested equity and the repercussions for employees in these situations.

### Microsoft Paint's new AI image generator builds on your brushstrokes

#### [Submission URL](https://petapixel.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-paints-new-ai-image-generator-builds-on-your-brushstrokes/) | 150 points | by [mikece](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikece) | [181 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40439654)

In a surprising move, Microsoft Paint is pushing the boundaries of its traditional image creation tool by introducing a new artificial intelligence image generator. This innovative feature, part of Microsoftâ€™s Cocreator suite, was recently unveiled at the company's Surface event. While AI image generation is nothing new, Paint's tool stands out by allowing users to input text prompts or even doodles to fine-tune the resulting image. By blending their own strokes with AI-generated content, users can craft unique and personalized artwork in almost real-time.

Microsoft emphasizes the collaborative nature of this tool, stating that as users iterate on their creations, the artwork also evolves, enabling easy refinements and edits. The addition of a "Creativity" slider further enhances user customization, offering a spectrum of artistic influence from literal to expressive. This not only provides a platform for experimentation with AI but also supports users in enhancing their creative skills.

The resurrection of Microsoft Paint from its brief hiatus in 2017 showcases the software's commitment to evolving with the rapid pace of technology. By integrating advanced AI features like background removal and now AI image generation for all users, Microsoft Paint demonstrates its relevance in the ever-changing digital landscape. As AI technology continues to advance, discussions around the legality and ownership of AI-enhanced artwork are likely to surface, highlighting the ethical and legal implications of this creative intersection.

Microsoft Paint's bold step into the realm of AI image generation signifies a new chapter in digital art creation, opening up exciting possibilities for both seasoned artists and aspiring creatives to explore and expand their skills in collaboration with artificial intelligence.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about Microsoft Paint's new AI image generation feature covers various topics. Users shared experiences with graphic tablets like Huion and software like Krita, emphasizing its amazing integration and open-source nature. There were technical discussions about GPUs, processors, AI integrations, and AI models generating original content. Some users expressed skepticism or concern about the quality of AI-generated art compared to traditional methods. Additionally, there were humorous references to April 1st jokes, nostalgic mentions of Microsoft Paint's history, and speculations about AI's role in various applications like coding assistance and internet interactions. Overall, the comments reflect a mix of excitement, skepticism, technical insights, and light-hearted banter regarding the intersection of AI and creativity in digital art.

### A Grand Unified Theory of the AI Hype Cycle

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.glyph.im/2024/05/grand-unified-ai-hype.html) | 25 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40443612)

The history of AI is a rollercoaster ride of hype and disillusionment, a cycle that seems to repeat itself with each new innovation. Scientists develop a novel mechanism, labeled as N, which requires significant computing resources and holds great promise. Funding pours in, leading to immediate results and revolutionary possibilities for machine cognition. The term "Artificial Intelligence" gets thrown around liberally, encompassing a wide range of technologies.

However, as time passes, overblown claims give way to skepticism, and the limitations of N become apparent. Competent practitioners quietly distance themselves from the AI label, and users start using more specific terms. Eventually, as computing power advances and products are released to underwhelming reception, investors lose interest, leading to a pivot away from AI towards other fields.

This pattern has repeated with previous technologies like neural networks in the 1950s and deep learning in the 2010s. Each cycle produces valuable technology but ultimately follows a predictable curve of rapid progress, followed by gradual improvement, and then a plateau. The AI hype cycle continues, with each new innovation becoming the next big thing before fading into the background as a more precise mechanism emerges.

The discussion on the submission delves into the current state of AI progress and the hype surrounding it. Here are the key points from the comments:

1. **krrs** suggests that AI might be causing more harm than good by bringing a cycle of destruction longer than expected. They express concerns about AI potentially giving certain individuals direct access to powerful tools with limitations that cannot be easily solved.

2. **mrtndbp** expresses confusion about the current state of AI progress, comparing it to expert systems. They emphasize the importance of logical reasoning and principles in AI development, suggesting that AI advancements may not be as significant as hyped.

3. **dmvdg** engages in a debate about the mismatch between expert systems and hype in AI. They discuss the hype cycle in the AI field and point out the overstatements made by evangelists and marketers over the years. They emphasize the decline of hype over time.

4. **mrtndbp** argues against the validation of hype in technology, implying that hype does not dictate the actual technological advancements. They counter arguments about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) claiming it might be overestimated similar to historical events like the invention of the nuclear bomb. They speculate about missing components for AGI similar to scaling laws in nuclear reactions.

5. **cntvnblzc** humorously mentions a link to the Theranos scandal in response to the discussions about overhyped technology.

6. **DerCommodore** flags the submission, possibly indicating some issue or violation.

Overall, the comments touch on skepticism towards the current state of AI progress, debate on the impact of hype, and humorous references to past technological scandals like Theranos.
