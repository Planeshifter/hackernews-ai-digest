### Clean, a formal verification DSL for ZK circuits in Lean4

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.zksecurity.xyz/posts/clean/) | 70 points | by [vons](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vons) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43496577)

In the ever-evolving field of cryptography, zero-knowledge (ZK) circuits hold tremendous potential but are often plagued with bugs. To address these challenges, a team has embarked on a groundbreaking project, introducing an embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and formal verification framework for ZK circuits within Lean4. This ambitious endeavor is part of the broader zkEVM Formal Verification Project, aiming to develop reliable infrastructure and tools to confidently verify zkEVMs.

Their initiative, dubbed "Clean," is focused on defining ZK circuits, specifying their desired properties, and most crucially, formally proving their correctness. By integrating these elements into Lean4, they plan to create a library of robust, reusable, and formally verified circuit gadgets. Currently targeting the AIR arithmetization, the framework assumes a table lookup primitive within the underlying proof system, setting the stage for accurate formal reasoning about ZK circuits.

The project zeroes in on two pivotal properties in formal verification: soundness and completeness. Soundness ensures that any witness satisfying the constraints inherently upholds a specific property, preventing underconstrained circuits. Completeness guarantees that for every valid input, a witness can be found to satisfy the constraints, avoiding overconstrained circuits.

By supporting basic operations such as witness introduction, assertion of constraints, lookup relations, and subcircuit integration, the framework aims to make circuit definition intuitive and syntactically natural. A monadic interface further enhances usability, allowing developers to write and compose ZK circuits seamlessly.

The formal verification framework's backbone is the "FormalCircuit" structure, which encapsulates the circuit's core operations, assumptions, specifications, and the necessary proofs for soundness and completeness. This structured approach ensures a rigorous verification process, fortifying the reliability of ZK circuits against potential errors.

For those curious to dive deeper into these novel developments, a presentation featured in the zkEVM project updates call offers additional insights. As the project evolves, it promises to be a transformative leap towards securely leveraging zero-knowledge proofs in complex cryptographic systems.

The discussion revolves around clarifying terminology related to the submission about the **Clean project** (a DSL for zero-knowledge circuits in the zkEVM ecosystem). Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Confusion about "EOF" and "EVM":**  
   - A user asks what **EOF** and **EVM** stand for.  
   - Another user explains:  
     - **EOF** refers to the **Ethereum Object Format**, a new bytecode format for the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](https://vmbjctfrmtrg)).  
     - **Clean** is the domain-specific language (DSL) for writing zero-knowledge proof circuits, which is part of the broader zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) project.  

2. **Abbreviation Challenges:**  
   - The conversation highlights initial confusion due to heavy use of abbreviations (e.g., "EOF," "EVM," "DSL"), but the key terms are resolved through clarification.  

3. **Connection to the Submission:**  
   - The Clean project’s focus on formal verification of ZK circuits is indirectly tied to EVM via zkEVM, which aims to bring zero-knowledge proofs to Ethereum’s execution layer.  

In summary, the discussion clarifies that **EOF** is an Ethereum-related bytecode format, while **Clean** is a tool for building formally verified ZK circuits within the zkEVM ecosystem.

### Parameter-free KV cache compression for memory-efficient long-context LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10714) | 65 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43496244)

A fascinating advancement in the realm of long-context language models was unveiled in a paper titled "ZeroMerge: Parameter-Free KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient Long-Context LLMs," by Xin Liu and colleagues. The research tackles the pressing issue of key-value (KV) cache memory growth and computational complexity, which restrict efficiency in large language models (LLMs). Traditional KV cache optimization methods have their downsides, often leading to information loss or necessitating costly retraining processes. However, ZeroMerge introduces a novel, dynamic zero-shot compression framework that innovatively manages cache memory without relying on parameter retraining.

The method stands out with its three pivotal innovations: using multi-dimensional token importance metrics for fine-grained memory allocation, preserving critical context through a unique residual merging mechanism, and offering a parameter-free adaptation compatible across various LLM architectures. Impressively, ZeroMerge has been tested on the LLaMA-2 model and demonstrates maintaining performance at astonishingly low 5% compression ratios while doubling inference throughput for 40,000-token lengths. This positions ZeroMerge as a powerful solution, effectively balancing memory efficiency, generation quality, and deployment flexibility, crucial for the evolving field of practical long-context LLM applications. For those interested, the authors have made their code available online.
