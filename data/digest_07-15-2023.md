### Ada Outperforms Assembly: A Case Study

#### [Submission URL](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~adagroup/sigada-website/lawlis.html) | 54 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36741990)

In a case study from 1992, a defense contractor attempted to prove that Ada programming language could not produce real-time code by writing a portion of their software in Ada. The expectation was that the resulting machine code would be too large and too slow for a communications application. However, the opposite was found to be true. The compiled Ada code was smaller and executed at approximately the same speed, if not faster, than the corresponding assembly code. This challenged the belief that assembly language was the only appropriate language for certain applications. The contractor had initially disregarded the use of Ada, despite it being required by the Department of Defense for mission critical computer resources. Despite the results of this case study, the use of Ada over assembly language was still a topic of debate in the industry at the time.

The discussion in the comments revolves around various aspects of the Ada programming language and its usage in different industries. Some comments point out that modern CPUs and instruction scheduling techniques have made assembly language less necessary, while others argue that certain industries still rely on Ada for safety-critical systems. There are also mentions of other programming languages and their suitability for different applications. Some comments discuss personal experiences with Ada, including its use in defense contractors and aerospace systems. The discussion also touches on topics such as version control systems, job opportunities for Ada programmers, and the perception of ROI (return on investment) for different programming languages.
