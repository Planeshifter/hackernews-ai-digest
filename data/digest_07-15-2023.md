### Ada Outperforms Assembly: A Case Study

#### [Submission URL](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~adagroup/sigada-website/lawlis.html) | 54 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36741990)

In a case study from 1992, a defense contractor attempted to prove that Ada programming language could not produce real-time code by writing a portion of their software in Ada. The expectation was that the resulting machine code would be too large and too slow for a communications application. However, the opposite was found to be true. The compiled Ada code was smaller and executed at approximately the same speed, if not faster, than the corresponding assembly code. This challenged the belief that assembly language was the only appropriate language for certain applications. The contractor had initially disregarded the use of Ada, despite it being required by the Department of Defense for mission critical computer resources. Despite the results of this case study, the use of Ada over assembly language was still a topic of debate in the industry at the time.

The discussion in the comments revolves around various aspects of the Ada programming language and its usage in different industries. Some comments point out that modern CPUs and instruction scheduling techniques have made assembly language less necessary, while others argue that certain industries still rely on Ada for safety-critical systems. There are also mentions of other programming languages and their suitability for different applications. Some comments discuss personal experiences with Ada, including its use in defense contractors and aerospace systems. The discussion also touches on topics such as version control systems, job opportunities for Ada programmers, and the perception of ROI (return on investment) for different programming languages.

Title: Brave Allows Ingestion of Copyrighted Data for AI Training through Brave Search API

Summary:
Brave, a privacy-focused browser, offers an API product called Data for AI, which allows users to feed AI models for inference and train them with data. However, there is a concern with copyright infringement as Brave's Data for AI API lets users ingest copyrighted material without explicit permission. The API even grants "rights" to this data, including storage rights. A comparison with Google's featured snippets shows that Brave's "extra snippets" can be quite extensive, ranging from 150 to 260 words. While search engines like Google often fall within fair use guidelines due to limited snippet lengths, Brave's usage seems to surpass fair use boundaries. It's worth noting that Brave's API response attributes the domain name but fails to follow the license requirements of the copyrighted content. Brave has clarified that they are compliant on their end, but the responsibility of attribution lies with third parties who use the data for AI models.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of Brave's API and the concerns surrounding copyright infringement. Some users argue that Brave's ingestion of copyrighted material for AI training goes against copyright laws and fair use guidelines. Others discuss the complexity of copyright regulations and how AI models are trained with transformed data. 

There are also discussions about Brave's data collection practices and privacy features. Some users express concerns about the information Brave collects and how it is used, while others argue that Brave offers opt-in features and respects user privacy.

Additional topics include comparisons between Brave and other browsers, discussions about the business model and cryptocurrency (BAT) used by Brave, and opinions on the trustworthiness of different browsers.

Overall, the discussion highlights a range of viewpoints on the copyright issues surrounding Brave's API and its privacy-focused approach to browsing.

### History of T (2001)

#### [Submission URL](http://www.paulgraham.com/thist.html) | 69 points | by [swatson741](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=swatson741) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36732335)

In the early 1980s, a new Lisp implementation called T was developed at Yale's computer science department. T was created by undergraduate Jonathan Rees, along with Olin Shivers and Daniel Weld, who were also students at Yale at the time. 

At the time, there was a lack of established Lisp implementations, with Common Lisp and MIT Scheme still in their infancy. The concept of lexical scope, which is now widely used, was not considered efficient back then. Even experts in Lisp implementation believed that dynamic scope was the faster choice. Additionally, languages with garbage collection were not widely accepted or used.

T was developed during a time when 32-bit machines with large address spaces were becoming more prevalent. Existing language technology in the AI community was designed for smaller machines like the PDP-11. The PDP-10, which was a 36-bit machine, was considered by many to be the world's first Lisp machine. However, the limited 18-bit address space of the PDP-10 was a hindrance for programmers.

With the advent of machines like the Vax and Motorola 68000s with 32-bit address spaces, language implementation needed to evolve. Tackling this challenge, Berkeley developed Franz Lisp for the Vax, Mark of the Unicorn created Interlisp, and MIT initiated the NIL project. T was heavily influenced by these Lisp implementations, as well as a little-known Lisp done at Harvard.

Unfortunately, the NIL project, while promising, suffered from premature optimization and never got delivered in a meaningful way. T, however, became one of the best Lisp implementations of its time, setting a standard for clean design that few newer dialects have been able to meet.

The discussion around this submission includes several comments providing additional resources and history related to T and Lisp implementation. 

One commenter shares a link to a related discussion from 2001 and another commenter shares previous discussions about T in 2018, 2015, 2013, and 2012.

Another commenter points out that the concept of lexical scope was not considered efficient at the time when T was developed, and that dynamic scope was believed to be faster. However, this approach changed in the early 1990s when lexical scope became more popular.

There is also a discussion about the differences between lexical and dynamic scoping, with some commenters explaining the advantages of lexical scoping and the use of closures in Lisp.

Some commenters discuss the challenges and optimizations involved in compiling Lisp programs and the trade-offs between dynamic and lexical scoping.

Overall, there is appreciation for the history and development of Lisp and T, with commenters sharing their personal experiences and interest in Lisp programming.
