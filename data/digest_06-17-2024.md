### NumPy-style broadcasting in Futhark

#### [Submission URL](https://futhark-lang.org/blog/2024-06-17-automap.html) | 113 points | by [zfnmxt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zfnmxt) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40704179)

In a recent blog post by Robert Schenck, a PhD student at DIKU, he introduced AUTOMAP, a new feature in the Futhark programming language that enables NumPy-style broadcasting. This feature aims to simplify mathematical code involving higher-dimensional arguments by allowing for more natural and concise expression of operations on arrays.

By implementing AUTOMAP, Futhark users will be able to write code that resembles manual mathematical notation, such as directly adding two vectors [1,2,3] and [4,5,6] as [1,2,3] + [4,5,6] instead of using explicit maps like map2 (+) [1,2,3] [4,5,6]. This not only streamlines the syntax but also enhances code readability and reduces unnecessary complexity.

The AUTOMAP feature extends beyond simple scalar operations to handle different rank combinations, such as subtracting matrices from each other or adding vectors to matrices. By automatically inferring the necessary maps and replicates to align argument dimensions correctly, Futhark can now support rank polymorphism, enabling functions to be applied to arguments of varying ranks seamlessly.

This advancement in Futhark demonstrates a commitment to enhancing the user experience and fostering more intuitive and expressive programming practices in the realm of high-performance purely functional data-parallel array programming.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about the AUTOMAP feature in the Futhark programming language covers various aspects. 

One commenter suggests not using NumPy's broadcasting in certain contexts, highlighting Julia's behavior as a great example. The discussion then delves into how Futhark synergetically implements a similar syntax for broadcasting with nuances on type inference and rank differences compared to Julia.

Some users discuss the similarities and differences between Futhark and Julia in terms of syntactic sugar, broadcast semantics, type systems, and runtime information handling. They also explore the distinction in broadcasting expressions between Futhark and Julia, emphasizing the static type system of Futhark.

One user emphasizes the importance of taking a page from Julia's book in specifying function applications based on element-wise operations for arrays. Another user points out the potential for ambiguity in statically typed languages like Futhark.

In a slightly off-topic comment, a user mentions their interest in programming languages and humorously compares Futhark to languages like INTERCAL and Malbolge.

Another user congratulates the developers on the graduation and optimization work related to broadcast portions for GPUs, hinting at exciting developments with high-throughput array processing challenges in Futhark.

A commenter expresses confusion about matrix representations as arrays of arrays and receives explanations about the rectangular nature of Futhark's arrays and verified statically for consistency.

Lastly, the discussion veers towards the uniqueness of Futhark's array semantics, focusing on rectangular arrays, their representation, and the language's limitations compared to more generalized array languages like APL.
