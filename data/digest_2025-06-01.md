In an exciting announcement from OpenAI, they're taking the Codex CLI up a notch by transitioning it to a native Rust implementation. This shift is part of their efforts to refine the tool's cross-platform stability, security, performance, and extensibility. The original Codex CLI, initially developed using Node.js and React-based Ink, provided a quick and interactive terminal UI. However, to optimize performance and offer a zero-dependency install, the team is now leveraging Rust's strengths.

Why Rust? Well, it's about picking the right tool for the job. Rust eliminates the need for runtime garbage collection, thereby reducing memory consumption. It also brings native security bindings for Linux sandboxing to the table—an intriguing feature that’s already partly in place thanks to available Rust bindings.

OpenAI is not just stopping at a Rust makeover. They’re enhancing Codex with a wire protocol to allow developers to extend its functionalities across different languages, including TypeScript, Python, and more. This makes Codex not just a robust tool but a versatile one.

While the team continues squashing bugs in the TypeScript version, they're hard at work aligning the Rust implementation with the current features. Contributions from the developer community have been key to this transition, and OpenAI is calling for more enthusiasts to join their journey. If you're someone who thrives on Rust development and agentic coding, this could be your chance to jump into a dynamic project.

OpenAI expresses gratitude to all contributors for their input so far, and they’re reaching out for more hands on deck as they pave the way to make the Rust-based Codex CLI the default experience. Want to be part of this innovative shift? The Codex team is open to fresh ideas and talents at codex-maintainers@openai.com.

### Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek/) | 318 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [211 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44149238)

DeepSeek-V3 is reportedly both fast and cheap when served at scale, yet it remains cumbersome and costly for local runs. This paradox is a common theme in the world of AI models, where a fundamental tradeoff exists between throughput and latency. Essentially, models like DeepSeek-V3 are configured such that they excel when handling numerous requests simultaneously but slow down significantly for isolated ones.

The crux of this tradeoff lies in how AI service providers choose to batch requests. Rather than process each user request individually, many systems batch dozens or even thousands of requests together. This batch processing takes advantage of the capabilities of GPUs, which are incredibly efficient at handling large matrix multiplications in one go. Processing a batch of requests can be nearly as fast as fulfilling just one due to GPU optimization, which can handle a substantial matrix multiplication task in one swift motion, avoiding the overhead of issuing multiple commands and swapping data in and out of memory.

This batching allows for remarkable throughput—essentially, the model can churn through more data in less time. However, it also introduces a delay for each user request while it waits for a batch to fill, increasing latency. This is why some models, particularly those based on transformers like DeepSeek-V3, may seem slow when kicked off but accelerate significantly once processes are running in parallel.

An illustrative facet of this is the use of "collection windows" by AI servers, which aggregate requests over a brief timeframe before processing them together. The window size can vary—ranging from 5 milliseconds to possibly 200 milliseconds—depending on the desired balance of throughput and latency. Short windows lead to quicker responses for individuals but potentially underutilize GPU capacity. In contrast, longer windows maximize utilization by collecting more requests, thus ensuring that the heavy-duty matrix multiplications are as large and efficient as possible.

For specific models, like mixture-of-experts architectures, this batching is not just an optimization but a necessity. These models consist of myriad smaller computations that, if processed piecemeal, would severely underutilize GPU capabilities. By collecting larger batches, the system ensures that each "expert" involved has enough data to process efficiently, reducing the number of small, inefficient computations.

In summary, DeepSeek-V3 and similar models are designed to leverage the innate strengths of GPUs to achieve high throughput at the expense of latency for individual requests. This makes them ideal for large scale deployments but less suited for localized, single-instance tasks.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and trade-offs of running large AI models like DeepSeek-V3 locally, with a focus on hardware setups, quantization methods, performance benchmarks, and cost debates.

### Key Points:
1. **Local Hardware Configurations**:  
   - Users shared setups using high-end server-grade hardware (e.g., EPYC 9004 CPUs, 384GB RAM) to run DeepSeek-V3 locally. However, even with such powerful systems, limitations like GPU power draw, RAM constraints, and latency issues persist.  
   - Some achieved modest speeds (~7 tokens/sec with 16k context) using quantization techniques like **Unsloth’s Dynamic GGUF**, though performance varied significantly with context length and model size.  

2. **Quantization and Optimization**:  
   - **Unsloth’s Dynamic GGUF** was highlighted for improving inference efficiency, with claims of near-FP8 precision and compatibility with CPU offloading for memory-heavy tasks. Benchmarks showed accuracy improvements (+1% to +10%) for models like Llama and Gemma after quantization.  
   - Debate arose over real-world performance versus theoretical benchmarks, with some users noting minimal perceptible quality differences between quantized and full models for tasks like summarization or coding.

3. **Performance vs. Cost**:  
   - A $4,000 local setup was criticized as expensive despite the article’s emphasis on affordability, sparking discussions about the practicality of CPU-only inference versus GPU-accelerated solutions.  
   - Comparisons were drawn to cloud providers, where users noted slower speeds (5-10x) but lower upfront costs, though latency for large-context tasks (e.g., 32k tokens) remained a pain point.  

4. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **KV caching** and prompt processing bottlenecks were discussed, with quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms causing delays for long contexts. Some users suggested optimizations like splitting prompts or using memory-efficient frameworks.  
   - Skepticism emerged around CPU-only setups, with arguments that GPUs (e.g., RTX 4090, H100) are essential for interactive use, as even high-end server CPUs struggle with real-time responsiveness.  

5. **Divergent Opinions**:  
   - Enthusiasts praised local deployment for control and privacy, while others deemed it impractical for most users, advocating instead for cloud-based solutions or smaller models (e.g., Gemma 27B) as a balance between performance and resource use.  

### Conclusion:  
The thread underscores the tension between scalability and accessibility in AI deployment. While advancements in quantization and hardware enable local runs of models like DeepSeek-V3, significant trade-offs in cost, speed, and usability persist, reinforcing the divide between large-scale efficiency and individual practicality.

---

### **Key Discussion Points**

#### **Benchmark Validity and Scalability**
- **Controversial Comparisons**: Users questioned the fairness of comparing RenderFormer (76ms on an A100 GPU) to Blender Cycles (397s), noting that Cycles used a much higher sample count (4096 samples/pixel vs. RenderFormer’s 512x512 training). Critics argued this misrepresents real-world performance and fails to account for Blender’s scene-instantiation overhead.
- **Scalability Concerns**: RenderFormer’s quadratic scaling with triangles/pixels was flagged as a limitation. While promising for small scenes (e.g., 4096 triangles), it may struggle with complex scenes (millions of triangles) where traditional path tracers (with linear scaling) excel.

#### **Hardware Relevance**
- **A100 vs. Consumer GPUs**: Skepticism arose about using enterprise-level A100 GPUs for comparison. Participants highlighted that consumer-grade RTX cards (e.g., RTX 4090) with dedicated ray-tracing cores are more relevant for designers but were absent in benchmarks.

#### **Technical Trade-offs**
- **Denoising and Artifacts**: Users observed RenderFormer’s output had AI-typical smoothness, raising concerns about lost texture detail. Traditional denoisers (e.g., in Blender) were seen as more mature for handling noise at low sample counts.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: While RenderFormer avoids ray tracing, its transformer-based approach might not surpass the asymptotic efficiency of path tracing, especially for high-frequency details like complex shadows or reflections.

#### **Use-Case Practicality**
- **Preview vs. Final Renders**: Many saw RenderFormer as a tool for rapid previews (e.g., 3D design drafts) rather than final frames. Its speed could benefit iterative workflows but not replace high-quality, sample-intensive renders for production.
- **Industry Adoption**: Comments noted RenderFormer is a research milestone, but industry adoption would require solving scalability and integration with existing pipelines. Traditional renderers still dominate VFX/film due to precision and robustness.

#### **Miscellaneous**
- **SIGGRAPH Hype?**: Some users linked the paper’s framing to academic conference trends, cautioning against overhyping early-stage techniques.
- **Request for Clarification**: Calls for transparent benchmarks (sample counts, hardware, scene complexity) to better contextualize results.

---

### **TL;DR**
The Hacker News community expressed cautious optimism about RenderFormer’s novel approach but critiqued its benchmarks as misleading, questioned scalability for complex scenes, and highlighted the impracticality of A100-based comparisons. While seen as a leap forward for rapid prototyping, it’s not yet a replacement for established renderers like Blender Cycles in high-quality or industrial contexts.
