Intel is reshaping its chip architecture with the introduction of the Skymont E-Core, designed to boost multithreaded performance and handle low-priority tasks efficiently. This move comes as the company seeks to strengthen its position in the competitive laptop market.

The new Skymont cores integrate aspects of the previous Crestmont design but with significant enhancements. By combining two levels of E-Cores from the prior Meteor Lake design into a single, optimized quad-core configuration, Intel aims to improve power efficiency and overall performance. Each Skymont core operates on a low power island, enabling it to manage background tasks without activating the higher performance P-Cores.

Notably, Skymont's architecture features an eight-wide out-of-order design, showcasing improvements that allow it to compete with the latest from AMD, even if it doesn’t match top clock speeds or absolute performance levels. Intel has focused on refining branch prediction capabilities, which are crucial for minimizing delays and power wastage. Skymont offers enhanced storage for branch history compared to its predecessor, achieving a notable improvement in accuracy and efficiency.

Overall, Skymont represents Intel’s aggressive strategy to reclaim its laptop market dominance, delivering a sophisticated solution to meet the demands of modern computing. As Intel continues to innovate, Skymont paves the way for a new generation of power-efficient, high-performance processors.

The discussion surrounding Intel's new Skymont E-Core centers on its design and performance implications compared to previous architectures and competitors, particularly AMD's Zen 5. 

1. **Architecture Insights**: The Skymont architecture incorporates a more robust branch prediction and execution mechanism, enhancing its efficiency in processing multithreaded workloads. Commenters noted that the Skymont features three-level decoders and improved latency handling, which are significant advancements for Intel.

2. **Performance Comparisons**: There is a consensus among users that while Skymont shows promise, its performance may not match AMD's Zen 5, especially under certain workloads. Some users expressed skepticism regarding how Skymont would perform in real-world applications, particularly in power-limited scenarios.

3. **Efficiency vs. Raw Power**: Several commenters highlighted that Skymont's design emphasizes power efficiency by using E-Cores for low-priority tasks without activating P-Cores, thus potentially reducing heat and energy consumption. However, comparisons suggest that it might still struggle against AMD's more aggressive multithreading.

4. **Future Applications**: There is excitement about the potential applications of Skymont in mobile devices and servers, with discussions on how it may stack up against ARM architectures such as Cortex-X4.

5. **Skepticism and Projections**: Some users remain cautious, predicting that while Skymont could outperform prior Intel designs, matching or exceeding the benchmarks set by AMD’s Zen 5 might be a tall order until further iterations or optimizations are released.

Overall, the conversation reflects a mix of optimism about Skymont's advancements in efficiency and multithreaded performance, tempered by skepticism about its ability to compete directly with rival architectures in raw performance metrics.

In a recent post on Hacker News, a developer shared their frustration with Amazon's AI crawler wreaking havoc on their Gitea git server. Despite efforts to shield their server from relentless bot traffic—including configuring their NGINX ingress and even setting up a VPN—the developer is still experiencing a flood of requests, often coming from various IP addresses and not always appearing as AmazonBot. 

Feeling overwhelmed, they have resorted to creating a proof-of-work reverse proxy to safeguard their server while calling on Amazon to take action and exclude their domain from the crawler's reach. In a heartfelt plea, the developer expressed a desire to maintain public access to their Gitea server but is on the verge of restricting access due to the incessant load. 

With the situation evolving, they plan to document their workaround, titled "Anubis," which aims to provide a more robust defense against such automated requests. As the developer navigates this challenging landscape, their post stands as a cautionary tale for others facing similar challenges with intrusive web crawlers.

In a recent discussion on Hacker News, a developer shared their ongoing battle with Amazon's AI web crawler, which has been bombarding their Gitea git server with excessive requests. Despite implementing protective measures like configuring NGINX and establishing a VPN, the developer continues to be overwhelmed by traffic, prompting them to consider a proof-of-work reverse proxy solution named "Anubis." 

The conversation among commenters unveiled various perspectives on the issue. Some users pointed out that web crawlers like AmazonBot often disregard the "robots.txt" file's directives due to misconfigured user-agent strings, suggesting that companies should reinforce compliance with these protocols. Several comments highlighted the legal implications under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, with some suggesting the developer consult legal counsel regarding their rights against unauthorized access by bots.

Others discussed technical solutions to mitigate crawler impact, including blocking IP ranges and implementing rate limiting strategies. Suggestions for AI-driven filtering models were also mentioned, reflecting a growing frustration with the inadequacies of current web crawling practices.

### O1 isn't a chat model (and that's the point)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.latent.space/p/o1-skill-issue) | 152 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [131 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42750096)

In a recent exploration of the OpenAI model o1, writer Ben Hylak shares his transformation from skeptic to daily user, debunking the notion that o1 is simply another chat model. His journey began with frustration—initially seeing o1 as an underwhelming tool which produced convoluted, self-contradictory answers. However, through dialogue with other users and a deeper understanding of the model's capabilities, he discovered the key to leveraging o1 effectively lies not in treating it like a chatbot, but rather as a "report generator."

Hylak emphasizes the importance of context in using o1 successfully, arguing that users should not only frame questions but provide comprehensive briefs packed with relevant details. This approach demands a thorough explanation of the problem at hand, akin to onboarding a new team member. The article serves as a "Missing Manual," offering insights on how to prompt o1 by giving it the necessary context and clear objectives upfront. As Hylak highlights, to unlock the real power of o1, users must experiment with conveying their needs more precisely and thoughtfully.

In a recent discussion about the OpenAI model o1, users shared varied insights regarding its practical applications and effectiveness. One user, geor9e, expressed skepticism, suggesting that the focus should shift from learning the latest workflows to understanding AI's potential, especially in a relatively underwhelming context for newcomers. 

Several commenters echoed concerns about the limitations of the o1 model, mentioning that while it can generate detailed reports, its context sensitivity is crucial for effective usage. For instance, gwrn pointed out how users must redefine their prompts to better fit the model's capabilities to avoid convoluted and inconsistent answers. 

Others, like pzz, analyzed the model's training processes, noting that improper prompting can result in suboptimal outputs, attributing this to the model’s reliance on maximum likelihood training principles. 

The conversation also touched on the integration of generative AI in educational contexts, with some commenters advocating for courses that leverage AI tools like Stable Diffusion, suggesting that teaching students to experiment with innovative technologies can bolster creativity and practical skill sets. 

Despite recognition of the potential pitfalls, participants highlighted a growing fascination with AI’s role in creativity and design, noting that successful engagement with models like o1 requires a blend of clear prompting, detailed context, and an understanding that the technology is still evolving. 

Overall, the discussion reflects a mixture of skepticism and enthusiasm towards AI capabilities in real-world applications, urging users to adapt their approaches to maximize the potential of tools like o1.
