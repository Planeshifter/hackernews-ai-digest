Title: Wifedom: Mrs Orwell‚Äôs Invisible Life by Anna Funder - A Critical Review

Anna Funder's "Wifedom: Mrs Orwell‚Äôs Invisible Life" delves into the intricacies of Eileen O‚ÄôShaughnessy's marriage to George Orwell, shedding light on the unequal dynamics within the relationship. Funder portrays Orwell as exploitative, neglectful, and hypocritical, while highlighting Eileen's selfless contributions and sacrifices to support Orwell's literary endeavors. The book challenges the conventional narrative of Orwell's saintly image and aims to rectify the historical oversight of Eileen's pivotal role in his life.

Funder's narrative weaves between biographical accounts and fictionalized vignettes, painting a complex portrait of the Orwell/Eileen dynamic. However, the book has sparked controversy by potentially tarnishing Orwell's reputation and raising questions about the ethics of critiquing historical figures. Funder navigates this delicate balance by emphasizing the separation of art from the artist and urging readers to appreciate Orwell's work while acknowledging his personal shortcomings.

Despite Funder's intention to rectify the imbalance in recognizing Eileen's contributions, some critics argue that the book's focus on Orwell's flaws overshadows its initial purpose. The examination of Orwell's character through a critical lens risks overshadowing Eileen's narrative, turning "Wifedom" into a reflection of Orwell rather than a celebration of Eileen's agency.

In conclusion, "Wifedom: Mrs Orwell‚Äôs Invisible Life" offers a thought-provoking reinterpretation of George Orwell's personal life and the unrecognized role of his wife, Eileen O‚ÄôShaughnessy. Funder challenges readers to reconsider Orwell's legacy through a more nuanced lens, highlighting the complexities of artistic genius and the sacrifices often made by those behind the scenes.

The discussion on the submission "Wifedom: Mrs Orwell‚Äôs Invisible Life" revolves around the portrayal of George Orwell's character and the impact on Eileen O‚ÄôShaughnessy's narrative. While some commenters critique Orwell's flaws and the implications on his work, others argue for a balanced view of Orwell's contributions. The conversation also touches on related topics such as socialism, political ideologies, linguistic manipulation as seen in Orwell's works, and historical events like the Spanish Civil War. Additionally, there are references to other literary works and figures that intersect with Orwell's legacy. The debate underscores a nuanced view of Orwell's legacy and its implications on how we understand history, literature, and societal change.

### Meta says European data is essential for culturally relevant AI

#### [Submission URL](https://stackdiary.com/meta-says-european-data-is-essential-for-culturally-relevant-ai/) | 25 points | by [skilled](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=skilled) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40643499)

Meta's latest move to use European data for AI training has raised eyebrows and concerns about privacy and consent. While Meta claims it aims to create culturally relevant AI for Europeans, the approach of automatically enrolling users without explicit consent is troubling. The complex opt-out process highlighted by Meta seems cumbersome and raises questions about how many users will actually go through the steps to protect their data.

The company's reliance on the "Legitimate Interests" clause under GDPR to process public data for AI training has sparked debate about the balance between corporate interests and individual rights. Critics argue that using publicly available data for corporate gain without explicit consent may amount to data exploitation.

Meta's push for AI innovation in Europe while navigating privacy laws underscores the need for transparent and responsible data practices. Users should have clear options to understand and control how their data is used. The company's insistence that stricter privacy measures could hinder European access to cutting-edge AI technology has sparked a larger debate about the intersection of data privacy and technological progress.

As Meta positions AI as the next frontier of technology with limitless possibilities, the discussion around data privacy, consent, and user empowerment takes center stage in shaping the future of AI development in Europe.

The top story on Hacker News today is about karpathy's nanoGPT repository, which aims to be the simplest and fastest way to train or fine-tune medium-sized GPTs. This project is a rewrite of minGPT with a focus on practical use cases over educational purposes. The code is straightforward and easy to understand, with a training loop in `train.py` and a GPT model definition in `model.py`. It can replicate training a GPT-2 model on OpenWebText in about 4 days on a single 8XA100 40GB node. If you're keen to experiment, dependencies like Pytorch, numpy, transformers, datasets, tiktoken, wandb, and tqdm are required. Users can quickly start training a character-level GPT on Shakespeare's works or fine-tune pretrained models for different tasks. Whether you have a high-performance GPU or a simple CPU setup, nanoGPT offers an accessible entry point into the world of GPT models.

### IMF stark warning on AI's potential to turn downturn into economic crisis

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2024/06/09/ai-risks-recession-economic-crisis-job-losses-financial-markets-supply-chains-imf/) | 17 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40645571)

In a recent speech at an AI summit in Switzerland, Gita Gopinath, the first deputy managing director of the IMF, delivered a stark warning about the potential economic crisis that artificial intelligence (AI) could trigger during a downturn. She highlighted the risks of AI impacting labor markets, financial markets, and supply chains, potentially amplifying the effects of a recession.

Gopinath emphasized that in a world where AI is widely adopted, companies may prioritize automation over retaining workers during economic downturns, leading to increased job losses. Additionally, the financial industry's rapid adoption of AI in areas like algorithmic trading and robo-advisors could pose risks during market downturns, as AI models may struggle to adapt to novel events.

To address these risks, Gopinath proposed measures such as ensuring tax policies do not favor automation over workers, investing in worker education and skills training, and leveraging AI for upskilling and early warning systems in financial markets. She stressed the need for a concerted effort to "AI-proof" the global economy to mitigate the potential negative impacts of AI in future economic crises.

hspkn shared an archived link related to the discussion. 
ProllyInfamous made a playful comment about renaming Special Drawing Rights on Wikipedia to "Individual Citizen stock gold or stashes or land." 
Bluestein reflected on the IMF's warning and suggested the idea of an AI-proof economy being equivalent to an IMF-proof economy, implying skepticism towards achieving such a grand goal.
