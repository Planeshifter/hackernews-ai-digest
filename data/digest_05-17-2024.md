In a shocking turn of events, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company that brought us ChatGPT, is now making headlines for all the wrong reasons. While touting the release of ChatGPT 4o with its human-like conversational abilities, the company is also facing a major internal crisis. The resignations of key figures like co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, along with his team leader Jan Leike, have sparked intense speculation and controversy.

The departure of these high-profile employees from OpenAI's superalignment team has raised concerns about the company's direction and culture. The lack of transparency surrounding their resignations has only fueled rumors and theories about what might be happening behind closed doors at OpenAI.

One particularly troubling detail that has emerged is the strict off-boarding agreement that former employees are required to sign, which includes nondisclosure and non-disparagement clauses. This agreement effectively silences departing employees, preventing them from speaking out against the company or even acknowledging the existence of the NDA. Failure to comply with these terms can result in the loss of millions of dollars in vested equity, a severe consequence that acts as a powerful deterrent against speaking out.

As OpenAI struggles to address the fallout from the resignations and the backlash over its restrictive policies, questions continue to swirl about the company's commitment to transparency and accountability. The once-celebrated tech giant now finds itself embroiled in controversy, raising doubts about its true priorities and values.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around OpenAI's internal crisis, particularly focusing on the resignations of key figures like co-founder Ilya Sutskever and the restrictive off-boarding agreements for departing employees.

One user highlights the unethical nature of non-disclosure and non-disparagement agreements, emphasizing the severe consequences for former employees who do not comply.

Another commenter expresses concerns about OpenAI's pursuit of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence), suggesting that the company's direction may pose risks to humanity. They criticize OpenAI for prioritizing profit and venture capital over societal responsibility.

The conversation touches upon issues related to workers' rights, the impact of advancing AI technology on human labor, and the ethical considerations of AI development.

There are also mentions of Sam Altman, co-founder of OpenAI, with some users questioning his integrity and leadership, while others raise concerns about the company's culture and decision-making processes.

Overall, the discussion reflects a mixture of skepticism, ethical considerations, and speculation about the future of AI development at OpenAI.

At Google's recent I/O presentation, the excessive use of the term "AI" left the audience feeling like trained seals, as the company showcased standard features linked to its large language models under the name Gemini. Featuring tasks like license plate recognition in Google Photos and chatbot returns for online orders, the event painted a picture of an impressive AI future. The addition of DeepMind's Demis Hassabis to the stage didn't escape criticism, especially regarding dubious claims on AI discoveries. Meanwhile, tech figures like Sam Altman are drifting into fantasy realms, with musings on human-centric AI experiences and universal basic compute.

OpenAI's recent showcase was underwhelming, showing off a ChatGPT voice bot that struggled with basic tasks while being hyped as intelligent. The allure of AI's transformative potential is waning as companies grapple with imperfect chatbot responses and uncertain monetization pathways. Despite industry efforts to maintain the AI fantasy, rising data center demands and shaky revenue models are putting strains on Silicon Valley's AI ambitions.

The discussion on the submission revolves around varying perspectives on AI language models and their practical applications. Some users express skepticism towards the hype surrounding these models, highlighting limitations in functionality and concerns about overhyping their capabilities. Others share their experiences with running different AI models, such as the challenges and straightforwardness of setting up and using them. Additionally, a user criticizes the excessive cynicism surrounding AI advancements and calls for a more balanced view considering the transformative impact of AI across various industries. The conversation also touches on the future implications of AI developments and the need for cautious optimism rather than extreme skepticism.

### Can AI-generated inventions be patented? A Tokyo court says no

#### [Submission URL](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/05/17/japan/crime-legal/ai-patent-ruling/) | 20 points | by [mikhael](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikhael) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40389468)

In a recent development in Tokyo, a court ruled against granting patents to inventions generated by artificial intelligence, sparking discussions on how to regulate AI's capabilities. This decision was part of a broader transnational lawsuit initiated by Ryan Abbott, a professor at the University of Surrey in England, raising questions about whether AI can be considered as an inventor. The case involved a patent application filed by Abbott in 2021 for a device created by an AI system known as DABUS. Developed by computer scientist Stephen Thaler, DABUS autonomously conceived the invention in question. This ruling sheds light on the complexities surrounding AI-generated inventions and highlights the need for updated legal frameworks to address the role of AI in innovation.

In the discussion on Hacker News, user "spuriouserror31" pointed out that the plaintiff filed a patent in 2021 for a device generated by AI named DABUS, which stands for Device Autonomous Bootstrapping Unified Sentience. DABUS, an AI system developed by computer scientist Stephen Thaler, autonomously conceived the invention in question. However, Japan's Patent Office rejected the application, stating that inventions are limited to humans under domestic law. User "crr" commented that the article's headline was incorrect, as software cannot invent and thus cannot be listed as an inventor on paperwork. In contrast, user "whycm" mentioned a parallel construction where people work backwards independently.
