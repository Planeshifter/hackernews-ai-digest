GitHub user mohamed-chs has created a Python script that allows you to effortlessly extract and format ChatGPT conversation data exports from JSON files into well-structured markdown files. The script can be run locally, ensuring privacy and control over your data.

The script automatically adds YAML metadata headers and includes code interpreter input/output for advanced data analysis. It also supports customization through command line parameters.

To get started, you simply need to clone the repository, download your ChatGPT conversations data in ZIP format, run the script, and check the output folder for nicely formatted markdown files.

This tool can be particularly useful for visualizing and analyzing your ChatGPT conversations, and you can even contribute your own data visualizations by creating a pull request on the project's GitHub page.

Give it a try and enjoy your ChatGPT conversations in beautiful Markdown format!

### Two-Tower Embedding Model

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/two-tower-embedding-model) | 72 points | by [jamesblonde](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jamesblonde) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37631225)

The two-tower embedding model is a powerful method for connecting embeddings in two different modalities, such as images and text, by placing them in the same vector space. It is commonly used in personalized recommendation systems, where items and user histories are the two modalities. The model is trained by creating training data that "grounds" the modalities, such as matching captions to images. By mapping the embeddings from different modalities into the same space, the model can generate personalized recommendations based on user history and context. The architecture of a two-tower model consists of a query tower and an item tower, each encoding different features to create embeddings. The models are trained jointly using user queries and item interactions. Hopsworks is a platform that can be used to manage the collection and usage of feature data when building two-tower models. While most two-tower models connect two modalities, ongoing research is exploring the extension of this approach to more modalities.

The discussion surrounding the submission primarily revolves around clarifications and additional information related to the two-tower embedding model.

One user mentions that they are not familiar with the abbreviation "twr" and asks for clarification. Another user responds that it refers to the two-tower model, which is often used in context recommendation systems.

There is also a discussion about joint embedding models and whether they necessarily imply multiple modalities. One comment references Yann Lecun's talk on learning shared latent spaces for two modalities, and another user mentions that they haven't heard the term being used by Google.

A user mentions that they have experimented with BERT encoders for query and text candidates in their two-tower model, and initially observed a significant improvement in accuracy. They speculate that the similarity loss function may play a role in the success of the model.

One user suggests exploring SBERT for symmetric search with query encoders. Another user shares their interest in the combination of text and image embedding models, particularly for financial transactions and social media interactions.

A user mentions their preference for an n-tower approach and provides a link to a paper discussing it. Another user comments on the relevance of the discussion to AI and machine learning, stating that the conversation seems to be based on algorithms and processes.

There is also a humorous comment about AI-generated suggestions and speculation on the release of Dalle3.

Overall, the discussion adds some clarifications and expands on the topic of two-tower embedding models, with users sharing their thoughts, experiences, and related resources.

### CoRF: Colorizing Radiance Fields Using Knowledge Distillation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07668) | 59 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634018)

Researchers from the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition have developed a method called CoRF for colorizing radiance fields using knowledge distillation. Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods allow for high-quality novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, when applying image or video-based colorization methods to the generated grayscale novel views, artifacts due to inconsistency across views can occur. The researchers propose a distillation-based method that transfers color knowledge from existing 2D colorization methods to the radiance field network. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior colorized novel views while maintaining cross-view consistency. The method is also effective for colorizing radiance field networks trained from infrared (IR) multi-view images and old grayscale multi-view image sequences. This research has significant implications for improving the quality and consistency of synthesized images in computer vision applications.

The discussion revolves around the topic of knowledge distillation in computer vision and the proposed method for colorizing radiance fields. 

- User "blvscff" points out that they are missing some information but appreciate the strong met grand truth photos visual comparison. It seems they are interested in seeing more visual comparisons.
- User "cndntm" mentions that the topic is based on the concept of knowledge distillation. 
- User "klysm" comments that it sounds incredibly interesting.
- User "mdlss" finds the technique of limited data self-representation valuable. They mention using BDRF surface scattering path tracing to recover information in radiance field. 
- User "pffyblggr" agrees with mdlss and mentions that the technique seems impressive

### Mercenary mayhem: A technical analysis of Intellexa's PREDATOR spyware

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/) | 24 points | by [DerekBickerton](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DerekBickerton) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634194)

Cisco Talos has conducted a technical analysis of Intellexa's PREDATOR spyware, a commercial spyware product sold by the firm. The research focuses on two components of the mobile spyware suite, ALIEN and PREDATOR, which work together to bypass security features on Android operating systems. The analysis reveals the interweaving of capabilities between ALIEN and PREDATOR, showing that ALIEN is more than just a loader for PREDATOR. The research also highlights the increasing use of commercial spyware by threat actors and the ethical and legal concerns surrounding their misuse. The Biden-Harris administration has signed an Executive Order prohibiting the US government from using commercial spyware that poses national security risks or has been misused by foreign actors.

The discussion on the submission begins with a user named LinuxBender commenting that the spyware probably uses locally blacklisted Indicators of Compromise (IoC) domains on a local DNS resolver. However, they note that this won't help people using public DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) servers. Another user, gnrms, adds that they searched for the domains mentioned and found multiple feeds that block these domains, including Cloudflare's 1112 blocking domains.

Another user, DerekBickerton, chimes in and suggests that in addition to blocking IoC domains, blocking IoC raw IPs would also be helpful, but they note that this can be difficult as IPv4 addresses change hands over time.

LinuxBender responds to DerekBickerton's comment and agrees, mentioning that looking for Autonomous System Numbers (AS#) like 12 for blocking Content Delivery Network (CDN) applications can be risky. They add that it can be time-consuming but can still be done, sharing two links related to this topic.

Overall, the discussion focuses on the technical aspects of blocking the spyware and the challenges involved in effectively blocking both domains and IP addresses associated with it.
