### Show HN: Fine-grained stylistic control of LLMs using model arithmetic

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/eth-sri/language-model-arithmetic) | 72 points | by [OcelotBane](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=OcelotBane) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38586014)

Introducing "Controlled Text Generation via Language Model Arithmetic," a comprehensive framework that allows for precise control over generated text by combining prompts, models, and classifiers. This framework enables users to bias the generated text towards or away from desired attributes.

To get started, simply install Python 3 and run `python -m pip install -e .` to install the model arithmetic package. You can then combine different prompts and models to create new, controlled language models. For example, you can interpolate between two differently-prompted models using arithmetic expressions:

```python
from model_arithmetic import ModelArithmetic, PromptedLLM

# define model prompt template
prompt_template = lambda formula_string, input_string: f"<s>[INST]<<SYS>>\n{formula_string}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{input_string} [/INST]"

# define two differently-prompted models
M_child = PromptedLLM("You are a child.", prompt_template=prompt_template)
M_adult = PromptedLLM("You are an adult.", prompt_template=prompt_template)

# model arithmetic expression
formula1 = M_child - 0.6 * M_adult

# generate text as usual
ma0 = ModelArithmetic(formula1, default_model="meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf")
print(ma0.generate_text("Write a one-sentence fairy tale."))
```

You can also integrate classifiers into your model arithmetic expressions to control specific attributes of the generated text. For example, you can use a classifier to control the formality of the output:

```python
from model_arithmetic import ModelArithmetic, PromptedLLM, Classifier

# define model prompt template
prompt_template = lambda formula_string, input_string: f"<s>[INST]<<SYS>>\n{formula_string}\n<</SYS>>\n\n{input_string} [/INST]"

# define two differently-prompted models
M_child = PromptedLLM("You are a child.", prompt_template=prompt_template)
M_adult = PromptedLLM("You are an adult.", prompt_template=prompt_template)

# construct model arithmetic expression
formula1 = M_child - 0.6 * M_adult

# Initialize the classifier
C_formal = Classifier(formula1, "s-nlp/roberta-base-formality-ranker", n_runs_per_sample=50, prompt_template=lambda e, f: "")

# integrate classifier into model arithmetic expression
formula2 = formula1 + C_formal

# generate text as usual
ma = ModelArithmetic(formula2, default_model="meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf")
print(ma.generate_text("Write a one-sentence fairy tale.", max_length=128))
```

This framework also supports other operators, such as union and intersection, and offers an LM Evaluation Harness for evaluating language models. The code for this project is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

The discussion on this submission involved several users sharing their thoughts and insights:

- Oranguru mentioned that they found it challenging to change the desired level of formality in the generated text. They noticed that slightly formal content tends to result in a more formal model, and reducing formality leads to more informal text. They also mentioned that allowing extreme control over styles could result in constant battling between different models.
- rscrss appreciated the alignment formula mentioned in the paper, suggesting M_aligned = - M_toxicTurns. They found the framework to be great.
- Roark66 pointed out that the README on GitHub doesn't explain how to replicate the results presented in the paper.
- Der_Einzige praised the work, calling it excellent. They expressed their desire for LLM-related prompt tools and shared a link to a gist. They also mentioned the importance of venture capital-backed startups producing work like this, noting the potential for creative investments.
- spccdt had a working problem and asked for help. They mentioned having issues with kids using too much time and asked for practical comments.
- crtrschnwld added to the conversation, noting that convex SMS models support language models with shared vocabularies and tokenizers but cannot handle models with different prompts. They mentioned applications such as model ensembling and contrastive decoding. They shared a link to a paper on this topic.

Overall, the discussion touched on various aspects of the framework and prompted users to share their experiences, suggestions, and questions.

### Scary AI recognizes passwords by the sound of your typing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pcworld.com/article/2166661/ai-recognises-passwords-by-the-sound-of-typing.html) | 32 points | by [grammers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grammers) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38586692)

British researchers have developed an artificial intelligence (AI) that can recognize keystrokes by sound. By placing a smartphone near a laptop as a microphone, the AI was able to accurately recognize passwords with a 95% accuracy rate. In tests using video conferencing tools Zoom and Skype, the AI achieved accuracy rates of 92% and 93%, respectively, for spying on passwords during video meetings. To protect against this type of attack, the researchers recommend using password managers or typing using the ten-finger system, as well as using a combination of upper and lower case letters and special characters in passwords.

In the discussion on Hacker News, some users shared their thoughts on the topic. One user mentioned that the concept of recognizing keystroke patterns has been around for a while, referring to a book called "Silence on the Wire" and also to a reference to keystroke dynamics dating back to 1985.

Another user suggested using a dedicated keyboard to prevent this type of attack, while someone else mentioned the use of custom mechanical keyboards with randomly weighted switches as a countermeasure.

Some comments discussed the limitations of password typing, such as the use of virtual keyboards with randomized key arrangements for password entry. Others mentioned that this type of attack has been studied and documented for a few years, citing relevant research papers.

One user referred to a scene from the movie "Sneakers" where listening to password sounds on a surveillance tape was portrayed, suggesting it might not be a new concept. Another user discussed the use of physical tokens and 2FA as a way to enhance password security.

The conversation also touched on the use of password managers and biometrics, with some users mentioning the potential vulnerabilities of these methods. The discussion concluded with some users sharing their concerns about the security implications of password managers and the risk of a single point of failure.

Overall, the discussion revolved around various ways to mitigate the risks associated with password entry and the potential weaknesses of different security methods.
