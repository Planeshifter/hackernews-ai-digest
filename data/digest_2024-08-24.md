#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sapiens) | 78 points | by [yoknapathawa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yoknapathawa) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41339163)

In exciting news from the world of AI and computer vision, Facebook Research has unveiled **Sapiens**, a groundbreaking suite designed for human-centric vision tasks. These models, pretrained on a hefty dataset of 300 million human images, excel in various applications, including 2D pose estimation, part segmentation, depth, and normal estimation—all at a striking resolution of 1024 x 1024 pixels.

The Sapiens framework not only boasts rapid inference capabilities—up to four times faster than prior models—but also provides an intuitive setup for developers looking to fine-tune them for specific tasks. With a user-friendly installation process and an emphasis on high-resolution feature extraction, Sapiens stands as a powerful tool for researchers and practitioners alike. As they prepare for a spotlight at ECCV 2024, the open-source community is encouraged to explore, contribute, and utilize these innovative models in their work. For detailed instructions and insights, developers can easily access the project on GitHub.

The discussion surrounding Facebook Research's new **Sapiens** suite showcased a blend of excitement and skepticism among participants. Here are some key points from the conversation:

1. **Performance and Applications**: Many users noted the impressive capabilities of Sapiens, particularly its ability to handle various human-centric vision tasks, including segmentation and depth estimation, with significantly faster inference speeds compared to previous models.

2. **Installation and Usage Concerns**: Some commenters expressed difficulties in setting up the framework, mentioning issues related to installation requirements and environment configurations. There were suggestions for better documentation and clearer instructions to assist developers.

3. **Licensing and Ethical Considerations**: A critical discussion emerged regarding the ethical implications of Sapiens' training data, which consists of 300 million human images. Concerns were raised about the sourcing of this data and potential issues related to privacy and consent, particularly given Facebook's history with data usage. Some participants pointed out the need for transparency about whether permissions were obtained for these images.

4. **Community Engagement**: The community was encouraged to explore and contribute to the open-source project, with an acknowledgment of the collaborative possibilities for improvement and feature enhancements.

5. **Overall Sentiment**: Despite some hesitations, there was a general sense of optimism about the potential applications of Sapiens in advancing computer vision tasks and aiding research, provided ethical considerations are adequately addressed. 

This discussion underscored the importance of balancing innovation with responsible practices in AI research.

### Scientists Build a Simple Gel 'Brain' That Learns How to Play Pong Better

#### [Submission URL](https://www.sciencealert.com/scientists-build-a-simple-gel-brain-that-learns-how-to-play-pong-better) | 39 points | by [wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41337307)

In a groundbreaking study, scientists have developed a simple gel-based "brain" that can learn to improve its performance in the classic video game Pong. By using an electro-active polymer hydrogel, researchers at the University of Reading have shown that this squishy material can adapt and enhance its gameplay over time. Through an innovative interface that connects the gel to a modified Pong game, the hydrogel learned to extend its rallies—demonstrating a form of memory and adaptation that mirrors behaviors typically found in living organisms or advanced AI.

Biomedical engineers Yoshikatsu Hayashi, Vincent Strong, and William Holderbaum utilized the hydrogel’s ability to change shape when electric current is applied and discovered that it recalls its previous movements to better position its digital paddle. Remarkably, it took just 20 minutes for the gel to reach its optimal gameplay level, hinting at new potentials for "smart" materials that could eventually learn and interact with their environment in unprecedented ways.

This research, detailed in *Cell Reports Physical Science*, opens exciting avenues for future studies, with scientists eager to explore the mechanisms of this emergent learning and whether the gel can be trained to execute other tasks. While far from resembling human brain function, this experiment challenges our understanding of memory and learning in non-biological systems.

The discussion surrounding the groundbreaking research on the gel-based "brain" demonstrated a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism among commenters. 

1. **Learning Mechanism:** Some users were surprised at how the gel figures out its approach to the Pong game, referencing its ability to adapt based on previous moves. This raised questions about the nature and processes behind the learning capabilities of such non-biological systems, drawing parallels to traditional biological networks.

2. **Critique of Understanding:** There was some skepticism regarding the understanding of how the gel truly learns—whether it's through positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, or merely mimicking random stimuli without genuine comprehension of the model.

3. **Excitement Over Applications:** Others expressed fascination with the implications of the study for future technologies, such as incorporating these “smart” materials into real-world applications, and considering their potential for complex tasks similar to AI.

4. **Speculation and Humor:** The discussion also veered into lighthearted speculations comparing this technology to concepts from science fiction, particularly "Star Trek," with some users joking about conspiracy theories and other speculative technologies.

Overall, while many commenters were intrigued and excited, they also recognized the need for deeper understanding and further exploration of how such systems operate and their potential.
