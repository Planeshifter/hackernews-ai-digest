### Superintelligence: An idea that eats smart people (2016)

#### [Submission URL](https://idlewords.com/talks/superintelligence.htm) | 158 points | by [082349872349872](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=082349872349872) | [246 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36098332)

In 2016, Nick Bostrom published the book Superintelligence, which warns of the potential danger of a runaway reaction where a machine intelligence could reach and exceed human levels of intelligence in a very short span of time, ultimately causing catastrophic social and economic problems. Bostrom suggests that if we can prove thinking minds exist and that the mind arises out of ordinary physics, then it is possible to create an artificial intelligence that could operate at electronic hardware time scales and be significantly smarter than humans. With the space of all possible minds being large and with the potential for computers to get faster and smaller, Bostrom's argument has gained the serious attention of many thought leaders, including Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk. However, there's no a priori reason to think that we're near the limit of intelligence, and there is still much room for debate about the risks posed by superintelligence.

### Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16300) | 18 points | by [johntb86](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johntb86) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36098879)

A new paper titled "Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers" has proposed a novel approach to handling the issue of limited context length for the attention mechanism of transformers in natural language processing. The approach uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input, allowing access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility. The authors demonstrate that their method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step, and can extend the context length capacity up to 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4.

The discussion on the submission starts with a user linking to the paper and mentioning that the proposed landmark attention approach will be published later. Another user finds the idea of an infinite context length of up to 32k tokens intriguing. A third user discusses the potential limitations, mentioning that an infinite context length could lead to longer computation times and memory requirements. Another user suggests that landmarking and compression can be used to mitigate these limitations. Overall, the discussion is focused on the potential benefits and limitations of the proposed approach.

### Direct air capture: our technology to capture CO₂

#### [Submission URL](https://climeworks.com/direct-air-capture) | 98 points | by [fagnerbrack](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fagnerbrack) | [155 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36093771)

Swiss company Climeworks has developed a direct air capture (DAC) technology that can remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. The three-stage process uses a filter to remove CO₂ particles from air drawn in by a fan within the collector. Once the filter is full, the collector closes and the temperature rises, allowing the CO₂ to be released and collected before it is stored permanently underground by a partner company. DAC technology offers a permanent carbon removal solution, particularly beneficial as CO₂ concentration is consistent globally, meaning DAC plants can be located anywhere, though they must be next to a renewable energy source.

Swiss company Climeworks has developed direct air capture (DAC) technology to remove atmospheric carbon dioxide, which offers a permanent carbon removal solution. This method can be implemented anywhere with access to renewable energy. One commenter suggests that the focus should be on cutting emissions rather than solely relying on carbon capture technology, which only addresses the symptoms of carbon emissions. Others discuss the practicality and effectiveness of various carbon sequestration techniques and the politics and economics surrounding carbon capture technology and renewable energy investment. One commenter raises concerns about the energy intensity and sustainability of DAC technology and questions the viability of the business model. Another commenter points out that humans are only responsible for 1% of annual CO2 emission and argues that focusing solely on carbon capture is a short-term solution, whereas conservation and limiting hazardous materials present long-term solutions.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/news/hot-pixel-attack-steals-data-from-apple-and-nvidia-chips-using-frequency-power-and-temperature-info) | 78 points | by [uguuo_o](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=uguuo_o) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36094760)

A team of security researchers funded in part by the US Air Force and DARPA has demonstrated a side-channel physical attack on CPUs manufactured by Apple, Qualcomm and Intel. The researchers were able to steal data by monitoring chip temperature, power and frequency during normal operation, using information exposed by the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling mechanism. While proof-of-concept rates are low, the researchers have shown that future optimisation of the process could increase exfiltration rates and enable accelerated exploitation by other entities. The paper reports that all vendors notified have acknowledged the issues, but as yet no mitigations have been announced.

A team of security researchers funded by the US Air Force and DARPA has demonstrated a side-channel physical attack on CPUs manufactured by Apple, Qualcomm, and Intel, allowing them to steal data by monitoring chip temperature, power, and frequency during normal operation. The researchers used information exposed by the Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling mechanism to distinguish executed instructions, achieving low proof-of-concept rates, but suggesting that future optimization of the process could increase exfiltration rates and enable accelerated exploitation by other entities. The vendors notified have acknowledged the issues, but no mitigations have been announced yet. The discussion on the submission revolves around the practicality and effectiveness of the attack and how fingerprinting comes into play. Some argue that fingerprinting requires accessing system temperature metrics, which may not be accessible to attackers, while others highlight the subtleties of the thinking process of the security industry and suggest that statistical methods could help discriminate between devices more efficiently. Some participants note that the attack requires access to the system's internal power temperature frequency sensors and metrics, suggesting that the attack should be hard to execute without administrator access. Other discussions involve the grammar and clarity of the paper, technical details of the testing, security vulnerabilities in browser fingerprinting, and the accuracy of pixel extraction in Table 19.
