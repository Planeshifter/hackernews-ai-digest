### Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems

#### [Submission URL](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555) | 171 points | by [trotro](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trotro) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39998396)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about a groundbreaking paper by Yilei Chen from Tsinghua University and the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The paper introduces a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) with specific polynomial modulus-noise ratios. By leveraging reductions from lattice problems to LWE, the paper also presents polynomial time quantum algorithms for solving the decisional shortest vector problem (GapSVP) and the shortest independent vector problem (SIVP) for all n-dimensional lattices within certain approximation factors.

What makes this research especially exciting is the introduction of two new techniques to develop the quantum algorithm for solving LWE. The first technique involves using Gaussian functions with complex variances in designing quantum algorithms, while the second technique uses windowed quantum Fourier transform with complex Gaussian windows to combine information from both time and frequency domains.

The paper details the process of converting the LWE instance into quantum states with purely imaginary Gaussian amplitudes, followed by the conversion of these states into classical linear equations over the LWE secret and error terms, and finally solving the linear system of equations using Gaussian elimination. This innovative approach results in a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving LWE, marking a significant advancement in quantum computing research.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about the groundbreaking quantum algorithm for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) involved various topics:

1. A debate on the scalability of quantum computers and their practicality, especially in the context of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).
2. Insights into lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and the potential impact of quantum computing on existing cryptographic algorithms.
3. Discussions on lattice-based systems like FrodoKEM, the security implications of Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) versus LWE, and the complexities of existing quantum attacks on LWE schemes.
4. Analysis of post-quantum signatures like CRYSTALS-Dilithium based on lattices, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and the comparison of code-based systems like McEliece with quantum-resistant solutions.
5. Critiques on the credibility of quantum algorithms and the need for improving current cryptographic protocols to withstand potential quantum attacks.
6. References to the historical developments in cryptography, the challenges of quantum factorization, and contrasting perspectives on the investment in Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms like Classic McEliece.

The discussions touched upon the implications of quantum computing advancements on cryptography, the robustness of quantum-resistant algorithms, and the ongoing efforts to secure digital communications in a post-quantum era.
