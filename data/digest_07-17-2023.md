### AI watches millions of cars and tells cops if you’re driving like a criminal

#### [Submission URL](https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2023/07/17/license-plate-reader-ai-criminal/) | 77 points | by [thehoff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thehoff) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36764389)

An AI-powered policing tool has come under scrutiny after it identified a gray Chevrolet as a possible criminal vehicle in a drug trafficking case in New York. The AI analyzed the driving patterns of the car using a database of 1.6 billion license plate records and determined that it was following routes known to be used by drug traffickers. The car was subsequently pulled over and a search led to the discovery of crack cocaine, a pistol, and a large amount of cash. The case highlights the potential constitutional issues that come with AI-powered policing, as there was no judicial oversight in this instance. The AI tool used in the case was developed by Rekor, which has sold its automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technology to numerous police departments across the US. Privacy advocates are concerned about the scale of surveillance and the lack of oversight in these systems.

Discussion on Hacker News:

- User "bottom999mottob" suggests that there is a misunderstanding about the AI system. They argue that observing cars in public spaces does not require a warrant and that the question of legality is based on the observed driving patterns of the car rather than the AI search.

- User "NoMoreNicksLeft" comments on the legal aspects and states that the AI system is not intended to judge but only to assist in law enforcement.

- User "FinnKuhn" discusses how the AI system works and raises concerns about the potential for discriminatory searches based on location and a lack of oversight.

- User "01100011" shares a personal anecdote about driving regularly and being pulled over for drug searches by the DEA, suggesting that manual suspicion-based policing can be effective.

- User "glnn" expresses confidence that higher hit rates do not affect reasonable grounds for searches.

- User "jnlsncm" supports predictive policing and suggests that public safety justifies the use of surveillance tools like speed cameras.

- User "tmrd" argues that the AI system operates on the assumption that certain locations are visited by criminals, which they claim is unfair.

- User "spprtngnr" mentions that the AI system is designed to support law enforcement and that any potential flaws should be addressed through improvements in the technology.
