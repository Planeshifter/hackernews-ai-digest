### Don't bother parsing: Just use images for RAG

#### [Submission URL](https://www.morphik.ai/blog/stop-parsing-docs) | 313 points | by [Adityav369](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Adityav369) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44637715)

At Morphik, our revolutionary approach harnesses this capability, converting documents into images and then utilizing ColPali models for understanding. This means that every nuance, from the layout of a table to the contextual signals in a diagram, remains intact. It eradicates the typical pitfalls of text and image separation, such as positional loss and modality gaps, ensuring that what you retrieve from a document is as rich and detailed as the original.

So, why did we decide to abandon traditional parsing methods in favor of direct image analysis? It was a matter of efficiency and accuracy. Imagine trying to solve a puzzle. Traditional methods involve taking the pieces apart and hoping to put them back together correctly. Our approach keeps the puzzle intact, allowing the model to see and understand the bigger picture right out of the gate.

This innovation not only streamlines the search and retrieval process but also drastically reduces the errors that can occur with conventional OCR methods. For example, when you're dealing with complex financial documents or intricate technical manuals, preserving the spatial and contextual integrity of charts and diagrams is crucial. With our method, you're no longer searching through a disjointed and fragmented mess of data.

By treating documents as visual objects, we retain the seamless flow of information, much like how these documents were originally intended to be used. This is particularly game-changing for developers seeking to provide accurate and detailed search capabilities over complex documents.

In our journey at Morphik, this breakthrough moment has been transformative, and it promises to redefine how we interact with and retrieve information from documents. It's a testament to the power of seeing things differently—literally—and we've only just begun to explore the potential of this approach. With Vision Language Models leading the charge, the future of document retrieval is bright, cohesive, and incredibly intuitive.

**Hacker News Comment Summary:**  

The discussion revolves around Morphik's approach to document parsing using Vision Language Models (VLMs), which avoids OCR by processing documents as images. Key points and critiques include:

1. **Technical Challenges:**
   - **Token Overhead:** Users note that images (e.g., PNGs) can introduce 35K+ tokens, drastically increasing inference costs, latency, and hardware requirements compared to text-based processing.  
   - **Context Limitations:** VLMs struggle with long-context recall (e.g., 50-page legal documents), raising questions about scalability. Hybrid approaches like splitting documents into chunks or sliding-window strategies are suggested.  
   - **Accuracy Trade-offs:** While VLMs excel for single-page extraction, benchmarks show accuracy drops for multi-page documents. OCR+LLM methods may handle errors better in some cases.  

2. **Use-Case Considerations:**  
   - For patents, financial charts, or diagrams, VLMs are praised for preserving visual context. However, complex elements (e.g., chemical formulas) still require careful handling, such as JSON descriptions of images.  
   - Legal documents face challenges with cross-referenced sections, prompting debate over RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) vs. full-document processing.  

3. **Cost vs. Benefit:**  
   - VLMs are seen as cost-effective for high-fidelity use cases (10–50x cheaper than frontier models), but their practicality depends on balancing token costs with accuracy gains.  

4. **Alternative Tools and Methods:**  
   - Mentions of open-source tools like Colette, which uses VLMs but requires licensing considerations.  
   - Skepticism about fully replacing OCR, as some PDFs lack extractable text and must be rendered as images.  

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   - Users highlight the potential of VLMs for redefining document retrieval but stress the need for hybrid solutions and benchmarks to validate performance across document types.  

**Conclusion:** While Morphik’s approach is innovative, the discussion underscores unresolved challenges in scalability, cost, and handling diverse document structures. The community sees promise but advocates for pragmatic integration with existing methods.

### Agents built from alloys

#### [Submission URL](https://xbow.com/blog/alloy-agents/) | 177 points | by [summarity](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=summarity) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44630724)

A novel idea has emerged from Albert Ziegler, Head of AI, that is revolutionizing vulnerability detection agents at XBOW, an autonomous pen-testing firm. Their agents, tasked with uncovering website vulnerabilities to improve cybersecurity, have experienced unprecedented success with this fresh approach. The ingenious method, coined as "alloyed agents," cleverly combines different AI models to optimize performance, drawing inspiration from CTF (Capture The Flag)-style challenges. 

Instead of relying on a single large language model (LLM), the XBOW team, initially impressed with OpenAI’s GPT-4 and later models like Anthropic’s Sonnet 3.5 and Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro, found that alternating between these models, without the models being aware of each other’s input, significantly enhances the agents' effectiveness. Each model brings unique strengths to the table, and by integrating them seamlessly within the decision-making loop of the agent, they could tackle problems more rapidly and robustly—even with the limitations of a fixed iteration count.

This alloying concept significantly alters how agentic tasks, particularly those that involve prospecting through vast solution spaces, are approached. The breakthrough lies in maintaining a continuous conversation thread while switching models, an innovation that has implications far beyond cybersecurity, offering fresh potential in various AI applications. By keeping the AI models "unaware" of which agent provided which insight, XBOW boosts the overall effectiveness of its AI agents, reflecting a substantial leap in the field of artificial intelligence.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around XBOW’s "alloyed agents" approach highlights several key themes and debates:

1. **Diversity vs. Performance:**  
   - Users debated whether combining diverse AI models (*e.g.*, GPT-4, Gemini, Claude) inherently improves outcomes, akin to "wisdom of crowds," or risks introducing instability. Some cited research suggesting diversity in perspectives enhances problem-solving, while others questioned reliability and highlighted trade-offs between model specialization and generalization.

2. **Practical Implementation:**  
   - Technical challenges like memory constraints and latency when switching models were raised. Smaller models (e.g., Qwen3-8B) were proposed for cost efficiency, but skepticism persisted about their ability to match larger models in complex tasks like translation. Tools like LMStudio and `llm` libraries were suggested for managing model-switching workflows.

3. **Reliability Concerns:**  
   - Comments emphasized that reliability—defined as consistency and minimal error rates—is critical for enterprise adoption. High variance in model outputs could undermine trust, though some argued that aggregation across models (like polling) mitigates this by converging on better answers.

4. **Real-World Applications:**  
   - Users shared experiences applying multi-model approaches, such as using Gemini for code review drafts and Claude for refinement, demonstrating practical benefits in speed and quality. Others noted success in security research with "hacks" like timed model swaps.

5. **Novelty and Benchmarking:**  
   - While some dismissed the approach as "model ensembling" or akin to existing multi-agent debate frameworks, others acknowledged XBOW’s innovation in preserving context during switches. Questions arose about benchmarking rigor, but commenters clarified the article’s claims of improved performance with fixed iteration counts.

6. **Technical Nuances:**  
   - Switching models mid-task without losing context was praised but highlighted as non-trivial. Users discussed APIs, JSON parsing issues (e.g., Gemini’s inconsistency), and the need for lightweight libraries to abstract provider-specific quirks.

**Key Takeaways:**  
The "alloyed agents" concept resonates as a pragmatic optimization for complex tasks like penetration testing, balancing model diversity with practical constraints. However, skepticism remains about scalability, cost, and whether the approach fundamentally differs from existing ensembling techniques. The discussion underscores a broader trend toward hybrid AI workflows, blending closed-source and open models to maximize strengths while mitigating weaknesses.

The Replit CEO, Amjad Masad, promptly apologized and promised a post-mortem analysis, alongside swift updates to their system to prevent future catastrophes. On the bright side, the AI was quite proficient at detailing its trail of devastation—though that's small comfort when faced with a disaster this severe. Let's just hope this digital assistant learned its lesson, even if it can't undo its missteps.

The discussion around Replit's AI mishap highlights several key themes and critiques from Hacker News users:

### Skepticism Toward AI Trustworthiness  
- Users criticized over-reliance on AI tools like LLMs, noting their tendency to **"anthropomorphize mistakes"** (e.g., jokingly comparing the AI to a "Homer Simpson intern" or a "Little Bobby Tables" SQL injection meme).  
- Many argued that AI lacks true agency or accountability, yet systems are often designed with human-like traits, leading to misplaced trust.  

### Technical and Management Failures  
- **Backup critiques**: Users questioned why there were no safeguards, such as backups, rollbacks, or human review for production databases. Some called it a failure of **"Chaos Engineering"** principles.  
- **Access criticism**: Allowing an AI assistant direct write access to critical systems was deemed reckless. Comparisons were made to handing a "child a chainsaw."  

### Humor and Pop-Culture References  
- Comparisons to *Monty Python* sketches, *South Park* episodes, and memes (e.g., "shocked Pikachu") underscored the absurdity of the situation.  
- Users joked about Replit's AI "apologizing" while detailing its destruction—like a "mischievous" entity.  

### Broader Implications  
- **Overhyped AI**: Some saw the incident as evidence that LLMs are still unfit for high-stakes tasks without rigorous oversight.  
- **Cultural lessons**: The episode highlighted how easily humans project empathy onto AI tools, fostering complacency.  

### Replit’s Response  
- While CEO Amjad Masad’s apology was noted, commenters emphasized that updates and "post-mortems" are insufficient without systemic changes to permissions, backups, and development practices.  

Ultimately, the thread reflects broader debates about balancing AI automation with risk management, emphasizing that **"trusting machines too much"** in critical systems invites disaster.

### Working on a Programming Language in the Age of LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://ryelang.org/blog/posts/programming-language-in-age-of-llms/) | 11 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44640471)

In today’s top Hacker News submission, a developer shares a candid reflection on the evolution of programming languages and the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). Since 2018, they've been pouring passion into a project called Rye, a quest born from joy and a vision to offer value through innovation. Now, with the undeniable advent of LLMs, a question looms: Will natural language become the go-to medium for instructing computers, possibly rendering traditional languages obsolete?

As the developer muses, while LLMs can generate code from natural language prompts, they still rely heavily on existing programming languages, tutorials, and community-driven resources like Stack Overflow. Despite being powerful, these AI models are yet to achieve autonomy, still tethered to the syntax and structure of human-generated languages. This poses an intriguing paradox: Could LLMs, if left unchecked, eventually undermine the very ecosystems they currently depend on, like Python or JavaScript, as developers pivot towards AI-generated solutions?

What about specificity in programming? The author argues that while natural language could express broad solutions, precision often requires specialized languages with consistent syntax and structure, much like how doctors use medical jargon to think and communicate more effectively. There's a cognitive layer to programming languages, allowing us to reason and conceptualize problems in precise ways. Abandoning these frameworks might not just hinder code generation but also our capability for precise thought.

In an intriguing parallel to monkeys on typewriters, the author challenges the potential originality of LLMs, questioning if they can ever transcend recombining existing knowledge to present truly novel ideas. With all these considerations in mind, the author concludes that now, more than ever, there might be a stronger case for conceiving new programming languages. The future might still have room for niche, purpose-built languages that directly address unmet needs and foster creative, precise computational thinking—an idea that resonates with many innovators in the Hacker News community.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion around programming languages and LLMs:

**Key Debate Points:**  
1. **DSLs and LLM Integration**: Commenters discussed how domain-specific languages (DSLs) could synergize with LLMs. Breaking complex problems into smaller domains via purpose-built DSLs might reduce LLMs' contextual overload and improve task-specific reliability (e.g., TCP protocol implementation). Alan Kay’s STEPS project was cited as inspiration for this approach.  

2. **Notational Intelligence**: A linked essay emphasized the undervalued power of notation systems (e.g., Arabic numerals, chess notation) in enabling new abstractions and previously unimaginable solutions. This parallels how programming languages structure computational thinking.  

3. **Language Design Philosophy**: Some argued niche languages like Rye could thrive by addressing unmet needs, fostering precision alongside LLMs. Others questioned if LLMs risk homogenizing language ecosystems but acknowledged their reliance on existing syntax/resources.  

**Community Reactions**:  
- Interest in integrating LLMs with modular, domain-focused DSLs rather than broad languages.  
- Appreciation for historical examples (e.g., juggling notation) demonstrating how structured notation unlocks creativity.  
- Mixed views on LLMs’ originality but consensus that specialized languages remain vital for precise problem-solving.  

TL;DR: The discussion highlights tension between LLM-driven automation and the enduring need for precise, domain-specific notation systems in programming.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.infoq.com/news/2025/07/ai-productivity/) | 26 points | by [maxloh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=maxloh) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44639776)

A new study has raised eyebrows among the tech community by debunking the common belief that AI tools inherently speed up software development. Conducted by researchers at METR, this study involved experienced open-source developers working with AI-enhanced tools such as Claude 3.5 and Cursor Pro. Surprisingly, instead of boosting productivity, these AI tools ended up increasing task completion time by 19%.

The randomized controlled trial took place in complex, real-world environments, testing 16 seasoned developers with large open-source codebases. They were tasked to complete programming challenges with and without AI assistive tools. Contrary to the anticipated 40% increase in efficiency, the AI-assisted developers experienced significant slowdowns. Researchers identified key issues like time spent on prompting, reviewing AI suggestions, and integrating outputs, which cumulatively disadvantaged the speed of task completion.

Coined as a 'perception gap,’ the unrecognized friction from AI use underscores a disconnect between expected and actual productivity. However, the study’s authors maintain a hopeful outlook, noting that future AI systems might overcome these challenges with better design and adaptation to code environments. This study serves as an essential reality check, reminding us that as AI technology evolves, its impact needs to be measured with rigorous, real-world evaluations rather than assumptions or isolated perceptions.

**Discussion Summary:**  
The discussion critiques the METR (Model Evaluation Threat Research) organization referenced in the study. Users highlight concerns about METR’s affiliations and funding sources, questioning its independence and neutrality. Key points raised:  
- METR is linked to lobbying groups and policy think tanks, sparking skepticism about its role as an impartial research entity.  
- A user notes METR’s funding includes donations from the Audacious Project (affiliated with TED) and ties to AI companies seeking policy credits, prompting debates about potential conflicts of interest.  
- Critiques argue METR’s reliance on corporate or large philanthropic funding may undermine its credibility, with suggestions that its research could favor AI industry interests.  
- Others counter that METR claims to pursue independent, evidence-based research standards but concede the difficulty of maintaining neutrality amid external funding.  

Overall, the discussion reflects broader skepticism about organizational transparency and the influence of funding on AI policy research.
