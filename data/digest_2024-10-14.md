#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/10/llms-cant-perform-genuine-logical-reasoning-apple-researchers-suggest/) | 100 points | by [samizdis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samizdis) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41842194)

A new study by a team of Apple engineers highlights significant limitations in the mathematical reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs), challenging the narrative promoted by AI leaders like OpenAI and Google. Titled "GSM-Symbolic: Understanding the Limitations of Mathematical Reasoning in Large Language Models," the study investigates how minor alterations to benchmark math problems can lead to strikingly poor performance in LLMs, suggesting that these models lack true logical reasoning capabilities.

The researchers modified a set of grade-school math problems from GSM8K by simply swapping names and numbers, a method designed to avoid "data contamination." Surprisingly, this led to an accuracy drop across more than 20 tested state-of-the-art models, showing a decrease of up to 9.2%. Even more striking was the inconsistency observed during tests—accuracy variation of up to 15% was noted within single models, indicating a reliance on pattern matching rather than formal reasoning.

Adding irrelevant information to the problems proved even more detrimental. In their GSM-NoOp benchmark, introducing inconsequential details caused "catastrophic" drops in performance, with some models' accuracy plummeting by as much as 65.7%. This suggests that, rather than understanding problems holistically, LLMs often attempt to manipulate data based on memorized patterns from their training, leading to critical reasoning flaws.

Ultimately, while high accuracy on basic benchmarks remains impressive, the findings raise questions about the underlying logic of LLMs, highlighting their fragile, probabilistic approach to reasoning rather than genuine comprehension—a crucial insight as AI continues to evolve.
