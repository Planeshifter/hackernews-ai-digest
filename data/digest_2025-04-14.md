In a fascinating dive into privacy-centric tech development, Apple recently announced its latest advancements in differential privacy to enhance Apple Intelligence without compromising user data. Apple's philosophy that privacy is a fundamental human right steers its practices, notably in areas like device analytics, where differential privacy has been a staple.

Differential privacy allows Apple to gauge product usage and refine user experiences while safeguarding individual data. This technique prevents Apple from accessing any user-specific information, ensuring privacy even as aggregate insights are gleaned.

A notable development is in Apple's Genmoji feature. For users who choose to share analytics, Apple employs differentially private methods to spotlight trending prompts without identifying rare or specific user requests. This not only enhances Apple’s models to better respond to multi-entity Genmoji requests (like “dinosaur in a cowboy hat”) but also preserves user anonymity, with no ties to personal devices or accounts.

Beyond Genmoji, Apple is expanding its privacy-forward approach to Image Playground, Image Wand, Memories Creation, Writing Tools, and Visual Intelligence. For more sophisticated text generation tasks, like summarization in emails, Apple is pioneering synthetic data use. This innovative approach involves crafting synthetic data that mirrors real user trends without collecting actual content. Synthetic data helps train models efficiently by creating email representations that are anonymously matched to real trends, leading to richer data generation.

### The Cost of Being Crawled: LLM Bots and Vercel Image API Pricing

#### [Submission URL](https://metacast.app/blog/engineering/postmortem-llm-bots-image-optimization) | 109 points | by [navs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=navs) | [109 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43687431)

In a recent post-mortem, Ilya Bezdelev recounts a misconfiguration ordeal that hit his podcast tech startup, Metacast, which uses Next.js on Vercel, with a potential $7,000 bill. On February 7, 2025, a surge in LLM bot traffic from Amazonbot, Claudebot, Meta, and an unknown bot targeted their site, sending over 66,500 requests in one day. The bots downloaded thousands of podcast cover images, leveraging Vercel's Image Optimization API, which charges $5 per 1,000 images processed. This hefty, unexpected cost was a major threat for the small bootstrapped company.

The discovery of the issue began with a cost spike alert from Vercel that pointed to rampant Image Optimization API usage, which coincided with the overwhelming bot activity. Every accessible podcast page on the platform included imagery sourced from external hosts, optimized for faster load times, but it came at a steep price per thousand images processed, especially when millions of pages were being crawled.

To mitigate the costly situation, they implemented several emergency fixes. First, they blocked known bots using Vercel's firewall rules, though this didn't address the initial misconfiguration of optimizing all external images. They had omitted restrictions on external images, allowing every image requested by a bot to be optimized, resulting in bloated costs. Disabling image optimization for non-hosted images on their own domain stemmed the financial hemorrhage somewhat, though at the expense of slower page loads for users.

Bezdelev and his team also recognized their oversight in underutilizing the robots.txt file, which could have limited bot crawling more strategically and earlier. They adjusted their file, erring now on the side of caution while maintaining access to beneficial bots like Google's.

Reflecting on the experience, the founders identified the need for better spending controls and proactive defensive strategy considerations, especially in scalability matters. They aim to implement sensitive spending limits and improve their handling of potential traffic anomalies to safeguard against future economic hazards. Meanwhile, Vercel's recent pricing changes for image optimizations offer a silver lining and a lesson in startup risk management for the Metacast team.

The Hacker News discussion around Metacast’s $7,000 Vercel bill centers on critiques of platform costs, bot mitigation strategies, and infrastructure trade-offs. Here’s a concise summary:

### Key Themes:

Vercel’s convenience was acknowledged, but its pricing model—seen as a markup over cloud providers like AWS—sparked debate about PaaS trade-offs.

2. **Advocacy for Self-Hosted or Cheaper Solutions**  
   - Many suggested using a $5/month VPS to handle traffic, avoiding platform fees. Others endorsed open-source image optimization tools or leveraging Cloudflare’s caching to reduce costs. Some argued that over-reliance on "serverless" platforms leads to vendor lock-in and hidden expenses.

3. **Bot Traffic Mitigation**  
   - Comments highlighted the need for aggressive bot-blocking via Vercel’s firewall, IP blocking, and stricter `robots.txt` rules. Users debated the ethics of allowing search engine crawlers (like Googlebot) versus blocking AI scrapers (e.g., OpenAI) that ignore `robots.txt` and cause DoS-like traffic spikes.

4. **Server-Side vs. Client-Side Logic**  
   - Some questioned why Metacast’s podcast app needed server-side rendering for RSS feeds, suggesting client-side aggregation could reduce costs. The author countered that features like transcripts, analytics, and cross-platform sync required server components.

5. **Infrastructure Management Sentiment**  
   - Older developers lamented the trend of "full-stack engineers" lacking deeper sysadmin skills, advocating for self-managed servers. Others defended modern platforms but stressed understanding their cost implications.

### Notable Replies:
- **Vercel’s Response (lrb):** Mentioned upcoming bot-blocking features and improved pricing, inviting feedback.  
- **Ethics of Crawlers:** Discussions highlighted how AI bots (unlike Google) often ignore `robots.txt`, forcing harsh blocks to avoid bankruptcy.  
- **Cost Comparisons:** Users noted that even large-scale image processing is far cheaper with self-hosted tools, criticizing startups for not anticipating scaling costs.  

### Takeaway:  
The thread reflects broader tensions between convenience (PaaS/Vercel) and cost control (self-hosting), emphasizing proactive bot mitigation and infrastructure literacy to avoid financial pitfalls.

Whether accidental or intentional, this mysterious entry serves as a reminder of the hidden layers within our digital files, waiting to be decoded by curious minds.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around a Dungeons & Dragons (D&D) campaign where players confront a creature inspired by Oscar Wilde’s *Dorian Gray*, with immortality tied to a mystical painting. Key points from the debate include:  

### Campaign Mechanics & AI Integration  
- **Creative Defeat Strategies**: Players used mirrors and reflections to exploit the creature’s weakness, drawing parallels to Dorian Gray’s portrait. Some proposed integrating AI (like LLMs) to generate inventive solutions, such as "corruption decay" mechanics or magical artifacts, though critiques noted current LLMs lack nuance for such originality.  
- **AI Limitations**: Skepticism arose about LLMs’ ability to craft truly unique narratives, with users arguing they often regurgitate training data, unlike human creativity. Smaller, localized LLMs were suggested for specific campaign tasks (e.g., generating NPCs or traps), but users highlighted their computational constraints (e.g., GPU demands).  

### Game Design Challenges  
- **Balancing Encounters**: Dungeon Masters (DMs) discussed the difficulty of designing balanced battles—avoiding overly deadly or trivial encounters. Tactics like "fudging" dice rolls or allowing strategic retreats were debated, emphasizing player agency and memorable storytelling over strict rules.  
- **AI as a Tool**: Some advocated AI for streamlining prep work (e.g., generating lore or puzzles), while others feared it might dilute the human touch critical for dynamic campaigns.  

### Literary Themes & Player Creativity  
- The campaign’s blend of classic themes (immortality, corruption) with modern mechanics sparked praise. Players’ inventive solutions, like exploiting magical mirrors, showcased the intersection of narrative depth and gameplay.  

### Community Sentiment  
- Mixed views on AI’s role: Optimists saw potential for aiding DMs, while skeptics stressed human ingenuity’s irreplaceability. A recurring joke—AI needing "1 MILLION years" to match human creativity—underscored doubts about current technology’s limits.  

Ultimately, the thread highlights enthusiasm for blending AI tools with tabletop RPGs but underscores the irreplaceable value of human creativity in storytelling and problem-solving.

### NoProp: Training neural networks without back-propagation or forward-propagation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24322) | 153 points | by [belleville](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belleville) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43676837)

Get ready to explore the cutting-edge world of neural network training, thanks to a new paper by Qinyu Li and colleagues that challenges traditional deep learning techniques. This groundbreaking research, titled "NoProp: Training Neural Networks without Back-propagation or Forward-propagation," introduces a revolutionary method that forgoes both forward and backward propagation in the learning process.

Dubbed "NoProp," this approach draws inspiration from diffusion and flow matching methods, allowing each neural network layer to independently learn by denoising a noisy target. Unlike conventional methods that rely on hierarchical representations, NoProp reshapes the landscape by fixing the representation at each layer to a pre-determined noised version of the target. This results in a local denoising process that enhances inference capabilities.

NoProp isn’t just innovative; it demonstrates promising performance on major image classification benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100. The method not only achieves superior accuracy but also proves to be easier and more computationally efficient compared to other propagation-free techniques.

By stepping away from gradient-based learning, NoProp offers a novel perspective on credit assignment within neural networks. This development opens doors for more efficient distributed learning and could potentially revolutionize various learning characteristics.

Stay tuned to see how NoProp might redefine the future of machine learning, as it stands at the forefront of advancing gradient-free methods. Check out the full paper via arXiv to delve deeper into this exciting advancement in computer science and machine learning.

The Hacker News discussion on the NoProp paper reveals a mix of skepticism, technical debates, and broader reflections on machine learning paradigms:

### Key Themes:
1. **Skepticism and Critique**  
   - Users question whether NoProp truly avoids hierarchical representations, a cornerstone of traditional deep learning. Some argue the paper’s evidence is insufficient, particularly regarding claims of outperforming backpropagation (e.g., "vlt 28x28 pxl mgs flw mtchng wrs" and slow CIFAR-100 improvements).  
   - Critiques of experimental results highlight concerns about accuracy metrics (e.g., "9958% prcnt ccrcy" on MNIST) and whether NoProp’s approach generalizes effectively.

2. **Biological Plausibility**  
   - Comparisons to neuroscience emerge, with debates about dopamine’s role in synaptic plasticity and whether NoProp aligns with biological learning mechanisms. One thread contrasts "Hebbian lrnng" (local, biologically inspired rules) with backpropagation’s global gradients.  
   - Discussions question if fixed neural architectures (like ANNs) can replicate the brain’s dynamic, evolution-shaped learning processes, which involve genetic encoding and environmental interaction.

3. **Alternative Learning Paradigms**  
   - Users draw parallels to genetic algorithms, evolutionary strategies, and Hebbian learning, suggesting these might approximate gradients implicitly. Some argue genetic algorithms "prs fr lnchs chn rl calculus" but lack backprop’s efficiency.  
   - Mentions of Ojas rule (a stable Hebbian variant) and Hopfield networks reflect interest in pre-backprop methods that avoid gradient computation.

4. **Efficiency and Practicality**  
   - NoProp’s computational efficiency is debated. While some praise its reduced memory footprint (vs. backprop’s layer-specific storage), others note slow convergence on datasets like CIFAR-100.  
   - Comparisons to LLM training highlight human learning efficiency: children acquire language with minimal data, while LLMs require vast compute. This raises questions about NoProp’s scalability.

5. **Philosophical Debates**  
   - A recurring theme questions whether ANNs need innate structures (like transformer architectures) or can rely solely on general learning mechanisms. Some argue the brain’s "rndm stt prr gttng npt" contrasts with engineered systems, while others emphasize evolution’s role in shaping learning.

### Notable Threads:
- **"Hebbian vs. Backprop"**: Users discuss whether local, biologically plausible rules can approximate global gradient descent.  
- **"LLMs vs. Human Learning"**: Debates contrast human children’s data-efficient language acquisition with LLMs’ brute-force training.  
- **"Genetic Algorithms as Gradient Approximators"**: Some suggest evolutionary strategies implicitly encode gradients, though less efficiently.

### Conclusion:
The discussion reflects cautious interest in NoProp’s potential to challenge backpropagation but underscores unresolved questions about scalability, biological relevance, and hierarchical learning. Broader themes highlight the tension between engineered efficiency and biologically inspired models, as well as skepticism toward claims of revolutionary breakthroughs without robust evidence.
