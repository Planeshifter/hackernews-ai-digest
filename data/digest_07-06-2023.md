### Scaling Transformers to 1B Tokens

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02486) | 225 points | by [mottiden](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mottiden) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36614774)

Researchers have introduced LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to over 1 billion tokens, while maintaining performance on shorter sequences. The authors propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance between tokens grows. LongNet has several advantages, including linear computation complexity, the ability to serve as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences, and seamless integration with existing Transformer-based optimization. The experiments show that LongNet performs well on long-sequence modeling and general language tasks, opening up possibilities for modeling very long sequences, such as treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of the LongNet model and its implications. Here are some key points raised by commenters:

- One commenter suggests that the traditional O(N^2) attention mechanism in Transformers imposes limitations on network size, and the proposed dilated attention in LongNet overcomes this limitation by exponentially expanding the attentive field as the distance between tokens increases.

- Another commenter points out that the Bitter Lesson in machine learning is that eventually, machine learning methods based on heuristics will struggle to effectively train on deep sequential data, such as with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long-range dependencies. They suggest that alternative architectures, such as convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) and Transformers, have shown better performance in scaling.

- A discussion emerges regarding the importance of scaling both computation and data in machine learning. It is suggested that scaling computation alone may not be sufficient, as there are cases where even an infinite amount of data is required for effective training. Clever human algorithms, different learners, and large-scale machine learning systems are all considered in terms of efficiently scaling computation.

- Some commenters provide further insights on techniques like Laplace transforms and compression methods, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to handle long sequences of data in a compressed format.

- The comparison between GPT and RNNs is brought up, implying that while GPT scales better in terms of sequence length, RNNs may have slower training times due to the need for backpropagation through time.

- The RWKV (Random Walk Key-Value) model is mentioned, and it is noted that the current versions of RWKV struggle with long sequences and experimentations are being conducted to address this limitation.

- A couple of commenters discuss the practicality of using very long context windows, with one mentioning Claude's 1M context window as a flawed approximation, while another brings up the idea of applying sampling and compression techniques to handle long sequences.

- The idea of efficiency versus functionality in current technological systems is raised, with a suggestion that the method of achieving performance may be more important than simply scaling computation.

- The importance of considering the scalability of both models and training tasks is mentioned, along with the potential for progress in multi-modal model inputs and data selection for effective training.

- The discussion concludes with the reminder to not discount local maxima in the pursuit of scaling, as there are complex factors at play in both the human brain and intelligent computational systems.
