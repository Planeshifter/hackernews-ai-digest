#### [Submission URL](https://izzys.casa/2024/08/463-python-interpreters/) | 158 points | by [SAHChandler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SAHChandler) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41403286)

As the programming world eagerly anticipates the arrival of Python 3.13, a renewed focus has emerged on the long-debated Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The introduction of an optional GIL via PEP 703 could signal a significant shift in Python's performance, particularly for multithreaded applications—a long-held dream for many developers. Alongside this, PEP 684 offers a per-interpreter GIL, a new approach introduced in Python 3.12 that aims to enhance the concurrency model.

In an insightful post, a programmer reflects on their journey through Python's threading complexities, tracing back to a formative experience at a game development camp in 2005. It was there that they encountered, and vividly learned about, the GIL's notorious limitations—most notably when their attempts to use threading to optimize sprite loading resulted in slower performance. 

Drawing historical parallels, the author discusses how the GIL has shaped Python's C API and its usability in various applications, noting that even popular games like Civilization IV faced performance challenges due to this architectural decision. The post not only delves into the evolution of threading in Python but also highlights the dual efforts of the Python community to navigate and mitigate the GIL's impact.

With a personal anecdote to ground the technical overview, the writer emphasizes the ongoing struggle and frustration developers have faced over the years regarding Python's handling of concurrency, hinting at a brighter future with the new proposals on the horizon. As Python continues to evolve, the community is hopeful that these developments will finally pave the way for more efficient multithreading capabilities.

In the Hacker News discussion surrounding the anticipated Python 3.13 and its proposed changes to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), users engage in a deep exploration of the implications of PEP 703 and PEP 684. 

One user expresses excitement about the potential for improved multithreading capabilities, remarking on the challenging realities of Python’s threading system, especially in practical applications like game development. This sentiment is echoed by another participant, who asserts that regardless of the changes, developers will still need to navigate complexities with Python’s threading.

Several contributors debate the specifics of the GIL and its interaction with the Python interpreter, with one clarifying that PEP 684 allows for multiple CPython interpreters to operate without the GIL interfering in their independent states. There are humorous interjections about the challenges posed by threading, comparing them to pop culture references.

Discussions also touch on the technicalities of embedding interpreters and the performance implications, while some users joke about broader issues like HTTP status codes and project deployment challenges.

Overall, the exchange reflects a mix of optimism for Python's future capabilities, skepticism rooted in past experiences, and a community eager to contribute to the dialogue on making Python a better tool for multithreading and concurrency.

In a startling revelation, Cox Communications has stirred up privacy concerns by allegedly showcasing its ability to monitor users through microphones embedded in various devices, including smartphones and smart TVs. Internal documents, as reported by 404 Media, suggest that the company has developed a program called “Active Listening,” which purportedly allows it to capture conversations for targeted advertising. This revelation follows a history of interest from the cable industry in using surveillance technology to exploit consumer behavior.

Initially boasting about this technology on their website, Cox quickly retracted its claims following media scrutiny, asserting instead that they only access anonymized data. However, leaked pitch materials reveal a different narrative, explicitly indicating the use of real-time voice data to enhance marketing campaigns. The implications of such surveillance practices are troubling, especially in a landscape lacking robust privacy regulations and oversight.

As the U.S. grapples with insufficient consumer protection laws, the public is left questioning the extent of surveillance they face in their own homes. This situation highlights a growing concern over corporate data practices and the real risks associated with the increasing interconnectedness of smart devices.

The discussion surrounding the revelation about Cox Communications’ alleged ability to monitor users through microphones embedded in devices was rich and multifaceted. Participants expressed skepticism about the practical capabilities and intentions of Cox, particularly regarding the feasibility of real-time monitoring across various devices like smartphones and smart TVs. 

Some commenters pointed to historical instances of surveillance and privacy violations, drawing parallels with past concerns about tech companies like Facebook and their methods of data collection. They highlighted public anxiety stemming from the interconnectedness of smart devices and the potential for covert listening. The narrative was interspersed with mentions of legal frameworks that allow certain types of surveillance, raising questions about the adequacy of consumer privacy protections.

A strong theme emerging in the comments was a critique of corporate practices in the tech industry, emphasizing the need for robust regulations to safeguard user privacy. Participants acknowledged a general mistrust toward big tech companies and shared wariness about corporate exploitation of consumer data. However, some doubted the extent of surveillance capabilities claimed by Cox, suggesting that while the company may have intentions to leverage data for marketing purposes, the practical execution of such surveillance would be limited by technological constraints and privacy safeguards inherent in device designs.

Overall, the discussion underscored a growing concern among the public about privacy rights and the ethical responsibilities of corporations in a digitally connected world.
