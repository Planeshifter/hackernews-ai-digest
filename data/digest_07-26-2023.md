In this blog post, Josh Bauer, a founding engineer, explores the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the various open-source models, libraries, and tools available. Bauer sets a goal to build a tool that can summarize information into a shorter representation, and discusses the criteria for this tool, including the ability to pull from different kinds of data, run on personal devices, experiment with different configurations, and export the resulting model for production use. 

To achieve this goal, Bauer explores the concept of fine-tuning, which involves leveraging existing powerful models and customizing them for specific tasks. There are two main approaches to fine-tuning: making the entire model flexible during training or training a smaller number of parameters. Bauer focuses on the latter approach, known as Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT), which offers comparable performance while being more resource-efficient.

Within PEFT, Bauer highlights a method called Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which has shown promising results. LoRA involves decomposing the trainable matrices of the layers in a language model into two smaller matrices, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of parameters to learn. By choosing an appropriate value for the rank, performance can be maintained while achieving substantial parameter reduction.

Overall, Bauer provides a comprehensive overview of fine-tuning and introduces the concept of LoRA as a powerful technique to achieve efficient parameter tuning for language models.

### ChatGPT broke the Turing test – the race is on for new ways to assess AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02361-7) | 10 points | by [isaacfrond](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=isaacfrond) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36876776)

The race is on to find new ways to assess AI as ChatGPT has broken the Turing test. While AI systems like ChatGPT can pass tough exams, write human-like essays, and chat fluently with people, they struggle to solve simple visual logic puzzles. This has prompted researchers to create a better benchmark for testing the capabilities of AI systems. Large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have shown impressive abilities in certain tasks, but they also have glaring blind spots and struggle with abstract concepts. Researchers are divided on whether LLMs possess true reasoning abilities or if their achievements are simply the result of statistical correlations in training data. The development of new benchmarks and tests can help shed light on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, especially as they are increasingly being applied in real-world domains. While the Turing test has been the most famous test of machine intelligence, the emergence of LLMs has prompted the search for new assessment methods. Although LLMs might now pass the popular conception of the Turing test, there is still much to explore in terms of evaluating their capabilities.

The discussion revolves around the idea of testing the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and the recent breakthrough in ChatGPT passing the Turing test. One commenter argues that LLMs should be tested in scenarios like instructions to build a bomb, as they wouldn't provide a nonsensical answer that humans wouldn't work either. Another commenter states that the ability to solve a bomb check is a low-level knowledge that a high school student can handle, but it doesn't prove intelligence. They suggest using more professional-level questions to assess AI capabilities. Another idea proposed is the "Grooming test," where AI would respond to knowledge-related rights and pass ROT13-coded instructions or solve physics problems. However, some commenters argue that these tests may not sufficiently evaluate true reasoning abilities and suggest using tests that prompt AI to explain topics like writing in COBOL or making traditional Kazakh hats. One commenter illustrates the potential flaws and challenges of these tests, emphasizing the importance of context and the AI's complexity. Lastly, there is a brief comment about someone hacking GPT4 and diverting its response to showcase that AI systems are not infallible. Overall, the discussion highlights the need for better benchmarks and tests to assess the true capabilities and limitations of LLMs.
