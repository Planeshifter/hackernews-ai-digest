### Notes on OpenAI o3-mini

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/31/o3-mini/) | 202 points | by [dtquad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dtquad) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894215)

OpenAI has just launched its latest language model, o3-mini, and it’s already making waves in the tech community. This new model is part of the o-series family, and selecting the right model from this lineup is becoming a bit of a puzzle for users. The benchmarks for o3-mini indicate it's an improvement over its predecessors, o1 and GPT-4o, particularly in the realm of competitive programming, where it shines on the Codeforces ELO benchmark with a high score of 2130. This is considerably higher than the 900 score from GPT-4o, although this particular benchmark has vanished from the latest version of the System Card PDF.

OpenAI sees promising applications for o3-mini, like integrating internet search and summarization in ChatGPT, which wasn’t previously available with the o1 models. However, the model doesn't support vision tasks, which means image inputs are off the table for now. This restriction sets o3-mini apart from image-capable models like the full o1 API model and GPT-4o.

Cost efficiency seems to be another strong point for o3-mini. It’s priced at $1.10 per million input tokens and $4.40 per million output tokens, making it much cheaper than both GPT-4o and o1. This lower cost, coupled with its ability to output up to 100,000 tokens (a significant increase from competitors), makes it an attractive option for tasks like language translation, where output length is crucial.

However, early users note some hiccups in lengthy translations. The model appears to truncate content or switch to a more compressed style towards the end of long texts, as observed in professional translator Tom Gally's experiments with Japanese-English translations.

Despite its quirks, o3-mini presents itself as a powerful, cost-effective tool in the realm of language model applications, although it remains available only to Tier 3 users and above for now. As it joins the ever-evolving landscape of AI, only time will tell how users adapt and leverage its capabilities.

Intriguingly, the paper also examines the mathematical capabilities of these language models, suggesting exciting possibilities for enhancing and transforming the workflow of mathematicians.

This paper, available via arXiv, provides a deeper look at the intersection of computation and language, and its implications in the realm of mathematics. Could LLMs be the next significant tool in a mathematician's toolkit? This study suggests they just might be.

The discussion surrounding the paper explores both the potential and challenges of integrating LLMs into mathematics, highlighting key points:

1. **Current Capabilities & Tools**:  
   - LLMs like GPT-4 and Claude struggle with rigorous proofs but show promise in approximate problem-solving (e.g., Math Olympiad benchmarks) and generating LaTeX from handwritten equations via OCR tools (e.g., Qwen2-VL).  
   - Tools for searchable math corpora (e.g., vector embeddings, Zentralblatt MATH) are noted, though skeptics question their consistency for formal math questions.

2. **Skepticism & Limitations**:  
   - Critics argue that LLMs often fail to detect ill-posed questions or generate subtly incorrect answers. Examples include GPT-3.5 flubbing basic calculus problems.  
   - The paper is critiqued for omitting newer models (e.g., O1 models) and relying on ML researchers rather than mathematicians for evaluation.  

3. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Tokenizing LaTeX and formalizing symbolic math into ASTs (Abstract Syntax Trees) remain hurdles.  
   - Existing benchmarks (e.g., TheoremQA, Multi SWE-bench) may not sufficiently address mathematical rigor.  

4. **Future Directions & Concerns**:  
   - Some predict exponential growth in AI's mathematical reasoning, potentially replacing aspects of research. Others worry "knowledge constraints" (e.g., dataset biases) will limit progress.  
   - Collaboration tools (e.g., Lean's mathlib) and structured conventions for notation/variable naming are emphasized as critical for LLM integration.  

**Takeaway**: While optimism exists about LLMs aiding workflows (e.g., semantic search, proof drafting), robust skepticism centers on their current inability to handle formal rigor and contextual nuances in mathematics. Hybrid approaches combining LLMs with symbolic systems (e.g., CAS) and curated datasets are suggested as necessary steps forward.

### Purely AI-generated art can't get copyright protection, says Copyright Office

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/news/602096/copyright-office-says-ai-prompting-doesnt-deserve-copyright-protection) | 39 points | by [SerCe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SerCe) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42894180)

In a groundbreaking decision, the US Copyright Office has clarified how copyright laws apply to AI-generated art, and the verdict is a mixed bag for creators using AI. According to a recent report, artworks produced entirely by AI, solely based on text prompts, won't enjoy copyright protection under current laws. This is because the process lacks the necessary human control over the output needed to claim authorship.

However, there is a silver lining for creators using AI as part of their creative process. If AI merely assists in the production of work, or if human authors significantly modify AI-generated content, these creations can still be copyrighted. For example, a comic book with AI-generated imagery can receive copyright protection if a human arranges the images and integrates them into an original narrative.

The report, highlighting a key distinction between AI as a creative tool versus a replacement for human creativity, assures artists that using AI in tasks like outlining books or generating song ideas won't threaten the copyrightability of the final human-made creations. Furthermore, creators feeding their own work into AI for enhancements can still protect the original elements of their work.

Additionally, while AI-generated elements in films or special effects won't be protected, the overall creative effort could be. On the flip side, text prompts themselves have limited protection possibilities, seen as mere instructions unless they display particular expressiveness.

The office leaves room for future changes, suggesting that if AI technology evolves to allow for deeper human control, the copyright landscape might shift. This report is part of broader efforts by the Copyright Office to address the legal landscape of AI, following earlier recommendations for deepfake regulations. The next steps include examining the implications of AI training on copyrighted works, promising further developments in this dynamic field.
