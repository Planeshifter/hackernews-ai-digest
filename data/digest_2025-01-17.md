### Let's talk about AI and end-to-end encryption

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2025/01/17/lets-talk-about-ai-and-end-to-end-encryption/) | 238 points | by [chmaynard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chmaynard) | [98 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42734478)

We can expect even more integration of AI into our devices, often intersecting in significant ways with privacy considerations, particularly regarding end-to-end encryption.

Matthew Green's insightful analysis explores this complex relationship, sparked by a foundational paper from New York University and Cornell University researchers. Green reflects on how the advent of AI-driven features, such as those in Google and Apple's offerings, raises pressing questions about data privacy and encryption. While end-to-end encryption has revolutionized how we keep our messages secure by ensuring that only the sender and recipient can access plaintext contents, integrating AI often requires server-side processing, which could compromise this security.

He delves into the evolution of data encryption over the last decade, emphasizing how platforms like Signal and WhatsApp ushered in a new era of secure communications. However, as AI functionalities proliferate—enabling features like message summarization or scam detection—there's a tug-of-war between privacy and the need for computational intelligence. Green underscores the dilemma: to harness AI's potential, we may need to relinquish the very privacy protections that end-to-end encryption secures.

With this dual influence of AI and encryption, he raises an important question about the future of communication security. Can we effectively leverage advanced AI models without sacrificing the privacy that end-to-end encryption has fought hard to establish? As these technologies continue to evolve, it’s clear that the answers to these questions will shape the landscape of digital privacy going forward.

The discussion surrounding the submission emphasizes the tension between AI integration and data privacy, particularly in the context of end-to-end encryption. Participants express concerns over how AI technologies, which often rely on server-side processing, could undermine the privacy guarantees provided by encryption. 

Key points raised include the fear of wrongful convictions fueled by AI detection systems, as historical precedents reveal the potential for errors in criminal investigations tied to misleading technologies. Users argued that relying heavily on AI in law enforcement might lead to significant privacy infringements, and they referenced specific cases involving DNA evidence and facial recognition mishaps.

Moreover, discussions highlighted broader issues regarding the implications of surveillance technologies and the potential for authoritarian misuse. Participants grappled with the ethical implications of deploying AI in sensitive contexts, especially in light of historical abuses of technology in judicial processes. 

The discourse reflects anxiety over the evolving landscape of digital privacy and the complex interplay of innovation and civil liberties. A sentiment echoed throughout was the necessity for accountability in AI applications, particularly in governance and law enforcement settings. Ultimately, the conversation signals a need for safeguards to ensure that advancements in technology do not come at the cost of fundamental privacy rights.

### Show HN: Compile C to Not Gates

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/tomhea/c2fj) | 132 points | by [tomhee](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tomhee) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42742350)

Today, a fascinating submission caught the eye of the Hacker News community: the open-source project, **c2fj**, which offers a unique compiler chain that translates C code to RISC-V assembly, and then into a quirky instruction set called FlipJump. This project serves as a proof of concept that any program can be distilled down to a series of NOT operations.

The c2fj pipeline starts by compiling a standard C file into a RISC-V ELF format using picolibc, accommodating various syscalls through clever assembly tricks. It then parses the RISC-V instructions and adapts them into FlipJump's compact macro-based operations, maintaining efficiency even in large codebases—making the compilation times independent of code size.

Developers can effortlessly install c2fj and start compiling C files with ease, supported by various flags for flexibility in the compilation process. For those working with multiple files, c2fj can integrate with Makefile strategies to streamline builds.

With its unique approach and robust functionality, c2fj stands out as an innovative tool in the evolving landscape of programming languages and compiler technologies. If you're interested in pushing the boundaries of what's possible in compilation, this project is worth checking out! 

To learn more about c2fj and give it a try, you can find the project on GitHub.

The discussion surrounding the **c2fj** compiler submission on Hacker News featured a wide range of comments reflecting on the project's implications and features. Here’s a summary of the key points:

1. **Similar Projects**: Some commenters pointed out similarities between **c2fj** and other compiler and obfuscation projects, like Battelle's Cantor Dust and mvfsctr, which aim to transform code in interesting ways.

2. **Security Applications**: There were mentions of how tools like **c2fj** could play a role in security research, especially in reverse engineering and the manipulation of binaries.

3. **Compilation Concerns**: The efficacy of **c2fj** in generating efficient assembly code was debated, with some expressing curiosity about its performance and others suggesting potential shortcomings.

4. **Technical Insights**: A number of comments explored the underlying technical processes related to self-modifying code and the FlipJump instruction set, revealing a deep dive into the mechanics of how the compiler operates.

5. **Project Accessibility**: Overall, there was enthusiasm about the ease of use and installation of **c2fj**, as well as its compatibility with common development practices like Makefiles.
