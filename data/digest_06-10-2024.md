### Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03003) | 10 points | by [prince617](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=prince617) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40634775)

Today on Hacker News, a fascinating paper titled "Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs" was shared. The paper, authored by Sahil Bhatia and four others, explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically transpile code while ensuring functional correctness guarantees. The proposal, called LLMLift, leverages LLMs to reason about programs and generate proofs for functional equivalence during code translation, ultimately outperforming previous tools in both benchmarks transpiled and transpilation time. This innovative approach not only streamlines the transpilation process but also reduces the expertise required to build such tools. For those interested in the intersection of programming languages and LLMs, this paper offers valuable insights and advancements in the field.

The discussion on the submission is centered around skepticism regarding the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating valid proofs for code transpilation. One user, "brfbggns," expresses doubt about the ability of LLMs to attach a proof engine and generate valid proofs, which seems to challenge the authority of Yann LeCunn, a prominent figure in the field. Another user, "prince617," responds by stating that LLM answers do not contain hallucinations or possess proof engines. "brfbggns" elaborates, mentioning that while they have engaged with LLM proof engines in a strictly defined formal context, they find them to be challenging as they seem to fall short on providing correct proofs. The conversation delves into the intricacies of LLMs in generating proofs and the potential limitations they might face in truly representing truth. The discussion highlights a critical examination of the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, despite the motivations behind their creation and utilization in code transpilation processes.
