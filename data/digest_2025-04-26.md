### Watching o3 guess a photo's location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/) | 911 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [400 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43803243)

Over at Simon Willison’s Weblog, there's an eye-opening dive into the fascinating capabilities of OpenAI's new o3 model—a tool that blurs the line between thrilling tech and speculative fiction. The o3 model can analyze a photo and make educated guesses about its location, akin to the sci-fi 'Enhance Button' trope. In this particular experiment, a photo taken near Simon's home in El Granada, California, was submitted to test the model.

Initially, the model amusingly claimed it couldn’t "see" the image and needed to rely on metadata. However, it quickly shifted gears and employed its visual analysis skills. The AI impressively deduced characteristics from the image, noticing California poppies, olive trees, and coastal architecture typical of the Central Coast.

In a scene straight out of science fiction, the AI pretended to zoom into the license plate for more clues, employing Python code to crop and analyze different sections of the photo. This ‘zooming’ feature is part of its toolkit, providing more accurate insights.

The grand finale? It correctly identified the scene as Central Coast California, though it initially guessed Cambria rather than the actual location of El Granada. The AI’s first instinct wasn't spot-on, but its second guess hit the bullseye. This functionality is available on the $20/month Plus plan for eager testers.

Interestingly, some users have noted the possibility of the model using EXIF data, although Simon's experiment seems to negate this due to its location approximation. This ability to guess location isn’t unique to o3; other models like Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet similarly wow with their interpretations, albeit with less of that dramatic "zoom."

What sets o3 apart is its integration of tool usage into the problem-solving "thinking" phase, making its operations feel like science fiction manifesting in our daily tech experiences. While the practical effectiveness of the extensive zooming is debatable, it certainly adds to the engaging mystique of these AI advancements.

The Hacker News discussion around OpenAI’s image-analysis capabilities and broader AI implications reveals several key themes:

1. **AI’s Image Analysis Prowess**:  
   Users compared OpenAI’s o3 model to *Geoguessr*, praising its ability to infer locations from photos based on visual cues like vegetation, architecture, and infrastructure. While the model initially misidentified El Granada as Cambria, its iterative "zooming" technique (akin to sci-fi "enhance" tropes) impressed commenters. Some noted parallels with Claude 3.5/3.7’s abilities but highlighted o3’s unique integration of tool usage during analysis.

2. **Software Engineering Use Cases**:  
   - **Code Assistance**: AI models like Claude and Gemini excel at generating boilerplate code, CRUD apps, and simple scripts but struggle with complex, legacy codebases. Users debated whether AI could replace nuanced human reasoning in debugging or architectural decisions.  
   - **Debugging Success**: One user shared a positive experience using Gemini 25 Pro to debug a multi-layered issue, crediting its long-context analysis and chain-of-thought prompting.  
   - **Architecture Debates**: Microservices vs. monolithic systems resurfaced, with some arguing that AI’s context-window limitations might favor modular code, while others dismissed microservices as overhyped.  

3. **Economic and Workforce Implications**:  
   - Predictions ranged from gradual adoption (20–30 years for legacy systems like AS400 to phase out) to concerns about AI disrupting low-stakes industries first.  
   - Contrasting views emerged: HN commenters often critiqued AI’s limitations, while non-technical users reportedly find its output "magical." Jobs involving repetitive tasks (e.g., CMS configuration, basic integrations) were seen as vulnerable, but complex, creative engineering roles remain safer—for now.  

4. **Broader Speculations**:  
   - Some imagined an AGI-driven future where AI reshapes industrial workflows, while skeptics emphasized persistent challenges (e.g., physical-world interactions).  
   - Ethical and practical questions arose about AI’s potential to "memorize" code patterns from public repositories, raising concerns about originality and security.  

The discussion underscored both excitement for AI’s evolving capabilities and skepticism about its readiness for high-stakes, nuanced tasks. While tools like o3 and Gemini dazzle with near-sci-fi features, their real-world utility remains bounded by context limitations and the irreplaceable role of human intuition in complex problem-solving.

In an exciting new development from NVIDIA, researchers Sifei Liu, Shalini De Mello, and Jan Kautz have introduced CosAE, a groundbreaking approach in the field of image restoration and super-resolution. Presented in a paper on arXiv, CosAE, short for Cosine Autoencoder, ingeniously integrates the classic Fourier series into a neural network framework to tackle challenging image restoration tasks.

Unlike traditional autoencoders that often lose image details due to their bottleneck's reduced resolution, CosAE employs a unique strategy. It encodes input images as a series of 2D Cosine time series, captured by learnable frequencies and Fourier coefficients. By focusing on frequency coefficients—amplitudes and phases—this method achieves significant spatial compression while preserving fidelity. For instance, it can handle 64x downsampled feature maps without compromising on detail.

CosAE's potential is showcased through extensive experiments across flexible-resolution super-resolution and blind image restoration. These experiments illustrate its superior capability to manage various and unknown image degradations effectively. In both scenarios, CosAE not only competes but also outperforms current state-of-the-art techniques, demonstrating its prowess in generating high-quality, generalizable representations for image restoration.

This ambitious approach combines the frequency domain with neural networks to create a potent tool for image reconstruction, offering promising implications for fields requiring precise detail retrieval from heavily compressed images. To learn more about CosAE's innovative architecture and performance, check out the paper, video demonstration, and code available on the project's arXiv and NeurIPS resources.

The challenge for the residents of Memphis will be the balance between economic development and safeguarding community health in the face of such corporate initiatives.

The Hacker News discussion on the environmental concerns surrounding xAI's Memphis project reflects a mix of skepticism, criticism, and political commentary:  

1. **Regulatory Criticism**: Users highlight perceived failures in enforcement, with comments like "Parts of the south don’t enforce laws on corporations," suggesting systemic regulatory neglect in southern states.  

2. **Historical Inequity**: Several users emphasize the disproportionate impact on Memphis’ historically Black communities, noting their long-standing exposure to industrial pollution and reduced life expectancy. One user links this to ongoing risks from power plants and questions if marginalized groups remain vulnerable.  

3. **Political Angle**: A controversial suggestion emerges that voting for Trump in 2028 could serve as an "alternative" solution, though the context is vague and appears tangentially related to the core issue.  

4. **Technical Debates**: Users debate the validity of pollution data, with one sharing a Google Earth link (possibly showing turbine activity) to argue that xAI operates more turbines than permitted. Another user expresses confusion over geographical references (e.g., "4km high park 11km downtown"), questioning the accuracy of pollution metrics.  

5. **Sarcasm and Cynicism**: Remarks like "Surprising. It’s Elon" mock Musk’s track record, while others criticize leaders for prioritizing flashy projects like the "Colossus" supercomputer (compared to a "modern Marvel") over community health.  

6. **Ambiguity**: The discussion includes fragmented claims and abbreviated links, leaving some arguments unclear. A sub-thread highlights confusion over whether pollution statistics are exaggerated or miscontextualized.  

Overall, the conversation underscores frustration with corporate accountability, environmental justice, and skepticism toward both regulatory bodies and tech-driven solutions.

### An AI-generated radio host in Australia went unnoticed for months

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/news/656245/australian-radio-station-ai-dj-workdays-with-thy) | 18 points | by [thm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thm) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43806021)

In a surprising move, an Australian radio station has been broadcasting an AI-generated show host for months without its audience realizing. The show "Workdays with Thy," features a digital voice and likeness modeled after a real company employee, yet listeners on Sydney’s CADA station had no idea Thy wasn’t a flesh-and-blood DJ. Using the AI voice generator ElevenLabs, Thy was crafted to deliver a mix of hip hop, R&B, and pop tunes.

Despite reaching an audience of at least 72,000 people, the show failed to disclose that its charismatic host was AI-generated, sparking transparency concerns. Teresa Lim, vice president of the Australian Association of Voice Actors, criticized the lack of disclosure, calling for honesty from broadcasters. ARN Media, the station’s owner, recently acknowledged the AI aspect, highlighting the experiment's success in blending reality with digital innovation, a trend mirrored by other networks worldwide. As AI technology infiltrates even more spaces, the line between real and programmed performers continues to blur, challenging perceptions and expectations within media circles.

The Hacker News discussion about the AI-generated radio host highlights several key points and reactions:  

1. **Criticism of Commercial Radio**: A user dismisses commercial radio as unremarkable, expressing surprise that listeners didn’t notice the AI host. Another jokingly ties the incident to Australian stereotypes like rugby and Vegemite.  

2. **Clarifications on AI Implementation**:  
   - The AI host’s voice was modeled after a real employee from the company’s financial department using ElevenLabs.  
   - Ambiguity remains about whether the show’s spoken content was generated by an LLM, written by humans, or a mix of both.  

3. **Cost-Saving Concerns**: Users speculate that using AI voices and human writers (instead of human DJs) is a cost-cutting measure, noting that writers are typically cheaper than on-air talent.  

4. **Effectiveness of the AI**: One commenter praises the AI for passing a “Turing test” by fooling listeners, calling it an impressive technical feat.  

5. **Community Sentiment**: A brief “dd” (likely an abbreviation for agreement or approval) suggests some users viewed the experiment positively.  

Overall, the discussion blends skepticism about transparency, curiosity about the technology’s mechanics, and acknowledgment of its success in mimicking human hosts.
