### Should Have Used Ada (SHUA) #1 – Goto Fail

#### [Submission URL](https://annexi-strayline.com/blog/posts/1/) | 17 points | by [jaypatelani](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jaypatelani) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41023917)

In a recent blog post on ANNEXI-STRAYLINE, Richard Wai introduces the "Should Have Used Ada" (SHUA) series, highlighting how programming languages like Ada can help mitigate common software vulnerabilities that arise from human error. The first post in this series focuses on the infamous "Goto fail" vulnerability found in the iOS SSL/TLS implementation in 2014.

Wai draws a parallel between the historical rigor of double-entry accounting—designed to catch errors and promote accuracy—and Ada's unique design philosophy, which prioritizes clarity and error prevention over convenience. Critics often label Ada as overly verbose, but this verbosity is intentional; it serves to safeguard against the shortcuts that can lead to critical failures.

By examining the "Goto fail" vulnerability, which essentially bypassed crucial verification steps due to an accidental duplicate command, Wai illustrates how Ada’s structure could have prevented such a situation. In Ada, each operation's result must be explicitly checked before proceeding, a design choice that not only upholds the integrity of the code but also enhances its readability.

The article emphasizes that while programming practices can be improved—merely saying something should be done differently doesn't ensure it will be followed—Ada’s thoughtful design makes it more resilient against common programming pitfalls, advocating for its use in scenarios where security and reliability are paramount.

### Artificial consciousness: a perspective from the free energy principle

#### [Submission URL](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-024-02182-y) | 38 points | by [sabrina_ramonov](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sabrina_ramonov) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41025983)

In a thought-provoking exploration of artificial consciousness, a new paper argues that merely performing the right computations may not be enough for a system to be considered conscious. Drawing upon the free energy principle (FEP) by Karl Friston, the author posits that specific properties inherent in self-organizing systems—characteristics not manifest in conventional computers—might differentiate genuine consciousness from mere simulations.

The traditional view known as computational functionalism suggests that consciousness arises solely from executing the right computations. However, the paper suggests a more nuanced approach, indicating that some additional factor—denoted as “X”—is necessary alongside computation for consciousness to manifest in artificial systems. This insight opens the door to richer discussions about the potential limitations of current AI systems and their capacity for consciousness.

Through the framework of the FEP, the author outlines a mechanical theory that links internal beliefs with external behaviors, highlighting the interplay between a system's physical dynamics and its internal expectations. This dual perspective could help clarify the distinctions needed to declare a system genuinely conscious as opposed to one that merely mimics conscious behavior.

Ultimately, this research invites a re-evaluation of our assumptions about AI, encouraging a deeper understanding of consciousness that may extend beyond computational capabilities alone.

The discussion surrounding the paper on artificial consciousness and its connection to the free energy principle (FEP) touched on various philosophical viewpoints and debates regarding consciousness and computational functionalism.

1. **Philosophical Foundations**: Contributors referenced foundational philosophers like Daniel Dennett and Paul Churchland, with some asserting that examining consciousness requires grounding in philosophical traditions. They expressed skepticism about how consciousness could be defined strictly through computations performed by machines.

2. **Debate on Consciousness**: Several participants debated the nature of consciousness, emphasizing that simply modeling or simulating consciousness computationally may not capture its essence. The discussion highlighted a division between views of consciousness as a computational function and as a more complex, self-organizing phenomenon associated with biological processes.

3. **Falsifiability and Scientific Inquiry**: The conversation included a debate on the principle of falsifiability in scientific hypotheses, with opinions suggesting that some views on consciousness, and related philosophical concepts, may not be scientifically testable or falsifiable, which raises concerns about their legitimacy in scientific discourse.

4. **Critiques of Computationalism**: Some posts criticized computational functionalism, arguing that it fails to account for the qualitative aspects of human experience. Comparisons were made to scenarios where computation does not yield meaningful consciousness, suggesting that merely simulating activities is insufficient for genuine conscious experience.

5. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Participants discussed the need for interdisciplinary research that includes insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and complexity science to better understand consciousness. They underscored the role that biological bases may play in conscious experiences, advocating for a broader approach to studying consciousness beyond computational modeling alone.

Overall, the commentary revealed a rich dialogue about the implications of the paper's claims, integrating philosophical discussions with considerations of cognitive science and computational theories.
