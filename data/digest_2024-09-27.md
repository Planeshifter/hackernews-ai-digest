### AI bots now beat 100% of those traffic-image CAPTCHAs

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/09/ai-defeats-traffic-image-captcha-in-another-triumph-of-machine-over-man/) | 8 points | by [RyeCombinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RyeCombinator) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41675282)

A new study reveals that AI can now completely outsmart traditional image-based CAPTCHAs, achieving a staggering 100% success rate. Researchers from ETH Zurich demonstrated this capability using a fine-tuned version of the YOLO object-recognition model, originally crafted for real-time object detection. By training their bots on 14,000 labeled images of traffic scenes, they were able to bypass Google's reCAPTCHA v2, which prompts users to identify street items like bicycles and traffic lights.

To further disguise their automated efforts, the team employed a VPN to avoid detection, created a fake mouse movement pattern to simulate human activity, and utilized cookie data to green-light their bots as legitimate users. Their successful approach not only outperformed the average human CAPTCHA solver but also raises questions about the future of user verification online.

As AI evolves, the challenge of distinguishing between humans and machines intensifies, pushing developers to move towards more sophisticated methods of user identification. Google's ongoing shift to reCAPTCHA v3 aims to alleviate this challenge by eliminating explicit visual hurdles. However, as the technology progresses, identifying humans in this digital landscape is destined to become a trickier endeavor.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around concerns regarding the effectiveness of CAPTCHA systems in light of new AI advancements. Users are expressing skepticism about the ability of current CAPTCHA designs to effectively distinguish between human users and increasingly sophisticated AI, particularly with the notable success of a study demonstrating AI's ability to solve traditional image-based CAPTCHAs effortlessly. 

One commenter points out that discussions on the difficulty levels of CAPTCHAs have become more frequent, especially as AI technologies like large language models (LLMs) evolve. The sentiment suggests a recognition that AI is redefining the challenges within the CAPTCHA industry, prompting a reevaluation of how systems can maintain security against automated solving. The overall tone indicates a mix of intrigue and concern about the future of user verification methods in a landscape increasingly dominated by advanced AI capabilities.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.axios.com/2024/09/20/openai-largest-vc-round) | 94 points | by [znq](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=znq) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41670073)

In a groundbreaking move, OpenAI is on the verge of clinching approximately $6.5 billion in a venture capital round that would not only set a historic precedent but also elevate its valuation to an astonishing $150 billion. This funding round, which is expected to surpass the previous record held by Elon Musk's xAI, signifies a monumental shift in the startup landscape, particularly in the realm of generative AI.

Leading the charge is Thrive Capital, contributing just over $1.25 billion, alongside heavyweights like Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft, who are poised to back OpenAI's ambitious plans. Interestingly, OpenAI has opted to turn down oversubscribed offers amounting to billions, underscoring its strategic positioning in an investment landscape often seen as risky. Investment thresholds are also notable, with a minimum contribution of $250 million required from potential backers.

To put this into perspective, the $150 billion valuation echoes the entire U.S. venture capital market in 1999 during the internet boom, while the $6.5 billion figure mirrors the total funding raised by all startups across New York, Texas, and Florida just a decade ago. As generative AI continues to reshape the industry, the dynamics of startup funding are changing dramatically, with venture capital firms leaning into the potential profits of a new tech frontier.

The discussion surrounding OpenAI's potential $6.5 billion venture capital round revealed a mix of skepticism and enthusiasm among participants. Some commenters questioned the validity of the valuation and the funding's implications, emphasizing that the news might be overstated or misleading. They referenced earlier discussions on the valuation of OpenAI, comparing the $150 billion valuation with historical trends in venture capital during the internet boom.

Others expressed concerns about the sustainability of investments in AI, with a focus on companies like Microsoft and Nvidia, pondering whether the hype would translate into long-term financial returns. The conversation also touched on the competitive landscape of AI and the dominance of major tech players, suggesting that market dynamics are rapidly changing amid the generative AI revolution. 

Several participants highlighted the risks associated with overvalued companies and speculated how this venture capital influx could shape future investments in the tech sector. There was also commentary about the current state of AI and its future, including discussions on the expected launch and capabilities of upcoming models like GPT-5, which some argued are critical for justifying current valuations. 

Lastly, the dialogue hinted at broader trends in the investment landscape, where FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) appears to drive significant funding into AI startups, raising questions about the health of the venture ecosystem and the expectations set by these massive funding rounds.
