### Developing a Go bot embedding Ichiban Prolog

#### [Submission URL](https://rogersm.net/posts/developing-a-go-bot-embedding-ichiban-prolog/) | 62 points | by [triska](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=triska) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41629474)

In an innovative approach to enhancing Hellabot, a simple IRC bot, a developer is embedding Ichiban Prolog—a GoLang-based implementation of the Prolog language—into its architecture. This integration allows users to modify bot behavior dynamically without the hassle of recompiling the entire bot for new trigger conditions—a significant improvement over the original two-step programming method.

The revamped design revolves around a streamlined `PrologTrigger` struct, which executes Prolog conditions and actions. Instead of re-compiling, the bot now reads Prolog code from an external file whenever a message is received, facilitating flexible and immediate updates to the bot's logic.

The implementation specifically guides through five critical steps: creating a Prolog interpreter, making IRC message data accessible to Prolog, loading the external code file, executing the Prolog clauses, and finally, relaying the output back to the IRC client. By employing this strategy, even simple Prolog logic can trigger responses based on message content interactively.

Interestingly, while this initial setup works well, there’s plenty of room for optimization—like improving interpreter setup to boost efficiency. This integration of Ichiban Prolog into Hellabot represents a significant leap toward a more adaptable and user-friendly bot, blending the strengths of GoLang and Prolog seamlessly.

The discussion surrounding the integration of Ichiban Prolog into Hellabot featured several key points:

1. **Title Clarity**: Users highlighted a minor issue with the title's clarity regarding the reference to Go, suggesting that it could be more explicitly linked to the programming language.
  
2. **Programming Paradigms**: There was a debate about the distinctions between Go and Prolog as programming languages, with some users expressing concern about the article framing the bot solely within the context of Prolog’s logic programming capabilities.

3. **Terminology**: A commenter pointed out the challenge of remembering technical terms, mentioning that there are many aspects to consider when discussing the bot.

4. **Interest in Related Technologies**: Another user drew connections to other modern methodologies such as the evolution of transformers in deep learning, showing an interest in how these advances relate to the development of the IRC bot.

Overall, the comments reflected a mix of constructive feedback on the article's presentation and an engaging discussion about programming languages and technologies relevant to the bot's development.

### Cloudflare's new marketplace lets websites charge AI bots for scraping

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/23/cloudflares-new-marketplace-lets-websites-charge-ai-bots-for-scraping/) | 398 points | by [boristsr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=boristsr) | [265 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41625903)

Cloudflare is gearing up to launch a groundbreaking marketplace that will empower website owners to monetize access for AI bots that scrape their content. This initiative, unveiled by CEO Matthew Prince, aims to provide publishers with greater control in the evolving AI landscape, where their material is often pilfered without compensation. 

In a bid to tackle the frustrations of smaller publishers—who feel overwhelmed by AI bots exhausting their resources—Cloudflare has also introduced "AI Audit," a free tool that offers insights into how AI models interact with their sites. This dashboard allows users to monitor traffic from AI scrapers, block unwanted bots, and selectively allow access based on deals or perceived value.

The upcoming marketplace, expected to launch next year, will allow sites to set fees or even negotiate in credits for their content. While there's skepticism about AI companies being eager to pay for previously free content, Prince argues that this shift is essential for the long-term health of the AI ecosystem. By shining a light on the often murky relationship between content creators and AI systems, Cloudflare is positioning itself as a champion for fair compensation in the digital age.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Cloudflare's announcement of its new AI bot marketplace and AI Audit tool revealed a mix of skepticism, technical concerns, and frustration over CAPTCHA experiences. 

Participants pointed out that AI scraping tools, like Common Crawl, already pose significant challenges for content publishers, as these bots can exhaust site resources without appropriate compensation. Users expressed concerns over the practicality of AI companies paying for content they used to scrape freely, questioning the marketplace's viability.

Technical discussions arose regarding the effectiveness of CAPTCHA systems. Many users noted increased difficulty in completing CAPTCHA challenges, especially on browsers like Firefox, leading to frustrations with site access. A few commenters mentioned various workarounds, such as using VPNs or different browsers, to mitigate the CAPTCHA-related issues.

Overall, the sentiment reflected both curiosity about Cloudflare's initiatives to empower content creators and a shared frustration with the challenges posed by current web scraping practices and CAPTCHA usability.
