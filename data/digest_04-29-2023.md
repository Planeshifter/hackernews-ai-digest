### MIT engineers “grow” atomically thin transistors on top of computer chips

#### [Submission URL](https://news.mit.edu/2023/mit-engineers-2d-materials-computer-chips-0427) | 49 points | by [elorant](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=elorant) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35757072)

MIT researchers have developed a low-temperature growth and fabrication technology that allows ultrathin 2D materials to be directly integrated on top of a silicon circuit. This could lead to the creation of denser and more powerful computer chips for AI applications such as chatbots. The technology significantly reduces the time required to grow 2D materials and can grow a uniform layer of transition metal dichalcogenide material in just an hour across an entire 8-inch wafer. The researchers' process can also smooth out any imperfections that may result from transferring the material, as had been done in the past.

The discussion on this submission is very limited and consists of only a few comments. One user described the technology used, Remote Plasma Chemical Vapour Deposition, and praised the company behind it, Bluglass, for commercially developing the process. Another user flagged the submission without providing any explanation. A third user asked if this technology could lead to better chatbots, to which another user responded positively, saying that it could possibly lead to more powerful computer chips for AI applications like chatbots.

### Study: ChatGPT outperforms physicians in quality, empathetic answers to patients

#### [Submission URL](https://today.ucsd.edu/story/study-finds-chatgpt-outperforms-physicians-in-high-quality-empathetic-answers-to-patient-questions) | 290 points | by [consumer451](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=consumer451) | [405 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35751276)

A new study published in JAMA Internal Medicine indicates that AI assistants like ChatGPT could revolutionize the field of medicine. Researchers from the Qualcomm Institute at UC San Diego compared written responses from physicians and ChatGPT to real-world health questions and found that licensed healthcare professionals preferred ChatGPT's responses 79% of the time. The AI model was rated higher in both quality and empathy, and the study suggests that physicians working alongside technologies like ChatGPT could deliver more efficient and higher quality care in the future. While AI may not replace doctors, it has the potential to significantly improve healthcare delivery.

Some commenters are skeptical of the role of AI in healthcare, with one suggesting that AI may lead to overdiagnosis for hypochondriacs. Others highlight the challenges of accessing affordable healthcare and the limitations of current medical technologies. Overall, there is a mixed response to the potential of AI in the healthcare sector.

### Revealing example of self-attention, the building block of transformer AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jostmey/NakedAttention) | 92 points | by [jostmey](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jostmey) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35757802)

A GitHub repository named NakedAttention has presented a simplified example of self-attention, the backbone of a transformer model. The code is straightforward to understand and is tested on the popular MNIST dataset. However, the use of a for-loop for processing samples sequentially limits the model's speed, but this can be improved by using built-in functions. The repository aims to offer a concise example of self-attention that can be used to understand and construct transformer models. Issues and feedback are welcome to improve the content presented. The repository is licensed under GPL-3.0 and has received 89 stars and 3 forks on GitHub.

There was some discussion around errors in the code which were corrected during the discussion through feedback. Some commenters found the repository helpful, while others thought that the documentation could be improved. Additionally, several resources were shared for those interested in learning more about self-attention and LLMs.

### AI-generated young Paul McCartney

#### [Submission URL](http://webgrafikk.com/blog/news/ai-makes-paul-mccartneys-voice-youthful/) | 16 points | by [ianyanusko](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ianyanusko) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35756699)

Artificial intelligence technology has been used to rejuvenate Paul McCartney's voice in his new songs, and also to imitate the voices of other singers. Samples of this technology include a Beach Boys song, "God Only Knows," with McCartney's voice, and "New," a song with lines from "John Lennon," where McCartney's older voice has been altered to sound like a young McCartney singing. The use of AI to imitate voices has amazed many music fans, but it remains to be seen how artists and their lawyers will react to this, as it takes the "auto tuning" technology to a new level.

The first commenter, sycmrtrs, expresses disappointment in the AI-generated version of the Beach Boys song "God Only Knows" with Paul McCartney's voice, stating that it does a disservice to the original and lacks soul. The second commenter, slck, mentions the various AI models used in the article and points to resources for those interested in learning more about AI-generated music. A third commenter, flangola7, expresses their intellectual interest in the subject but expresses concern about trusting AI completely. In contrast, cmllmllr thinks Paul's voice is a good fit for a Beatles song.

### Deno 1.33: Deno 2 is coming

#### [Submission URL](https://deno.com/blog/v1.33) | 204 points | by [mephju](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mephju) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35750369)

The team behind Deno, the secure JavaScript and TypeScript runtime, has released version 1.33 with a built-in KV database, flatter deno.json configuration, improvements to npm and Node compatibility, performance improvements, and changes to the CLI. The release is a step towards the team's ultimate goals for Deno 2, which include an effortless coding experience, best-in-class performance, and uncompromising security. Deno KV is a seamlessly integrated database within Deno that requires no dependencies to install, and configuration options have been flattened to make them easier to use. Meanwhile, Deno's LSP document preloading and dynamic imports now require fewer permission checks, and the HTTP and WebSocket servers have received performance improvements.

The discussion on the submission includes confusion on whether or not Deno Inc provides cloud services, with some users suggesting using third-party database solutions instead of a runtime-built database, and others discussing the pros and cons of KV storage. Some users find Deno's security features to be a major advantage, while others are unsure about the benefits of Deno overall. Additionally, there is debate about the role of databases in programming, and how a database built into a runtime can impact application design.

### We aren't close to creating a rapidly self-improving AI

#### [Submission URL](https://jacobbuckman.substack.com/p/we-arent-close-to-creating-a-rapidly) | 122 points | by [noAI](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=noAI) | [155 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35752719)

Artificial intelligence has made massive progress in recent years, and while the idea of a rapidly self-improving AI may be a popular topic, we aren't close to creating one just yet. To create an AI that can rapidly self-improve and potentially wipe out humanity, at least one paradigm-changing breakthrough is required. At the moment, an AI that can rapidly self-improve requires humans to construct good datasets, which is a bottleneck for the AI's abilities. Therefore, a breakthrough in automating dataset construction is required to achieve a fast takeoff scenario.

The discussion in the comments includes arguments for and against the idea of a rapidly self-improving AI and the existence of fundamental limitations in hardware and parallel processing when compared to the human brain. One user suggests that a major breakthrough is needed to advance AI, while another argues that current AI models have seen significant progress and comparing them with human intelligence is not accurate. Another user suggests that the focus should be on solving specific problems rather than trying to replicate human intelligence.
