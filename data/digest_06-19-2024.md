The European Commission is proposing a controversial measure called Chat Control 2.0, which would require providers to automatically scan all private chats, messages, and emails for suspicious content in an effort to combat child sexual exploitation material. This proposal has sparked concerns about mass surveillance and the end of privacy in digital correspondence.

The proposal would mandate scanning for all email and messenger providers, even those with end-to-end encryption. While the EU Parliament has largely opposed this measure, the EU Council has not reached a consensus. As a result, there is a proposed extension of voluntary Chat Control 1.0 in the meantime.

Critics argue that the proposal could lead to ineffective network blocking, personal cloud storage screening, mandatory age verification, and app store censorship. Proponents argue that it is necessary to combat child exploitation. The discussions around Chat Control 2.0 are ongoing, and the outcome remains uncertain.
