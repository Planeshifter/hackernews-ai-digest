#### [Submission URL](https://textanalysistool.github.io/) | 94 points | by [gadiyar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gadiyar) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39082524)

TextAnalysisTool.NET is a powerful program that helps users view, search, and navigate large files with ease. It solves the problem of analyzing massive amounts of textual data by allowing users to easily identify and focus on the relevant lines of interest. Unlike standard text editors with limited search functions, TextAnalysisTool.NET offers various filters that users can apply to manipulate the displayed information in real-time. These filters can be used to select lines containing specific substrings, lines marked with specific markers, or lines that match regular expressions. Users can also assign different colors to filters to make it easier to distinguish between lines that match different criteria. Additionally, TextAnalysisTool.NET supports both inclusive and exclusive filters, allowing users to refine their search even further by excluding certain lines from the displayed set. The program also includes a marking feature that enables users to mark lines for quick navigation and filter application. Furthermore, TextAnalysisTool.NET offers a flexible find function for searching for specific text within a file, whether it's a literal string or a regular expression. The program prioritizes speed and ease of use, allowing users to save and load filter sets, import text from various sources, and share filter results by copying lines to the clipboard or saving them to a file. It supports multiple file encodings and efficiently handles large files. Resources such as the readme file, documentation, and related blog content are available for users to explore and provide feedback if needed. Overall, TextAnalysisTool.NET is a comprehensive solution for effectively analyzing and manipulating large textual datasets.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics. Here are some key points:

- Some users mention that TextAnalysisTool.NET is a useful tool, particularly for its SQL query feature.
- There is a discussion about the challenges of dealing with GUI in Java programs and some experiences with poorly designed GUIs in the past.
- The usefulness of MSBuild binary log files and the MSBUILD Structured Log Viewer is mentioned by a user.
- One user draws a parallel between logging and the functionality provided by TextAnalysisTool.NET.
- There is a conversation about using regular expressions and the satisfaction of working with them.
- A user shares their experience with formatting conversaion using ChatGPT and the challenges they faced in converting YAML files to structured JSON.
- The discussion touches on the usefulness of ChatGPT for certain tasks and the cryptic nature of regular expressions.
- One user mentions the difficulty of remembering regular expression syntax.
- There is a comment about the naming choice for the tool, suggesting that "Regex 401" would have been a better name.

Overall, the discussion provides some insights and experiences related to text analysis, GUI design, logging, regular expressions, and the challenges of data formatting.

### SVG images can contain JavaScript

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta/issues/38) | 87 points | by [mooreds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39079943)

A user reported an issue on the Trifecta project's GitHub repository, stating that SVG images were being accepted but not properly sanitized. This could potentially allow a non-admin user to trick an admin user into visiting an SVG image that contains malicious code, leading to security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigations include not accepting SVG images at all or implementing strict content security policies to prevent script execution. The issue has been marked as completed, with the addition of an HttpOnly cookie attribute and a Content-Security-Policy to address the problem.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of SVG images and their implementation in browsers.
One commenter points out that SVGs can contain various elements, such as script tags, external sources, JavaScript links, JavaScript code embedded in base64 encoded form, DOM event handlers, and more. They mention that SVGs can be a potential vulnerability in products and that their device doesn't support SVGs unless it's necessary.
Another commenter discusses the use of JavaScript in SVG images and provides an example of a dynamically interactive SVG image. They explain that sophisticated applications can use SVG's supplemental scripting language to add interactions and animations to SVG graphics.
There is a discussion about the limitations of loading external script tags and the need for a static file server for this functionality. It is mentioned that there are restrictions on loading external script tags in SVGs, unlike regular HTML.
One commenter jokingly says that SVG has reinvented Flash with the ability to have a single SVG file that contains all the elements of an animation, similar to how Flash worked.
The discussion also touches on the history and background of SVG, including the fact that it was an alternative to Flash and that there were multiple proposals and attempts to standardize it. There is a mention of the ability to perform time-based animations and the preference for declarative SMIL scripting.
A commenter notes that SVG has the ability to wrap text, and another commenter mentions that the intended use of JavaScript in SVG is to address sizing issues.

There is a mention of Inkscape appending JavaScript code in SVG files for a mesh gradient feature, with a link to the code. The discussion concludes with a comment about the syntactic differences between HTML and SVG and the allowances for JavaScript within SVG tags.

### Cryptographers closer to enabling fully private internet searches

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/cryptographers-fully-private-internet-searches-cybersecurity-databases-privacy/) | 7 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39079178)

Researchers have developed a groundbreaking solution known as private information retrieval, which allows users to access information from a public database without revealing any details about their query. Previously deemed impossible, private information retrieval has the potential to enhance privacy in applications that require accessing databases. The researchers' work received a Best Paper Award in 2023 and has overcome a major barrier in achieving truly private searches. This breakthrough could pave the way for a private Google search equivalent that allows users to browse through data anonymously without computationally intensive tasks.
The discussion on the submission primarily revolves around the validity and relevance of the information provided. One user, "mrn," brings up the point that the headline seems nonsensical and has a potential clickbait element to it. Another user, "bkfj," shares a link to an archive of the submission, suggesting that it may have been reposted. Finally, user "gwrn" comments that the submission is indeed a repost.
