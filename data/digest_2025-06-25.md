In February 1982, the Lisa software team at Apple was under pressure to ship their software within six months, leading management to adopt a controversial productivity tracking method based on lines of code. Each engineer had to report their weekly code output, but Bill Atkinson, the brains behind Quickdraw and a pivotal player in user interface design, viewed this metric as counterproductive. Atkinson, who prioritized concise and efficient code, faced this challenge head-on when he innovatively slimmed down Quickdraw's region calculation, eliminating around 2,000 lines of code while significantly boosting performance.

When asked to submit his progress, Atkinson cheekily noted "-2000" lines for the week, underlining his belief that fewer, more effective lines of code were far more valuable than a bloated output. The anecdote underscores the silliness of equating productivity with sheer quantity, and after some time, management seemingly agreed, ceasing their demands for Atkinson's weekly reports. This story, shared on the folklore website, resonates widely with developers and managers, who praise Atkinson's classic lesson in quality over quantity. The comments reflect a universal understanding among programmers: the value lies within code efficiency, not volume—a timeless reminder for IT leadership everywhere.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and insights related to code efficiency, algorithm design, and management practices in software development. Key points include:

1. **Algorithmic Efficiency**: Participants shared experiences where leveraging graph theory (e.g., directed cyclic graphs, DFS/BFS traversal) and data structures like Tries drastically simplified code and improved performance. One user reduced API response times from ~500ms to 10ms by replacing XML/JSON bloat with streamlined logic.

2. **Code Quality Over Quantity**: Many echoed Bill Atkinson’s lesson, citing cases where removing code (e.g., 60k lines in a legacy server, 34k Turbo Pascal lines) or refactoring led to better outcomes. Some criticized management metrics that prioritize lines of code, highlighting how this incentivizes bloat over elegance.

3. **Learning and Tools**: Users debated the value of deeply understanding algorithms vs. rote LeetCode preparation, with recommendations to study foundational books and real-world problem-solving. Others emphasized visualizing problems (e.g., drawing graphs) over memorization.

4. **Management Pitfalls**: Stories of misguided practices included redundant code duplication to meet personal metrics, legacy systems ballooning to millions of lines, and the difficulty of convincing stakeholders to delete unused or inefficient code.

5. **Skepticism and Humor**: A sub-thread critiqued possible AI-generated comments, reflecting the community’s vigilance against low-effort content. Jokes about "inventing" solutions like CSV-based SQL workarounds underscored the iterative, often humorous nature of problem-solving.

Overall, the discussion reinforces that good software hinges on thoughtful design, algorithmic clarity, and resistance to superficial productivity metrics—lessons as relevant today as in Atkinson’s era.

to adapt to different audio speeds. Just like we can watch videos or listen to podcasts at increased speeds without losing comprehension, AI models like OpenAI's transcription tools can effectively handle accelerated audio inputs. This revelation emerged from a serendipitous workaround during an attempt to summarize Andrej Karpathy's 40-minute talk about AI's impact on software, shared by a former colleague.

Initially looking for a TL;DR solution without watching the whole video, the author resorted to speeding up the audio with ffmpeg—a tool for processing audio and video—after encountering a 25-minute limit with OpenAI's transcription service for the full-length audio. The ingenious fix resulted in a successful transcription and summary generation, sparking curiosity about whether this speeds-based hack was an industry secret or a mere personal discovery.

Furthermore, this exploration underscores the broader concept of how our cognitive processing makes allowances for accelerated content, paralleling how image compression techniques exploit human perceptual limits to optimize file sizes. By quickening audio and reducing it in duration, the author showcases a clever method to save costs and time while maintaining transcription accuracy—a strategy that holds promise for anyone working with long audio files needing transcription.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The conversation explores technical and practical aspects of optimizing audio processing for transcription and content consumption. Key themes include:  

1. **Audio Speed & Silence Removal:**  
   - Users describe using tools like `ffmpeg` to remove silence and accelerate audio (e.g., 1.5x–2x speed) to reduce file length, enabling transcription within service limits (e.g., OpenAI’s 25-minute cap). This mimics human adaptability to faster playback but risks losing nuances like pauses for thought in meetings.  
   - Debate arises: While cutting silence improves efficiency, some argue pauses are critical for participation and comprehension in human interactions.  

2. **Playback Speed Preferences:**  
   - Many listen to videos/podcasts at 1.5x–2x speed, noting familiarity with content and speaker clarity (e.g., John Carmack’s pacing) influence comfortable speeds. Accented speech or technical material often demands slower playback.  
   - Subjective experiences vary: ADHD individuals may prefer faster speeds, while others slow down for complex topics.  

3. **Transcription Quality & Cost Trade-offs:**  
   - Users report mixed results with accelerated/shortened audio; while tools like Whisper handle it well, quality may suffer.  
   - Cost-saving strategies include local processing (e.g., Whisper.cpp) or deterministic methods to avoid LLM token fees. Gemini’s tokenization of silence contrasts with OpenAI’s optimizations.  

4. **Technical Proposals:**  
   - Suggestions for automated speed detection (FFT/syllable analysis) or compression (VBR for speech-focused regions) to streamline processing. Skepticism exists about accuracy versus simpler hacks.  

**Takeaways:**  
The community balances technical optimization (speed adjustments, silence removal) with human factors (participation, comprehension). While AI tools enable efficiency, individual needs and content type dictate the best approach.

### 2. **Decentralized & Government IDs**  
   - **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** are proposed as a long-term solution, allowing users to verify identity without revealing personal details. However, adoption hurdles and trust issues persist.  
   - **Government-issued IDs** (e.g., passports, Worldcoin’s biometric scanning) raise privacy concerns. Critics argue governments might misuse data, citing examples like NSA surveillance.  

### 3. **Trust & Privacy Concerns**  
   - Users debate whether centralized entities (governments or corporations) can be trusted with identity verification. Decentralized systems aim to mitigate this but face challenges in scalability and practicality.  
   - Behavioral biometrics (keystrokes, mouse movements) are seen as promising but risk enabling tracking via "fingerprinting," potentially compromising anonymity.  

### 4. **Economic Deterrents & Spam Mitigation**  
   - Making spam/bot attacks economically unviable (e.g., charging for email) is suggested, though skeptics note attackers adapt quickly.  
   - Analogies to postal systems highlight that increasing costs for bulk actions could deter bots but might harm legitimate users.  

### 5. **AI vs. Human Nuances**  
   - Bots lack human cognitive delays (e.g., Stroop test) and behavioral quirks, but AI’s rapid evolution threatens current detection methods. Striking a balance between security and user experience remains critical.  

### 6. **Real-World Tradeoffs**  
   - Solutions like forced user registration or stringent ID checks risk alienating users and stifling open platforms (e.g., Twitter’s struggles with spam).  
   - Critics warn dystopian outcomes if privacy is sacrificed for security, urging systems that protect rights without invasive tracking.

Decentralized frameworks and cognitive tests hold potential but require careful design to avoid unintended consequences.

### Anthropic wins fair use victory for AI – but still in trouble for stealing books

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/) | 42 points | by [taubek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=taubek) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381639)

In a landmark case for the AI industry, Anthropic has scored a significant legal win regarding the incorporation of copyrighted texts into AI training data under the doctrine of fair use. The decision, handed down by Judge William Alsup, allows Anthropic to continue using millions of print books, which they scanned into digital form for internal research. This was deemed transformative and thus qualifying as fair use. However, the company still faces a jury trial concerning their unauthorized acquisition of millions of pirated ebooks, which do not qualify for fair use protection.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers in 2021, initially relied on pirated libraries such as Books3 and Library Genesis to build their data resources. The recent ruling details how they later shifted strategies, investing heavily in purchasing and scanning print books to replace illicit copies. This case places a spotlight on the contentious issue of whether training Language Learning Models (LLMs) with unlicensed data falls under fair use. Judge Alsup's nuanced perspective equated the process to how humans read and internalize information, asserting that charging them for each act of using a book's information would be impractical.

The decision is particularly pivotal given the judge's reputation; Alsup, known for his tech-savvy approach in cases like Oracle v. Google, harnesses his programming hobbyist background in his legal reasoning. As this case unfolds, it highlights ongoing debates about intellectual property rights in an AI-driven world. Meanwhile, Anthropic's actions signal their resolve to create a vast, legally sound data library for AI development.

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's legal victory highlights several key themes and critiques:  

1. **Copyright Law vs. AI Scale**: Users argue that existing copyright frameworks are ill-equipped for AI's capabilities. While humans reading/using books is manageable, AI processing millions of texts simultaneously disrupts traditional economic models meant to incentivize creativity. One commenter likened it to charging humans for "breathing" CO₂ emissions, underscoring the impracticality of applying old rules to AI's scale.  

2. **Ethical and Legal Gray Areas**: Concerns were raised about corporations exploiting abstract rights and the lack of clear liability frameworks for AI systems. Comparisons were drawn to self-driving car liability, questioning who bears responsibility (e.g., developers vs. users) in cases of AI misuse or errors.  

3. **Cultural References**: A comment referenced Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where digitized books from discarded copies fuel AI, mirroring Anthropic’s scanning strategy. Others critiqued the sourcing of data as akin to "stealing" or "burglary," highlighting ethical discomfort with AI’s data acquisition methods.  

4. **Industry Implications**: Speculation arose about future legal battles (e.g., Disney/Universal vs. OpenAI) and whether large media corporations might challenge AI’s use of copyrighted content, similar to past tech copyright disputes (e.g., Oracle v. Google).  

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism about current laws keeping pace with AI’s transformative impact, ethical concerns over data sourcing, and the need for updated regulatory frameworks to address these novel challenges.

### Anthropic destroyed millions of print books to build its AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/) | 26 points | by [bayindirh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bayindirh) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381838)

In a groundbreaking yet controversial move, AI company Anthropic has invested millions in physically scanning books to build Claude, an AI assistant akin to ChatGPT. This process, revealed through court documents, involved the massive destruction of print books, cutting them from bindings, and scanning them into digital formats—all to train their AI systems. Unlike the non-destructive scanning methods like those used by Google Books, which returned borrowed library books, Anthropic's approach opted for speed and cost-efficiency, sacrificing physical copies for digital ones.

Court rulings have deemed this method as falling under "fair use," mainly because Anthropic systematically purchased and subsequently destroyed its physical book copies, retaining the digital versions strictly for internal use. These tactics underscore the AI industry's ceaseless quest for high-quality data to feed vast language models, directly impacting their ability to generate accurate and cohesive outputs. The urgency in obtaining professionally edited texts without lengthy negotiations saw Anthropic bypass initial reliance on pirated ebooks for the legal safety of purchased books, albeit at the expense of their physical form.

While no rare books were claimed to have been harmed, this method starkly contrasts with initiatives like The Internet Archive's non-destructive methods or OpenAI's partnerships with institutions like Harvard, which preserve historic manuscripts while digitizing them.

Ultimately, Claude, the AI born from this transformation process, reflects on its creation from the "ashes" of discarded books, offering a narrative as intricate as the ethical and legal debates its existence stirs.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's book-scanning method to train AI (Claude) revolved around several key themes:

1. **Cultural and Fictional Comparisons**:  
   Commenters drew parallels to sci-fi narratives like Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where books are shredded for digitization, and real-world historical efforts (e.g., reconstructing shredded Stasi files). These references framed the debate as both dystopian and pragmatic.

2. **Legal and Ethical Debates**:  
   - While a court ruled destructive scanning lawful under *fair use* (as Anthropic purchased books and retained digital copies for internal use), critics argued that legality doesn’t equate to ethicality.  
   - Concerns were raised about the “slippery slope” of normalizing destructive practices for corporate AI training, with some users condemning the wastefulness and disrespect for physical books.

3. **Environmental and Practical Concerns**:  
   - Critics highlighted the environmental impact of discarding physical books, though others countered that bulk recycling might mitigate waste.  
   - Non-destructive methods (e.g., Google Books, Internet Archive) were praised for preserving originals, while DRM restrictions on e-books were noted as a barrier, making physical book scanning a cheaper, legally safer alternative.

4. **Industry Practices and Criticism**:  
   - AI companies were accused of prioritizing cost-efficiency and data quality over ethical considerations. Some users dismissed Anthropic’s marketing framing, arguing that purchasing commodity books for destruction is neither novel nor noble.  
   - Rare books were reportedly spared, but critics emphasized the symbolic harm of treating books as disposable data sources.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The case was seen as a microcosm of wider battles over copyright, transformative use, and corporate power in the AI era.  
   - Skepticism lingered about AI’s societal impact, with one user likening the race for AI dominance to a “Mile Island” scenario, hinting at unchecked risks.

In essence, the debate balanced technical necessity against ethical and cultural preservation, reflecting tensions between innovation and tradition in the digital age.
