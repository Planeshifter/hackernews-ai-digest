### Invisible Stitch: Generating Smooth 3D Scenes with Depth Inpainting

#### [Submission URL](https://research.paulengstler.com/invisible-stitch/) | 121 points | by [jasondavies](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasondavies) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40221345)

The Visual Geometry Group at the University of Oxford has developed a cutting-edge method called "Invisible Stitch" for generating smooth 3D scenes with depth inpainting. This innovative approach involves a depth completion network that seamlessly integrates newly hallucinated regions into existing scene representations by extrapolating the scene's depth based on an input image.

By conditioning the depth completion network on both the image and the depth of known regions, this model can inpaint masked depth map regions, even in the absence of sparse depth input. The training procedure involves using a teacher network to generate pseudo ground-truth depth maps for images and leveraging a compact training scheme to improve the depth prediction process.

The researchers have also introduced a new evaluation benchmark to assess the geometric consistency and quality of the depth predictions used in scene generation tasks. This benchmark quantifies the depth-reconstruction quality on partial scenes with known ground truth depth, providing a more robust evaluation method compared to existing image-text similarity scores.

The results of this inpainting model show improved fidelity to ground-truth data in both real-world and photorealistic settings, marking a significant advancement in 3D scene generation research. This work not only enhances geometric coherence in scene generation but also sets a new standard for evaluating the structure of generated scenes.

The team behind this project, supported by various grants and research programs, has made substantial contributions to pushing the boundaries of 3D scene generation, paving the way for more accurate and visually appealing scene reconstruction techniques.

1. User "dlftnk" mentioned that the scenes described in the submission have hallucinated interpretation.
2. User "thfrn" added that it is crucial to consider cross-extrapolation capabilities in this context.
3. User "shrmntnktp" pointed out that the innovation discussed in the submission has been duplicated and launched only today, suggesting a reversal in the process.
