#### [Submission URL](https://filiph.net/text/memex-is-already-here,-it%27s-just-not-evenly-distributed.html) | 219 points | by [samwillis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samwillis) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37020001)

In 1945, Vannevar Bush proposed the idea of the memex, a mechanical device that would function as a hypertext system, allowing users to store and access their books, records, and communications. It was an early concept of what would eventually become the World Wide Web. However, the web falls short of Vannevar Bush's original vision of the memex. On the web, documents are owned and controlled by others, and users cannot edit or annotate them as they would with their own physical collections. The web also lacks the concept of "trails" that connect relevant documents and allow users to create their own personalized knowledge base. Despite living in a knowledge economy, where attaining and using knowledge is crucial, the idea of the memex has not gained widespread adoption. There are projects that explore similar concepts, but they often lack interoperability and fail to provide a significant productivity boost. The article argues that for a memex-like system to be successful, it must be easy to edit content, add new material, create links, and comment on specific parts of the memex. Interoperability is also crucial, as software that works with existing files and can be used by others will be more successful than new and shiny but isolated applications.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the limitations of the current web and the potential for a memex-like system. 

One user points out that HTML lacks the ability to easily annotate and edit documents, which is a key feature of the memex. They also mention the importance of trails, which allow users to create personalized knowledge bases, and the need for interoperability in order to achieve widespread adoption.

Another user mentions that there have been previous attempts to implement similar concepts, such as web augmentation servers and specialized browsers, but they did not gain widespread adoption due to issues with shared bookmarks and maintaining link consistency.

Other users suggest existing solutions that come close to a memex system, such as permaweb CMS and Apple's integration features, but there are still limitations and challenges to consider.

The discussion also touches on the history of hypertext and the contributions of figures like Ted Nelson to the development of hypertext systems. Some users recommend reading Ted Nelson's works to gain a better understanding of the challenges and potential solutions in this space.

Overall, the discussion acknowledges the limitations of the current web and expresses interest in a more advanced system like the memex, but there are different opinions on the feasibility and current state of such a system.

### Lisp in Space

#### [Submission URL](https://corecursive.com/lisp-in-space-with-ron-garret/) | 140 points | by [dargscisyhp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dargscisyhp) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37021173)

In the latest episode of the CoRecursive podcast, host Adam Gordon Bell tells the fascinating story of Ron Garret's experience trying to bring LISP programming into the world of space exploration. In 1988, Ron was working on the prototype for the first Mars Rover at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The goal was to develop software that would allow NASA to send an autonomous rover to Mars. However, using LISP, a programming language known for its use of parentheses and treating code as data, was not the norm at NASA.

Operating a rover on Mars presented several challenges, including a 40-minute round-trip light time delay. This meant that remote operation of the rover was not feasible, and autonomy was crucial. Ron and his team wanted to push the boundaries of autonomy to enable the rover to accomplish more within each command cycle.

While Ron's office at JPL was fairly standard, he had access to an electronic shop and occasionally took the robots outdoors for testing. The robots included FANG, a large rover the size of half a refrigerator, Tooth, a shoebox-sized robot, and Robbie, a six-wheeled rover the size of an SUV. These prototypes eventually led to the development of the Sojourner rover, which landed on Mars in 1997.

Ron's team chose to use LISP for their software development, but it was not a common choice at NASA. As a result, they faced skepticism from colleagues and project managers who favored more traditional programming languages. Despite the challenges, Ron and his team continued to develop the software using LISP.

Their work eventually caught the attention of NASA's New Millennium Program, which aimed to develop new technologies for space exploration. This led to the Deep Space 1 mission, which included the Remote Agent, an autonomous onboard software developed with LISP. The mission encountered project management difficulties, but the Remote Agent performed admirably.

One notable challenge Ron faced was debugging code in space. Since the Rover had limited computational power and storage, traditional debugging techniques were not feasible. Ron solved this problem by developing a system for sending S-expressions remotely, allowing him to analyze and fix code on the Rover.

Overall, Ron's experience raises the question of whether using LISP was worth the effort. While it may not have been the most popular choice at NASA, the unique capabilities of LISP offered new possibilities for autonomous software development in space exploration.

To hear the full story and learn more about Ron's journey to bring LISP into space, listen to the CoRecursive podcast episode with Ron Garret.

The discussion on Hacker News about this submission covers various aspects of Lisp programming and its relevance in the modern programming landscape. Some users share links to previous HN posts related to Lisp and suggest reading them to gain a deeper understanding of the topic. Others express interest in Ron's experience at JPL and discuss Lisp's applications in chip design and scientific research.

There is a discussion about whether the use of Lisp in space exploration was worth the effort, with some users highlighting the unique capabilities of Lisp and its potential for autonomous software development. Others discuss the challenges of debugging code in space and the development of systems for remote analysis and fixing.

The discussion also touches on other Lisp-like languages such as Julia, Clojure, Janet, and Hylang, and the differences in their syntax, particularly regarding the use of parentheses. Some users find Clojure's syntax confusing compared to other Lisps, while others mention the advantages of Lisp's parentheses in representing data structures and serialization.

There are also discussions about other programming languages, such as Dylan, Python, Ruby, Haskell, JavaScript, and TXR, and their similarities or differences with Lisp in terms of syntax and structure.

Overall, the discussion explores the merits and challenges of using Lisp and Lisp-like languages in various domains and highlights the unique features and possibilities that Lisp offers in software development.
