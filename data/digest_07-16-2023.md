#### [Submission URL](https://surma.dev/things/webgpu/) | 104 points | by [pythops](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pythops) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36751307)

WebGPU is an upcoming Web API that provides low-level access to GPUs. The author of this post shares their experience with learning and using WebGPU, comparing it to WebGL, which has been the primary API for accessing GPUs on the web until now.

The author admits to not being very experienced with graphics but found WebGL to be challenging due to its design and the need to manage an internal global state object. They struggled with understanding the order of API calls and building abstractions on top of WebGL.

WebGPU, on the other hand, seemed more comfortable for the author. It was designed to be more low-level and provides access to the raw computing power of GPUs. The author clarifies that they won't be using WebGPU for generating graphics but rather for leveraging the GPU's computational capabilities.

The post goes on to explain the limitations of WebGL when it comes to general-purpose GPU (GPGPU) calculations and introduces WebGPU as a solution. WebGPU is part of a new generation of graphics APIs that are more low-level and accommodate modern use cases and constraints. It aims to bring the capabilities of APIs like Vulkan, Metal, and DirectX 12 to the web.

Unlike WebGL, WebGPU introduces its own abstractions and doesn't directly mirror native APIs. This allows it to be more web-friendly and to sit on top of different native graphics APIs while abstracting their specific characteristics.

Overall, the author's goal is to make WebGPU accessible for web developers and share their learnings while exploring the API. They acknowledge that they may not cover every aspect of efficiency and performance but hope to provide a solid understanding of how to effectively use WebGPU.

The discussion on this post revolves around different aspects of WebGL and WebGPU, with various users sharing their experiences and opinions.

- One user shares their experience with WebGL and mentions that while it can be challenging to work with due to its design and the need to manage an internal global state object, WebGPU seems more comfortable and low-level for them. They clarify that they are not using WebGPU for generating graphics but for leveraging the GPU's computational capabilities.

- Another user suggests that off-topic technical articles should be immediately discarded to avoid wasting time on irrelevant knowledge. They mention the importance of documentation and publishing articles that focus on relevant topics.

- There is a discussion about different graphics APIs like OpenGL, Vulkan, D3D12, and Metal. Users highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each API and discuss their design principles and differences.

- Users express their concerns about the difficulties and challenges of working with WebGL and OpenGL. They mention issues with state sensitivity, unexpected behavior, and the need for careful state management.

- The limitations and complexities of working with GPU hardware are discussed. Users talk about hardware parallelism, scheduling, latency, memory transactions, and workgroup sizes in GPUs.

- One user asks for more articles and examples to help beginners get started with WebGPU, and other users share helpful links for learning and exploring the API.

- Finally, there is a mention of the legacy aspects of certain concepts in GPU programming, such as 2D data matrices and workgroup sizes. Users discuss the convenience and limitations of legacy shader handling and the differences between running shaders with different workgroup sizes.

Overall, the discussion provides insights into the challenges and benefits of using WebGL and WebGPU, as well as comparisons to other graphics APIs and discussions about hardware limitations and design principles.
