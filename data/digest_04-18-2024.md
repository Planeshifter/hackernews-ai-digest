#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/hermit) | 166 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40076848)

The latest project making waves on Hacker News is Hermit by Facebook Experimental. Hermit is a tool that launches Linux x86_64 programs in a special, hermetically isolated sandbox to control their execution. It focuses on translating normal, nondeterministic behavior into deterministic, repeatable behavior. This feature can be leveraged for a variety of applications, such as replay-debugging, reproducible artifacts, chaos mode concurrency testing, and bug analysis.

Hermit works by ensuring deterministic execution of arbitrary programs and acts as a reproducible container by isolating programs from sources of non-determinism like time, thread interleavings, and random number generation. While it cannot isolate programs from all sources of non-determinism such as file system changes or external network responses, users can provide a fixed file system base image and disable external networking to achieve complete determinism.

Despite Hermit being in maintenance mode and no longer under active development within Meta, it remains a powerful tool. Users can still contribute by submitting pull requests, with the team prioritizing merging these contributions. The tool intercepts system calls made by guest processes and can replace or sanitize those calls to ensure deterministic outcomes.

To try out Hermit, users can build it using Rust's cargo tool and run programs deterministically. Additional features like chaos mode for concurrency stress testing and replay-debugging are also available. The project provides example programs in its repository to showcase how Hermit can eliminate or control sources of nondeterminism in various scenarios.

Overall, Hermit offers a unique solution for ensuring deterministic and repeatable behavior in program execution, making it a valuable tool for developers seeking reproducibility and reliability in their applications.

The discussion on the submission about Hermit by Facebook Experimental on Hacker News covers various aspects of the project:

1. **Technical Details**: Users discuss how Hermit intercepts and modifies system calls to create a fully deterministic environment by eliminating sources of non-determinism like memory access, CPU instructions, and other environmental variables.

2. **Usage and Issues**: Some users share their experience with Hermit not working for non-trivial programs like Raft implementation and crashing with obscure error messages. The project seems to have limited support for certain features and has some performance impact due to system call interception.

3. **Comparison with Other Tools**: There is a comparison with other techniques like reversible debugging and deterministic record-replay work, such as seen in gdb, but Hermit provides a unique deterministic program execution environment.

4. **Performance Impact**: Concerns are raised about the performance impact of intercepting system calls, with comparisons made to other projects like Reverie which also faced performance issues due to heavy system call interception.

5. **General Discussion**: Users discuss how Hermit is similar to other deterministic testing services for reproducing bugs and how it relates to projects focusing on deterministic sandboxing and hypervisor-level device drivers support.

6. **Project Status**: It is noted that Hermit is no longer actively developed within Meta and lacks resources to fix major bugs or add new features.

7. **Differentiation from Containers**: Users highlight the difference between Hermit and traditional containers, stating that Hermit ensures programs run deterministically by controlling sources of non-determinism like thread scheduling.

Overall, the discussion provides insights into the technical aspects, usage challenges, comparisons with other tools, performance considerations, and the current status of the Hermit project.
