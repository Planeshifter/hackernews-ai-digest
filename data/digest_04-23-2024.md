#### [Submission URL](https://leanprover-community.github.io/con-nf//) | 322 points | by [namanyayg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=namanyayg) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40130924)

The project "New Foundations is consistent" involves the verification of the consistency of a set theory proposed by Quine in 1937 called "New Foundations" using an interactive theorem prover Lean. The proof of consistency, claimed by Randall Holmes since 2010, has been completed, with the theorem statements available in the repository. By constructing a model of a theory called Tangled Type Theory in Lean, the project proves that New Foundations is consistent. The project depends on mathlib, a mathematical library in Lean, for established results. The strategy involves constructing a model starting from a base type, with specific constructions at each type level and controlling the size of each type. The project culminates in the verification of the model's adherence to a finite axiomatization of the theory.

The discussion around the submission revolves around the verification of the consistency of the set theory "New Foundations" using the interactive theorem prover Lean. Some users express concerns about relying solely on the software for verifying mathematical conclusions, emphasizing the importance of human involvement in the process to ensure correctness. Additionally, there are debates on the trustworthiness of the language model and the potential risks associated with fully automated systems. Furthermore, there are discussions on the challenges of formalizing proofs and the significance of projects like this in the mathematics community. Users also draw parallels to other mathematical proofs and conjectures, highlighting the complexity and interpretability of different approaches. Overall, the discussion touches on the intersection of software verification, human oversight, and the advancement of mathematical research.
