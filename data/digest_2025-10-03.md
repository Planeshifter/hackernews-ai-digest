#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/jeff-bezos-ai-in-an-industrial-bubble-but-society-to-benefit.html) | 232 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [521 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464429)

Jeff Bezos: AI is in an ‚Äúindustrial bubble,‚Äù but the tech is real and will change every industry

- Speaking at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Bezos said today‚Äôs AI boom shows classic bubble signs: valuations detached from fundamentals and ‚Äúevery experiment or idea gets funded‚Äù ‚Äî even a six-person startup landing billions.
- He framed it as an industrial bubble, which he argues can be net-positive: like 1990s biotech, many firms will fail, but the surviving innovations can deliver outsized societal benefits.
- Key quote: ‚ÄúAI is real, and it is going to change every industry‚Ä¶ The benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic.‚Äù
- He‚Äôs not alone: Sam Altman has called AI bubbly; Goldman Sachs‚Äô David Solomon warned a reset/drawdown is likely; some investors say the ‚ÄúAI trade‚Äù resembles past speculative manias.
- HN angle: Expect froth, megafunding, and eventual shakeout. Builders with real moats and clear economics may outlast the hype; investors should separate durable tech from bubble noise.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Jeff Bezos's AI "Industrial Bubble" Comments**  

The Hacker News discussion revolves around Jeff Bezos‚Äôs assertion that AI is in an "industrial bubble" but will ultimately drive transformative societal benefits. Key themes include:  

1. **Dotcom Bubble Parallels**:  
   - Many commenters draw parallels between today‚Äôs AI boom and past tech bubbles (e.g., Dotcom, telecom), noting that infrastructure investments (e.g., fiber optics, chip manufacturing) often outlive the hype. However, concerns are raised about unsustainable spending on GPU-driven data centers and whether today‚Äôs AI experiments will yield durable value.  
   - Skeptics argue that AI‚Äôs reliance on centralized infrastructure (e.g., proprietary models from Google/Meta) could mirror the Dotcom era‚Äôs "platform capitalism," where tech giants extract rents as intermediaries. Others counter that decentralized, open-source LLMs might democratize access.  

2. **Social and Economic Impacts**:  
   - Technology‚Äôs "time-saving" benefits (e.g., online shopping, digital bureaucracy) are acknowledged, but critics highlight unintended consequences: social isolation, reduced face-to-face interaction, and challenges for non-digital-native populations (e.g., elderly struggling with complex systems).  
   - Wealth inequality and corporate control are recurring worries. Some argue AI could exacerbate these trends by concentrating power in firms with resources to train large models, while others see potential for innovation to uplift productivity in fields like healthcare or climate modeling.  

3. **Global Case Studies**:  
   - India‚Äôs telecom reforms and U.S. urban decay (e.g., San Francisco‚Äôs homelessness crisis) are cited as examples of how tech progress coexists with societal dysfunction. The discussion reflects broader anxieties about Western decline and the uneven distribution of tech‚Äôs benefits.  

4. **AI‚Äôs Practical Applications**:  
   - Optimists list promising use cases: weather prediction, drug discovery, low-cost gaming, and energy grid optimization. However, skeptics question whether current GPU investments in AI data centers are justified, given the speculative nature of many projects.  

5. **Debate Over Centralization**:  
   - A tension emerges between centralized AI systems (e.g., closed models from Big Tech) and decentralized alternatives. Some users warn that AI agents controlled by corporations could replicate the exploitative dynamics of social media algorithms, while others advocate for open-source models to prevent monopolistic control.  

**Conclusion**: While commenters generally agree with Bezos‚Äôs view that AI‚Äôs foundational technology is here to stay, the discussion reflects skepticism about the sustainability of current hype and funding. Infrastructure durability, equitable access, and avoiding past mistakes (e.g., unchecked corporate power) are emphasized as critical to realizing AI‚Äôs potential. The sentiment leans toward cautious optimism, tempered by lessons from history.

### **Comparisons & Alternatives**
- **Claude Code vs. Jules**: Users debate their strengths, with some switching to Claude Code for its scriptable API and perceived reliability. Others argue Jules‚Äô TUI and Gemini integration make it more polished for specific workflows.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Mentioned as a superior alternative for code generation, though Jules‚Äô focus on CI/CD automation differentiates it.

### **Broader Opinions on AI Coding**
- **Optimism**: Some believe AI agents will save significant time for repetitive tasks (e.g., dependency updates, test generation) and evolve into indispensable tools.
- **Skepticism**: Critics argue current LLMs lack domain-specific reliability, often produce "broken code," and risk disrupting functional systems. Concerns about AI replacing engineers are dismissed as premature, though automation of junior tasks is acknowledged.

### **Miscellaneous**
- **Naming Critiques**: Users mock the trend of anthropomorphized AI tool names (e.g., "Jules") as confusing or gimmicky.
- **Future Outlook**: Predictions range from AI agents becoming core devtools within 3 years to remaining niche aids requiring heavy oversight.

### Email was the user interface for the first AI recommendation engines

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/blog/ringo-email-as-an-ai-interface) | 77 points | by [coloneltcb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=coloneltcb) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45465392)

Before Spotify‚Äôs algorithms, the hottest ‚ÄúAI‚Äù music recommender ran on email. In 1994, thousands of people sent their favorite artists to a bot called Ringo and got back eerily on-point suggestions. It felt like artificial intelligence‚ÄîCory Doctorow later said ‚Äúhalf the music in my collection came out of Ringo‚Äù‚Äîbut under the hood it was simple social filtering: average the tastes of people who like what you like and redistribute the results.

The piece traces that lineage: MIT‚Äôs Paul Resnick (building on Thomas Malone) framed the core idea that ‚Äúpeople who agreed in the past are likely to agree again.‚Äù Xerox PARC‚Äôs Tapestry (1992) let readers ‚Äúendorse‚Äù messages so others could filter by trusted humans. Stanford‚Äôs SIFT (1994) brought it to the masses via the one universal UI everyone had then: email. In an era of exploding web content and scarce storage, human-in-the-loop signals‚Äîreads, replies, deletes‚Äîbecame the substrate for discovery.

Why it matters: Today‚Äôs recommendation engines and ‚ÄúAI‚Äù copilots still rest on that same collaborative-filtering spine. The 90s showed two enduring truths: email is a great distribution layer for new interfaces, and crowdsourced judgment can feel like intelligence long before the math gets fancy.

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the early AI recommender systems like Ringo and their legacy:

### Key Themes from the Discussion:
1. **Nostalgia & Simplicity**:  
   Users reminisced about early systems like **Gnoosic**, **Gnooks**, and **Gnovies**, which relied on basic collaborative filtering via email. Despite their simplicity, they often delivered eerily accurate recommendations (e.g., suggesting Procol Harum‚Äôs *A Whiter Shade of Pale*). Their interfaces were rudimentary but functional, relying on user corrections for typos (e.g., fixing "The Beatled" to "The Beatles").

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **Typos and Input Issues**: Users had to manually correct misspelled artist or song names (e.g., ABBA vs. ‚ÄúArgent‚Äù), highlighting the lack of auto-correction in early systems.  
   - **Email as Interface**: Before APIs, services like **TREARN** on Bitnet used email commands to process requests (e.g., `GET ftp://...`), trickling responses back in chunks.  

3. **Historical Context**:  
   - Early systems like **MORSE** (Movie Recommendation SystEm) and **Firefly** pioneered collaborative filtering. Firefly‚Äôs patent on the algorithm later sparked debates about ownership, especially after Microsoft acquired the tech. Users lamented how such foundational ideas weren‚Äôt monetized effectively by their creators.  
   - **Patents and Regrets**: A user shared regrets about not patenting their collaborative filtering algorithm, drawing parallels to today‚Äôs AI patent battles (e.g., ChatGPT‚Äôs rise vs. older systems).  

4. **AI vs. Statistics Debate**:  
   Some argued that collaborative filtering was more about **statistics** (e.g., averaging user preferences) than ‚Äútrue AI,‚Äù critiquing the article‚Äôs framing of it as groundbreaking AI. Others countered that its effectiveness at scaling human judgment made it revolutionary for its time.

5. **Impact and Legacy**:  
   Despite flaws, these systems shaped modern recommendation engines. Users praised services like **Gnoosic** for introducing them to niche artists (e.g., Melody Gardot, Hugh Masekela). The discussion also touched on how early email-based UIs laid groundwork for today‚Äôs notification-driven apps.

### Memorable Quotes:
- **On Simplicity**: *‚ÄúHalf my music collection came from Ringo‚Äù* (Cory Doctorow, referenced).  
- **On Legacy**: *‚ÄúMicrosoft kept the patent drawer closed‚Ä¶ today‚Äôs LLMs can‚Äôt math, but they‚Äôll sure patent it.‚Äù*  
- **On Patents**: *‚ÄúA single individual‚Äôs patent [5,749,081] sold barely‚Ä¶ now imagine that applied to the entire internet.‚Äù*

The thread blended admiration for these pioneering systems with critiques of their limitations and the broader implications for AI‚Äôs evolution.

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/17065099) | 43 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45468579)

Against the Uncritical Adoption of ‚ÄúAI‚Äù Technologies in Academia (preprint)

A multi-disciplinary group of academics urges universities to stop treating AI as a default add-on and start treating skepticism as a legitimate stance. They argue we‚Äôre repeating past tech mistakes (tobacco, combustion engines, social media) by rolling out AI tools without consent or debate‚Äîe.g., non-optional software updates and chatbots bundled into suites like Microsoft Office.

Key points:
- Core claim: Universities must actively counter vendor marketing and hype, scrutinize harms, and protect higher education‚Äôs core values‚Äîcritical thinking, expertise, academic freedom, and scientific integrity.
- Consent and choice: Staff and students often can‚Äôt opt out; rejecting AI tools is treated as invalid in teaching and research.
- Context: Expands a June 2025 Open Letter calling on institutions to reverse/rethink uncritical AI adoption; includes references for colleagues.
- Traction: Zenodo preprint (CC BY 4.0) has seen ~66.6k views and ~40.6k downloads within days.

Why HN cares: It hits perennial themes‚Äîproduct bundling, consent in software deployment, institutional governance, and the line between ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù and infrastructure capture.

Link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17065099

The Hacker News discussion on the preprint critiquing uncritical AI adoption in academia revolves around several key themes, blending substantive critiques with ideological debates:

1. **Historical Skepticism**:  
   Commenters reference past critiques of AI, such as the 1980s "AI winter" and works by philosophers like Hubert Dreyfus, highlighting long-standing ethical and technical doubts about AI. Mentions of 20th-century Marxist critiques and climate change parallels (e.g., inaction despite early warnings) underscore recurring patterns of institutional complacency.

2. **Political Ideologies**:  
   The thread devolves into debates about communism vs. capitalism, with some users dismissing terms like "communist" as Cold War-era propaganda. Others argue that critiques of AI are entangled with capitalist dynamics, citing historical atrocities (e.g., Belgian colonialism) to question whether technology‚Äôs harms stem from systemic exploitation rather than ideology.

3. **Academia‚Äôs Role**:  
   Participants debate whether scientists and institutions bear responsibility for resisting corporate-driven tech trends. Comparisons to climate change inaction suggest frustration with academia‚Äôs delayed response to societal threats. Some defend scientists as constrained by institutional pressures, not complacency.

4. **AI‚Äôs Practical Shortcomings**:  
   Users critique current AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT‚Äôs inaccuracies) as emblematic of overhyped, underperforming technology. Anecdotes about AI failures in research or teaching highlight concerns that deploying flawed tools without consent undermines academic integrity.

5. **Meta-Discussion on AI Summarization**:  
   Skepticism arises about using AI itself to parse the discussion, with users mocking ChatGPT‚Äôs potential to misinterpret nuanced debates or reproduce biases.

**Takeaway**: The conversation reflects broader tensions around trust in institutions, the ethical governance of technology, and AI‚Äôs societal impact. While some engage deeply with historical and philosophical contexts, others derail into ideological sparring, illustrating the polarized discourse surrounding AI adoption.

### Fp8 runs ~100 tflops faster when the kernel name has "cutlass" in it

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/pull/7298) | 333 points | by [mmastrac](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mmastrac) | [151 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458948)

Triton merges ‚Äúpersistent attention‚Äù tutorial/kernel, touts big low-context gains and strong FP8

The Triton team landed a sizable change set (93 commits) introducing a persistent-kernel rewrite of their attention tutorial (python/tutorials/gluon/01-attention-forward.py). Persistent kernels keep thread blocks resident on SMs to cut launch overhead and improve cache reuse‚Äîtypically a win at small/medium sequence lengths.

Highlights
- Performance: Author reports better throughput at low contexts after the rewrite. FP8 generally outpaces FP16 across tested shapes; e.g., with Z=4, H=32, D=128:
  - Non‚Äëcausal: FP16 roughly 0.72‚Äì1.06 ‚ÄúTFLOPs‚Äù vs FP8 ~0.71‚Äì1.52 as N_CTX scales 1K‚Üí65K
  - Causal: FP16 ~0.36‚Äì1.19 vs FP8 ~0.35‚Äì1.41
- Regressions: FP16 at large contexts took a hit due to a ptxas instruction scheduling quirk in the softmax partition. Expect follow-ups or workarounds.
- Quirky note: ‚ÄúFP8 is ~100 TFLOPs faster when the kernel name has ‚Äòcutlass‚Äô in it,‚Äù a tongue-in-cheek observation that hints at toolchain/profiler oddities.
- Baseline context: For posterity, the author shared pre-persistent results (including cuDNN FP16, which was ahead in many cases). Post-merge tables focus on Triton FP16/FP8; no new cuDNN comparison yet.
- Process: 93 commits spanning kernel tweaks and type-system internals (e.g., making aggregates mutable), with reviews approved and a lively thread reaction.

Why it matters: Persistent attention aligns Triton‚Äôs tutorial path with production-style kernels that shine at small batch/short sequence inference‚Äîcommon in real workloads. FP8 momentum continues, but FP16 long-context performance may need compiler or kernel-level fixes.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges and ethics of software/hardware optimizations, spurred by Triton‚Äôs merge of a "persistent attention" kernel. Key points include:

1. **Optimization Challenges**:  
   - Users note that compiler and GPU kernel optimizations (like those in Triton) are unpredictable, often yielding mixed results. Non-NVIDIA systems face particular difficulties due to opaque performance modeling.  
   - Historical frustrations with Java and C++ compilers are cited, where aggressive optimizations sometimes caused regressions or maintenance nightmares, leading to skepticism about relying on experimental flags.

2. **Ethical Concerns and Historical Scandals**:  
   - AMD/ATI‚Äôs past manipulation of *Quake III* benchmarks is highlighted: Renaming the executable (`quake3.exe` ‚Üí `quack.exe`) triggered driver optimizations, boosting benchmark scores at the cost of actual texture quality.  
   - Comparisons to Intel‚Äôs compiler controversy (favoring "GenuineIntel" CPUs) and Volkswagen‚Äôs emissions scandal underscore the fine line between optimization and deceit.  

3. **Vendor Practices**:  
   - NVIDIA‚Äôs driver-level tweaks (e.g., application-specific settings in its control panel) are discussed as both beneficial and contentious, blurring the line between optimization and "hijacking" rendering logic.  
   - Vulkan‚Äôs driver protocol is critiqued as fragile, enabling vendors to inject game-specific optimizations that risk breaking compatibility.

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Users debate the morality of prioritizing benchmarks over real-world performance, noting that while optimizations are necessary, they shouldn‚Äôt degrade user experience or transparency.  
   - The discussion reflects skepticism about "aggressive" optimizations (like Triton‚Äôs FP8 gains) if they sacrifice stability or rely on opaque, vendor-specific quirks.

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores the tension between performance gains and ethical engineering, advocating for optimizations that balance speed, transparency, and user trust.

### Microsoft CTO says he wants to swap most AMD and Nvidia GPUs for homemade chips

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html) | 183 points | by [fork-bomber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fork-bomber) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463642)

Microsoft wants to run mostly on its own chips long term, says CTO Kevin Scott. While Azure today relies heavily on Nvidia (and some AMD), Scott said Microsoft will ‚Äúentertain anything‚Äù for capacity now, but the goal is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù to use mainly Microsoft silicon in its data centers.

What‚Äôs new:
- Microsoft is already deploying its custom Azure Maia AI Accelerator (for AI) and Cobalt CPU, and is working on next-gen parts.
- It‚Äôs also rolling out ‚Äúmicrofluid‚Äù cooling to tackle thermals as power densities rise.
- Strategy shift is about whole-system design: silicon, networking, and cooling tuned to specific AI workloads.

Why it matters:
- Another strong signal that hyperscalers aim to reduce dependence on Nvidia/AMD and optimize cost/performance with in-house chips.
- Could pressure GPU pricing and margins over time, though near-term demand keeps Nvidia in pole position.

The bottleneck:
- Compute capacity remains the limiter. Scott called the shortage a ‚Äúmassive crunch,‚Äù saying even Microsoft‚Äôs most ambitious forecasts keep undershooting post-ChatGPT demand.
- Big Tech capex is set to top $300B this year, much of it for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft planning even more capacity in the coming years.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around Microsoft‚Äôs push for in-house AI chips and broader trends in custom silicon development among tech giants. Key themes and debates include:

### **1. Historical Context & Competing Approaches**
- **Google‚Äôs TPUs** are cited as an early example (2015) of hyperscalers developing custom AI accelerators. Users note TPUs evolved for both training and inference, with Broadcom and Marvell playing roles in their production. Some debate whether Google‚Äôs Gemini models rely entirely on TPUs or hybrid GPU/TPU setups for flexibility.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs Track Record**: Comments highlight past projects like *Project Brainwave* (FPGA-based AI acceleration) and Azure‚Äôs Catapult FPGA infrastructure. Skeptics question Microsoft‚Äôs credibility compared to Apple‚Äôs successful in-house silicon (e.g., M-series chips), while others defend Azure‚Äôs long-term hardware investments.

### **2. Technical Debates**
- **TPUs vs. GPUs**: A contentious thread argues whether TPUs are superior for training LLMs. Some claim Google uses TPUs for 99% of internal AI workloads, while others note GPUs remain critical for compatibility, rapid iteration, and frameworks like PyTorch. JAX/XLA‚Äôs role in Google‚Äôs software-hardware synergy is highlighted.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs MAIA Chip**: Users discuss the MAIA 100 (designed for transformers) and skepticism around its performance versus Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs. Some tie Microsoft‚Äôs urgency to its OpenAI partnership and the need to reduce reliance on Nvidia amid supply shortages.

### **3. Company Strategies**
- **Resource Shifts**: Microsoft‚Äôs reallocation of Xbox engineers to AI accelerators sparks discussion about prioritizing AI over gaming hardware. Critics question if this reflects a broader cultural shift.
- **Graphcore‚Äôs Failure**: Microsoft‚Äôs investment in Graphcore (a startup with specialized AI chips) is deemed a misstep, with users blaming high costs, limited software support, and Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. Graphcore‚Äôs large SRAM-focused design is seen as impractical for scaling.

### **4. Hardware Design & Innovation**
- **Custom Silicon Trends**: Comparisons to Apple‚Äôs PA Semi acquisition and TSMC‚Äôs role in enabling bespoke designs. Users debate whether hyperscalers‚Äô in-house chips will pressure Nvidia‚Äôs pricing or remain niche.
- **Analog & Subthreshold CMOS**: A tangent explores experimental analog ML accelerators and academic research into low-power designs, though most agree these are impractical for large models due to memory bottlenecks.

### **5. Market Implications**
- **Consumer Impact**: Some hope in-house chips will lower GPU prices for consumers, but others doubt it, noting hyperscalers‚Äô focus on cost-cutting, not consumer markets. Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúmoat‚Äù (CUDA ecosystem, Grace Hopper GPUs) is seen as durable despite competition.

### **Key Disagreements**
- **TPU Dominance**: Strong claims about Google‚Äôs internal TPU reliance clash with observations that GPUs are still needed for compatibility and rapid development.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs Credibility**: Divided opinions on whether Microsoft can replicate Apple‚Äôs silicon success or will struggle due to institutional inertia.
- **Nvidia‚Äôs Future**: While most agree Nvidia faces long-term pressure, near-term demand and software dominance (CUDA, PyTorch) are seen as insurmountable advantages.

Overall, the discussion underscores the strategic and technical complexities of shifting AI compute to custom silicon, with mixed optimism about its impact on innovation and market dynamics.

### Which Table Format Do LLMs Understand Best? (Results for 11 Formats)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.improvingagents.com/blog/best-input-data-format-for-llms) | 14 points | by [oidar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=oidar) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458455)

HN Digest: What table format do LLMs understand best?

TL;DR: Format matters a lot. In a head-to-head on 1,000-record tables and 1,000 lookup questions using GPT‚Äë4.1‚Äënano, a simple ‚Äúmarkdown key: value‚Äù (Markdown‚ÄëKV) layout beat CSV/JSONL by ~15‚Äì20 points in accuracy, but used ~2‚Äì3x more tokens. Expect a clear accuracy‚Äìcost tradeoff.

Study setup
- Data: 1,000 synthetic employee records, 8 fields each
- Task: 1,000 randomized, precise lookup questions (e.g., salary for a specific ID)
- Model: GPT‚Äë4.1‚Äënano
- Formats tested: 11 (CSV, JSONL, JSON, YAML, XML, HTML table, Markdown table, INI, pipe-delimited, natural language, Markdown‚ÄëKV)
- Single large chunk; no header repetition in tabular formats

Key results (accuracy; tokens in parentheses)
- Markdown‚ÄëKV: 60.7% (52,104)
- XML: 56.0% (76,114), INI: 55.7% (48,100), YAML: 54.7% (55,395)
- HTML: 53.6% (75,204), JSON: 52.3% (66,396), Markdown table: 51.9% (25,140)
- Natural language: 49.6% (43,411)
- JSONL: 45.0% (54,407), CSV: 44.3% (19,524), Pipe-delimited: 41.1% (43,098)

Takeaways
- Structure beats density: Explicit per-record ‚Äúkey: value‚Äù cues helped the model align fields, especially deep into long contexts.
- Tables degrade over distance: CSV/JSONL/pipe suffer when headers are far away; the authors did not repeat headers, which likely penalized these formats.
- You pay for accuracy: Top formats consumed ~2‚Äì3x tokens vs. CSV.
- Quick win: If you currently feed CSV/JSONL to an LLM for direct scanning, try KV-style blocks or richer tagging, or chunk with frequent header repetition.

Caveats
- Model is small (nano) and context-stressed; larger models or tool-assisted approaches (e.g., SQL execution) may narrow gaps.
- Synthetic data and simple lookup questions; different tasks (aggregations, joins, reasoning) could reorder the leaderboard.
- No chunking, no header repetition, and no few-shot parsing instructions‚Äîreal systems often do these and may boost tabular formats.

Practical guidance
- For direct LLM scanning: Use compact KV blocks with consistent short keys; one record per block; add strong delimiters; consider repeating mini-headers every N records if staying tabular.
- For RAG: Retrieve only relevant rows; keep headers close; avoid very wide tables; test Markdown‚ÄëKV vs. JSON/YAML on your own prompts.
- For production: Prefer tool use‚Äîhave the LLM generate a SQL/filter query and return the exact row(s) rather than reading raw tables.
- Always A/B on your data: Measure accuracy vs. token cost; small prompt tweaks (headers, delimiters, schema hints) can swing results.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

1. **Structure & Context Observations**  
   One user (abbreviated comment) suggested exploring XML with shorter element names or nested structures (e.g., functions/classes), hinting that tree-like formats or stricter schemas might help LLMs map data more effectively in limited-context scenarios.

2. **Surprise at Semantic Formats**  
   Another user noted unexpected results, as they anticipated traditional dictionary-like structures (JSON/XML) with inherent semantic context to outperform simpler formats like Markdown-KV.

3. **Interest in Model Comparisons**  
   A third commenter expressed curiosity about whether similar accuracy/cost tradeoffs exist across different LLM families (e.g., larger models like GPT-4 Turbo or Claude 3), implying performance could vary significantly by architecture.

**Key Themes**:  
Debate centers on how data structure (tree vs. flat, nested vs. explicit), model size, and semantic context interact‚Äîunderscoring that "best format" likely depends on task constraints and the LLM‚Äôs ability to infer relationships.
