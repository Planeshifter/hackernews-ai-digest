### Cold-blooded software

#### [Submission URL](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/) | 500 points | by [arbesman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbesman) | [198 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38793206)

In his blog post, "Cold-blooded software," Patrick Dubroy draws an interesting analogy between cold-blooded animals and software projects. He recounts a lecture where he learned about the remarkable ability of painted turtle hatchlings to survive being frozen. Just as cold-blooded animals adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them, Dubroy suggests that software projects should adopt a similar approach. He argues that warm-blooded projects, which thrive on constant motion and activity, are vulnerable to failure when frozen, akin to being put on hold for several months. In contrast, cold-blooded projects, like the baby painted turtle, can be frozen and easily picked back up without missing a beat. Dubroy emphasizes the importance of using "boring" technology in cold-blooded projects. By relying on vendored dependencies and avoiding external services that may change or disappear, he believes that software projects can remain resilient and functional for years to come. Dubroy shares the example of his own software project, a static site generator written in Python, which has remained intact and functional for twelve years. He concludes by saying that he fully expects it to continue working for another twelve years. The analogy and insights provided by Dubroy offer a unique perspective on the resilience and longevity of software projects.

The discussion on this submission involves various points regarding the longevity and stability of software projects. One commenter points out that Express, a popular JavaScript framework, has been running for 13 years and has served a large number of requests. They express contentment with using Express and state that it is good software overall. Another commenter adds that Express version 5 is expected to be released soon. A different commenter brings up Python and its ability to build resilient software. They mention that while Python 2 has reached its end of life, a Java 10-year-old code can still run in modern environments. This leads to a discussion about the differences between Python and Java and their approaches to backward compatibility. 

In response to this discussion, another commenter mentions that the Airflow project faced issues when renaming an operator, highlighting the complexities of maintaining software over time. They argue that Java is more cautious about making breaking changes compared to Python. The conversation shifts to the topic of build tools, with Maven being praised for its ability to handle large-scale dependencies. Others express their preference for Gradle or using Python's specific versioning for machine learning libraries. The discussion then touches on the challenges of managing dependencies in Python, with a suggestion to use tools like Poetry or conda to create virtual environments that work effectively. 

Lastly, there is a discussion about Python 3.11 and its release notes, which mention potential breaking changes and the removal of deprecated APIs. Some commenters argue that breaking changes in Python are limited and mainly involve removing deprecated APIs or semantics changes. Others mention specific examples of breaking changes they have encountered in different Python versions. 

Overall, the discussion delves into the considerations, challenges, and differences in maintaining and upgrading software projects.
