#### [Submission URL](https://verse.systems/blog/post/2024-03-09-using-llms-to-generate-fuzz-generators/) | 90 points | by [moyix](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moyix) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39653312)

Today's top story on Hacker News showcases the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating tasks that traditionally required significant human effort. Brendan Dolan-Gavitt's experiment using an LLM named Claude to generate a fuzzer for GIF parsing code is a shining example of this phenomenon. By providing Claude with the C code for a GIF parser, Brendan tasked the LLM with generating a Python implementation for a fuzzer to test the GIF parser. Surprisingly, Claude successfully produced a fuzzer that uncovered vulnerabilities in the GIF parser. Brendan later replicated this success with VRML files, further highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in automating complex processes like fuzzing.

While some may find this success unexpected, it can be attributed to the nature of fuzzing being inherently stochastic, making LLMs well-suited for generating input data that is "close enough" to expected input formats. Unlike static analysis, which requires precision, fuzzing thrives on generating semi-valid inputs that expose corner cases in a program. Brendan's experiment also raised questions about how well an LLM like Claude would perform with unknown input formats. To test this, a fictitious input format with seeded vulnerabilities was used, challenging Claude to generate a fuzzer for it. The results of this test shed light on the potential of LLMs in automated security testing for a variety of scenarios.

### Stylized image binning algorithm, for the web

#### [Submission URL](https://benjdd.com/posts/stylized-image-binning-algorithm/) | 38 points | by [bddicken](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bddicken) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39651677)

A new stylized image binning algorithm has been unleashed, merging photography, programming, the web, and coffee into a creative blend. This innovative tool uses a binning algorithm to transform images into pixel art masterpieces, all powered by Javascript and the canvas element. By adjusting the parameters binSize and binGap, users can control the size and spacing of the bins, ultimately creating a unique and stylized pixelated effect. The magic begins by dividing the input image into bins based on the chosen binSize. Smaller bins result in higher resolution but fewer brightness values for manipulation. The binGap parameter determines the spacing between each bin, adding a stylistic touch to the final product. Each bin is filled with a black square sized according to the average brightness of its pixels, creating a visually appealing pixelated look.

To bring this algorithm to life on the web, Javascript and canvas element are the weapons of choice. Despite the limitations of web-based image processing, the magic of pixel manipulation is made possible by extracting and modifying the RGB pixel data array from the canvas. Slide through the original and stylized versions with an interactive slider, thanks to the img-comparison-slider tool by Dimah Snisarenko.

The process is rounded off by setting up sliders, image loading functionalities, and custom Javascript functions to load images onto the canvases. The binning algorithm works its charm by retrieving pixel data, calculating bin sizes, and drawing black rectangles within each bin to forge the pixelated art style. Let your creativity flow by adjusting the parameters and uploading your images to experience the magic of this stylized image binning algorithm!

The discussion surrounding the submission includes comments on various topics. One user mentions that the stylized images from the algorithm remind them of posters from 20 years ago. Another user talks about printing half-tone images on a laser printer and experiencing issues with toning and fuzzy printing results. There is a conversation about whether printers are capable of printing patterns effectively, with suggestions to enhance black-and-white designs and switch to half-tone printing.
