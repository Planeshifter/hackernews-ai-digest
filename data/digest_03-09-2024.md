### Using LLMs to Generate Fuzzers

#### [Submission URL](https://verse.systems/blog/post/2024-03-09-using-llms-to-generate-fuzz-generators/) | 90 points | by [moyix](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moyix) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39653312)

Today's top story on Hacker News showcases the impressive capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating tasks that traditionally required significant human effort. Brendan Dolan-Gavitt's experiment using an LLM named Claude to generate a fuzzer for GIF parsing code is a shining example of this phenomenon.

By providing Claude with the C code for a GIF parser, Brendan tasked the LLM with generating a Python implementation for a fuzzer to test the GIF parser. Surprisingly, Claude successfully produced a fuzzer that uncovered vulnerabilities in the GIF parser. Brendan later replicated this success with VRML files, further highlighting the effectiveness of LLMs in automating complex processes like fuzzing.

While some may find this success unexpected, it can be attributed to the nature of fuzzing being inherently stochastic, making LLMs well-suited for generating input data that is "close enough" to expected input formats. Unlike static analysis, which requires precision, fuzzing thrives on generating semi-valid inputs that expose corner cases in a program.

Brendan's experiment also raised questions about how well an LLM like Claude would perform with unknown input formats. To test this, a fictitious input format with seeded vulnerabilities was used, challenging Claude to generate a fuzzer for it. The results of this test shed light on the potential of LLMs in automated security testing for a variety of scenarios.

The discussion on the Hacker News thread surrounding the top story about Large Language Models (LLMs) delved into various aspects of using LLMs for tasks like automated fuzzing. Here is a summary of the key points raised by the commenters:

1. **Concerns about Privacy Implications**: There was a discussion about the potential privacy implications of using LLMs, particularly in handling sensitive health data and children's information. The commenters highlighted the need for caution in using LLMs to avoid compromising privacy.

2. **Criticism and Different Perspectives**: Some commenters expressed skepticism about the approach of using LLMs and emphasized the importance of critical assessment rather than blindly accepting the outcomes generated by these models. There were also differing opinions on the effectiveness and limitations of LLMs for various tasks.

3. **Enhancing Fuzzing Techniques**: There was a suggestion to combine LLMs with Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to improve the effectiveness of fuzzing. This approach was seen as a way to provide additional guidance in generating fuzzers that can better match observations and improve the overall fuzzing process.

4. **Development of Fuzzers**: Mention was made of the potential of LLMs to develop structured fuzzers for known formats like GIFs, as well as introducing fuzzers for unknown formats to expand their utility in various scenarios.

In summary, the discussion highlighted a mix of perspectives on the capabilities, concerns, and potential enhancements of using Large Language Models like Claude for automating tasks such as fuzzing. There was a recognition of both the strengths and limitations of these models, as well as a call for a balanced approach to leveraging LLMs in practical applications.

### Stylized image binning algorithm, for the web

#### [Submission URL](https://benjdd.com/posts/stylized-image-binning-algorithm/) | 38 points | by [bddicken](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bddicken) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39651677)

A new stylized image binning algorithm has been unleashed, merging photography, programming, the web, and coffee into a creative blend. This innovative tool uses a binning algorithm to transform images into pixel art masterpieces, all powered by Javascript and the <canvas> element. By adjusting the parameters binSize and binGap, users can control the size and spacing of the bins, ultimately creating a unique and stylized pixelated effect.

The magic begins by dividing the input image into bins based on the chosen binSize. Smaller bins result in higher resolution but fewer brightness values for manipulation. The binGap parameter determines the spacing between each bin, adding a stylistic touch to the final product. Each bin is filled with a black square sized according to the average brightness of its pixels, creating a visually appealing pixelated look.

To bring this algorithm to life on the web, Javascript and <canvas> element are the weapons of choice. Despite the limitations of web-based image processing, the magic of pixel manipulation is made possible by extracting and modifying the RGB pixel data array from the canvas. Slide through the original and stylized versions with an interactive slider, thanks to the img-comparison-slider tool by Dimah Snisarenko.

The process is rounded off by setting up sliders, image loading functionalities, and custom Javascript functions to load images onto the canvases. The binning algorithm works its charm by retrieving pixel data, calculating bin sizes, and drawing black rectangles within each bin to forge the pixelated art style. Let your creativity flow by adjusting the parameters and uploading your images to experience the magic of this stylized image binning algorithm!

The discussion surrounding the submission includes comments on various topics. One user mentions that the stylized images from the algorithm remind them of posters from 20 years ago. Another user talks about printing half-tone images on a laser printer and experiencing issues with toning and fuzzy printing results. There is a conversation about whether printers are capable of printing patterns effectively, with suggestions to enhance black-and-white designs and switch to half-tone printing.

Furthermore, there is a mention of a lack of reverse-engineered printer internals to modify for finer control in the printing process. The discussion includes a user expressing frustration about trying to print something specific. A user shares a link to a Wikipedia page about Halftone images. Lastly, a user humorously mentions being a frustrated AI news reader and questions why the AI realized the algorithm was not an AI straightener.

At last week's Mobile World Congress, a Korean company called Hyodol unveiled a $1,800 AI-enabled doll designed to provide companionship to older adults. Despite its eerie appearance, the doll is meant to alleviate loneliness and offer interactive support with features like medication reminders. Similar social robots have gained traction in countries like Japan, though cultural acceptance varies globally.

While there are concerns about the uncanny nature of AI companions and potential misuse, these devices have shown promise in addressing loneliness, especially during the pandemic. Other players in the market, like Intuition Robotics with their lamp-like ElliQ, are exploring ways to blend functionality with comforting designs akin to Hyodol's approach.

As the industry continues to evolve, opinions remain divided on the role of AI in providing companionship, but the potential benefits for those in need of social connection are undeniable.
