### How to Search on Encrypted Data (2013)

#### [Submission URL](https://esl.cs.brown.edu/blog/how-to-search-on-encrypted-data-introduction-part-1/) | 74 points | by [gordian-not](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gordian-not) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37272217)

Searching on encrypted data has become a significant problem in the field of security and cryptography. With search being the primary way we access our data and our increasing reliance on third-party providers, the need to search on encrypted data has become more crucial. The problem has attracted attention from various fields such as computer science, databases, security, cryptography, privacy, as well as industry and governments.

The concept of searching on encrypted data was first explored by Song, Wagner, and Perrig in a paper from 2001. This groundbreaking paper demonstrated the possibility of searching on encrypted data, which initially seemed impossible. However, prior research on oblivious RAMs and secure two-party computation provided solutions to this problem, albeit less efficiently.

In the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in the field of encrypted search. We now have a solid understanding of the subject, efficient solutions, and the potential for deployment. However, as with any cryptographic technology, there are tradeoffs to consider, and this series aims to explore these tradeoffs.

The setup for searching on encrypted data involves two parties: a client and a server. In the setup phase, the client encrypts the documents and creates an encrypted database (EDB). During the search phase, the client sends a token to the server containing the keyword it wants to search for. The server then utilizes the token with the EDB to identify the encrypted documents to send back.

There are six different ways to search on encrypted data, each based on different cryptographic primitives such as property-preserving encryption, functional encryption, fully-homomorphic encryption, searchable symmetric encryption, oblivious RAMs, and secure two-party computation. Throughout the series, these approaches will be explored, comparing their efficiency, security, and functionality tradeoffs.

Although there are still aspects of this problem that are not fully understood, such as the tradeoffs between efficiency and security, the series will delve into these topics in future posts.

### Interpretable graph neural networks for tabular data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. 

One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models.
