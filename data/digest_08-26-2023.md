A recent blog post by Andrej Karpathy discusses the historical significance of the Yann LeCun et al. (1989) paper on handwritten zip code recognition. This paper is believed to be the earliest real-world application of a neural network trained end-to-end with backpropagation. Despite its age, the paper reads remarkably modern, covering topics such as dataset creation, neural network architecture, loss function, optimization, and reporting classification error rates. To explore the progress made in deep learning, Karpathy decided to reproduce the paper's results using PyTorch. He implemented the original network, which was written in Lisp, and successfully replicated the reported error rates. However, due to the loss of the original dataset, a simulated dataset based on MNIST had to be used. Karpathy also notes some ambiguities in the paper, such as the weight initialization scheme and the connectivity structure between layers. He concludes the post by reflecting on how much progress has been made in deep learning over the past 33 years and the potential for further improvement in the future.

### Interpretable graph neural networks for tabular data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models. Another user, "wstrnr," added that TabPFN (Transformers for Tabular Data) had similar performance to models like XGBoost, Catboost, LightGBM, KNN, SAINT, Reg Cocktail, Autogluon, and Auto-sklearn. They also noted the requirement of only 5 minutes to reach 20% ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) compared to TabPFN1. Additionally, they shared links to related papers such as "TabPFN Transformer Solves Small Tabular Classification Problems Second 2022" and "Interpretable Graph Neural Networks for Tabular Data Aug 2023".
