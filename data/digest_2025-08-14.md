### Why LLMs can't really build software

#### [Submission URL](https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software) | 766 points | by [srid](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=srid) | [439 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900116)

In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a hotly debated topic, especially regarding their ability to build and maintain software. A recent exploration dives into why LLMs, despite their prowess in code generation, fall short of functioning as full-fledged software engineers. The crux of the argument lies within the concept of mental models—an area where human engineers excel and LLMs falter.

Effective software engineers leverage their capability to build and refine mental models of both the requirements and the actual software behavior. This allows them to pinpoint discrepancies and decide whether adjustments in the code or requirements are necessary. In contrast, LLMs lack the ability to maintain and manipulate these coherent mental frameworks, leading to confusion, ineffective troubleshooting, and occasionally resorting to starting from scratch.

While LLMs show proficiency in generating code snippets, updating code based on clear issues, and even engaging in basic debugging and testing, their limitations become evident with more complex engineering tasks. They struggle with context omission, suffer from recency bias, and frequently fall prey to hallucinated information—all significant hurdles in forming accurate and useful mental models.

Despite these shortcomings, LLMs are undeniably valuable as tools that enhance the engineer's workflow. They excel in synthesizing documentation and generating straightforward code, acting as capable assistants rather than standalone creators. For now, human engineers must remain in the driver's seat, guiding and correcting the outputs while collaborating with these advanced models.

This article underscores the importance of complementing the strengths of LLMs with human oversight and expertise. Furthermore, it hints at a future where ongoing advancements might overcome current limitations, heralding a more integrated and capable collaboration between humans and AI in software development.

For those intrigued by these challenges and eager to shape the future of software development, Zed offers the opportunity to join their team—fostering innovation at the intersection of human and artificial intelligence.

The Hacker News discussion highlights skepticism about LLMs replacing human software engineers, despite their utility as tools. Key points include:

1. **Limitations in Context and Nuance**: LLMs struggle with ambiguous business rules, contextual understanding, and translating vague requirements into robust code. Human developers excel at interpreting fuzzy logic, identifying implicit assumptions, and collaborating with stakeholders.

2. **Debugging and Complex Problem-Solving**: While LLMs can generate code snippets, they falter at troubleshooting deeply nested errors, handling edge cases, and making judgment calls. Humans leverage mental models to diagnose issues holistically, whereas LLMs often resort to "regurgitating" code without true comprehension.

3. **Over-reliance Risks**: Commenters warn against blindly trusting LLM-generated code, comparing it to developers copy-pasting from forums without scrutiny. This could exacerbate poor practices, especially among junior developers.

4. **Human Judgment and Adaptation**: Critical tasks like negotiating project requirements, pushing back on unnecessary client changes, and balancing technical constraints with business needs remain firmly in the realm of human expertise. LLMs lack the agency to question flawed logic or propose non-technical solutions.

5. **Cautious Optimism**: Some acknowledge LLMs’ value in accelerating simple tasks (e.g., boilerplate code, documentation) and aiding prototyping. However, their role is seen as complementary—like a "code intern" needing supervision—not a replacement for skilled engineers.

**Consensus**: LLMs are powerful assistants but lack the contextual awareness, creativity, and critical thinking required for end-to-end software engineering. Human oversight remains irreplaceable, particularly for nuanced decision-making and maintaining system integrity. The discussion underscores a partnership model, where LLMs enhance productivity but do not supplant the developer’s role.

### Is chain-of-thought AI reasoning a mirage?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning/) | 183 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900340)

The paper you're frustrated with, "Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage?" from Arizona State University, has taken a divisive stand on how we perceive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. The authors argue that CoT reasoning, while appearing cohesive when applied to familiar data, falters under new, unfamiliar conditions or distribution shifts. They suggest that the models don't genuinely engage in logical reasoning but rather mimic learned patterns from their training data. This sparked your frustration, not just due to its conclusions, but because it seems to focus primarily on proving whether CoT constitutes "real" reasoning—an arguably pedestrian debate.

The study involved using a small transformer model (with about 600,000 parameters) trained on non-language data transformations, like simple alphabet puzzles. The findings indicated that when the model encountered unfamiliar task sequences or slight changes in format, its effectiveness declined. Even with fine-tuning, the results were limited to specific training data patterns, reinforcing the idea of pattern replication over true reasoning.

You offered several critiques of this conclusion. Firstly, reasoning in AI should likely require language use akin to human-style introspections, involving more complex decision-making processes and capabilities than the toy problem suggests. Secondly, you argued that the model used is too small to draw broader conclusions, as true reasoning skills are believed to emerge in much larger models. Lastly, the paper fails to align its findings with human reasoning, which naturally involves speculative, flexible thought processes, often marked by reconsideration and self-correction—an aspect not sufficiently captured by the study.

In essence, while the paper claims to expose reasoning as a façade in AI, your perspective is that its scope and methodology are insufficient to support such sweeping assertions. Reasoning in AI must be tested through more sophisticated and human-like tasks, potentially with significantly larger models, to truly understand its capabilities.

**Summary of the Discussion on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning in LLMs:**

The debate centers on whether CoT reasoning in LLMs represents genuine logical reasoning or is merely an illusion of pattern mimicry. Key arguments include:

1. **CoT as Pattern Mimicry vs. Reasoning**:  
   Critics argue LLMs replicate learned patterns rather than engage in true reasoning. For example, fine-tuned models perform well on familiar tasks but struggle with novel formats or distribution shifts, suggesting reliance on memorization. Some liken CoT to stylistic narrative generation ("film noir twists") rather than structured logic.

2. **Role of Language and Symbolic Logic**:  
   A philosophical divide exists over whether reasoning requires language. Proponents of symbolic approaches (e.g., DeepMind’s AlphaProof/AlphaGeometry) advocate hybrid systems combining neural networks with formal logic. Critics counter that LLMs inherently lack deterministic reasoning, as their outputs are probabilistic and context-dependent.

3. **Human vs. LLM Reasoning**:  
   Human reasoning is highlighted as involving emotion, uncertainty navigation, and incremental learning—traits absent in LLMs. While humans refine predictions through sensory feedback and curiosity, LLMs are constrained by pre-training and lack "in-the-world" experiential learning. Some argue CoT steps are merely token predictions optimized for plausibility, not truth.

4. **Technical Limitations and Progress**:  
   Smaller models’ failures under distribution shifts are noted, but proponents stress that larger models (e.g., Gemini) show emergent reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and verified reasoning steps in training data can improve CoT’s reliability, though skeptics view this as narrow optimization rather than general reasoning.

5. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**:  
   The discussion questions definitions of "real reasoning" and whether LLMs’ utility matters more than philosophical purity. While some dismiss the debate as irrelevant (focusing on practical results), others emphasize the need for architectures supporting lifelong learning and cognitive traits like working memory.

**Takeaway**: The debate remains unresolved, balancing skepticism about LLMs’ current reasoning depth with optimism about hybrid approaches and scaling. CoT’s value lies in its practical utility, even if it falls short of human-like reasoning.
