### JIT WireGuard

#### [Submission URL](https://fly.io/blog/jit-wireguard-peers/) | 469 points | by [Lwrless](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Lwrless) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39688545)

The team at Fly.io has been working on optimizing WireGuard for their containers, implementing new tricks to make it faster and more scalable for their growing user base. In a recent blog post, they discuss their approach of dynamically creating WireGuard peer configurations for communication between their CLI tool (flyctl) and Fly Machines. Until recently, their gateways operated on a simple system where WireGuard connections were established through a background agent process. However, they encountered two main issues: unreliable message delivery with NATS and leftover WireGuard peers causing slow operations and kernel panics.

To address these challenges, Fly.io devised a solution where gateways now pull peer configurations on demand from their API, enabling them to add peers to the kernel only when needed. They leveraged a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach to manage WireGuard peers efficiently by intercepting connection requests using BPF filters and packet sockets. By implementing this design, Fly.io aims to streamline their WireGuard operations and enhance the overall performance of their network.
