### AI does not help programmers

#### [Submission URL](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/273577-ai-does-not-help-programmers/fulltext) | 86 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36202543)

In a recent blog post on Communications of the ACM, Bertrand Meyer discusses the limitations of AI when it comes to programming. While many people have touted AI as the future of programming, Meyer argues that the technology is still far too fallible and unreliable to replace human programmers. He notes that while AI may be able to generate convincing results quickly, it can never guarantee the correctness of a program. Ultimately, Meyer concludes that AI tools can be useful in many areas, but programming is not one of them.

Bertrand Meyer's recent article on Communications of the ACM, which argues against using AI in programming due to its lack of reliability and inability to guarantee correctness, sparked a discussion on Hacker News. Many users shared their experiences using AI programming tools like Github Copilot and ChatGPT. Some users found the tools greatly helpful for quick testing and implementation, while others pointed out their limitations and occasional failures. Some users stressed the importance of learning programming fundamentals and criticized over-reliance on AI tools. Other users discussed the potential ethical implications of relying solely on AI-generated code. Overall, the discussion highlights the pros and cons of AI programming tools and raises interesting questions about the future of programming.

### Paralyzed man walks naturally, thanks to wireless bridge between brain and spine

#### [Submission URL](https://www.science.org/content/article/paralyzed-man-walks-naturally-thanks-wireless-bridge-brain-spine) | 39 points | by [semihsalihoglu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=semihsalihoglu) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36192576)

A Dutch man who lost his ability to walk after a spinal cord injury in 2011 can now walk more fluidly following a procedure to connect his brain and lower body. Scientists implanted an array of electrodes on top of the spinal cord to stimulate nerve function, and then signal brain thoughts to the spinal stimulator, facilitating the movement. The latest approach combines two already established procedures, spinal stimulation and brain interfaces in a new way. After 40 training sessions, the patient can walk, stand and climb staircases and, even when the devices are turned off, the benefits appear to persist, with one researcher suggesting it could be "a huge step forward".

The discussion is largely focused on the technology used for the procedure and its potential future applications. One user mentions another similar approach that involved capturing signals from the brain to control a cursor on a screen. Another user comments on the impressive nature of the implant and how it can manipulate muscles. There is also a discussion of a hypothetical startup that offers a service to permanently connect the spinal cord to a virtual desk and gym for fitness purposes.

Google Cloud has launched a new learning path focused on Generative AI, which aims to provide users with a curated collection of content to learn everything from the basics of large language models to how to create and deploy generative AI solutions using the Google Cloud platform. The learning path is managed by Google Cloud and includes 10 distinct learning activities. It was last updated just two days ago, indicating that the content is up-to-date and relevant to current industry trends.

Google Cloud has launched a new learning path for Generative AI that includes ten learning activities. As per the discussion, people tend to have mixed feelings about the actual usefulness of the program, with some users stating that they have had issues with Qwiklabs and are yet to complete the training. Others provided helpful resources on AI learning, and some users criticized Google for its compliance and integration practices with other companies. There were comments about the difficulty of navigating Google's certification program and the high cost of resources required for labs. The discussion also touched on the accessible language used in the program and the skepticism around corporate speak. The comments also branched out into broader topics such as corporate ethics, and contributions made by Facebook, Google, and Apple towards AI research.

### Stack Overflow Moderators Striking to Stop Garbage AI Content from Flooding Site

#### [Submission URL](https://www.vice.com/en/article/4a33dj/stack-overflow-moderators-are-striking-to-stop-garbage-ai-content-from-flooding-the-site) | 41 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36205043)

Volunteer moderators at Stack Overflow have gone on strike over the company’s new AI content policy, which they say will allow for the proliferation of false information on the site. The policy, implemented in May, allows for all GPT-generated content and prohibits moderators from moderating AI-generated content simply for being AI-generated. The moderators claim that AI chatbots like ChatGPT do not understand the information they provide and that allowing unfettered access to this content threatens the quality and accuracy of Stack Exchange’s information. They are also demanding greater transparency from the site’s owners, Stack Overflow, Inc.

Some commenters argue for increasing the use of AI-generated content, while others argue that the focus should be on improving moderation and verification processes rather than relying on AI-generated content. Some suggest that paid services may help alleviate some of the moderation issues. There is also discussion around the importance of verifying the accuracy of AI-generated content and the difficulty in detecting and preventing spamming.

### A prompt pattern catalog to enhance prompt engineering with ChatGPT

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11382) | 124 points | by [aliparlakci](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aliparlakci) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36196113)

Researchers have created a catalog of prompt engineering techniques presented in pattern-form that can be applied to improve conversations with large language models such as ChatGPT. Prompts enforce rules, automate processes, and ensure specific qualities of generated output, and can be thought of as a form of programming that customizes output and interaction with LLMs. The prompt pattern catalog provides a framework for documenting patterns for structuring prompts to solve common problems faced when conversing with LLMs. The research provides a catalog of prompt patterns that have been applied successfully to improve the outputs of LLM conversations and demonstrates how prompts can be built from multiple patterns. This research is expected to be particularly useful in automating software development tasks. The discussion includes links to related research papers and tutorials, as well as different perspectives on the term "prompt engineering," with some commenters arguing that the term is misleading or not applicable in certain contexts.

### Microsoft Kills Cortana in Windows

#### [Submission URL](https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-11/283998/microsoft-kills-cortana-in-windows) | 27 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36199882)

Microsoft has announced that it will no longer support its AI assistant, Cortana, as a standalone app on both Windows 10 and 11 starting from late 2023. The focus will now be on leveraging AI capabilities embedded in Edge and Windows instead. In 2019, the CEO of the tech giant acknowledged that Cortana would never be on par with Alexa or Google Assistant. Since then, the app has been gradually phased out, with Microsoft officially ending support for its Cortana app on Android and iOS earlier this year. Microsoft Copilot branding will instead take center stage as the new AI wave takes over Windows and beyond.

The discussion on the submission revolves around Microsoft's history of introducing new and hyped-up products that are later discontinued. Some users mention cases such as the Windows Phone as an example. Some commenters criticize Microsoft's focus on launching a new AI character rather than improving Cortana. Others express their relief that the outdated app will be phased out, while some users humorously suggest the return of an old Microsoft character like Clippy.
