#### [Submission URL](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/07/generative-ai-space-and-the-mental-imagery-of-alien-minds/) | 244 points | by [RafelMri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RafelMri) | [106 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36767837)

In a recent post on his blog, Stephen Wolfram explores the concept of alien minds and how artificial intelligence (AI) can help us understand them. Wolfram explains that AIs are essentially accessible forms of alien minds because they are not aligned with human thought processes. To capture the "mental imagery" of an alien AI, Wolfram suggests modifying a generative AI by resetting weights in its neural net. This "alien" neural net still produces images, but they become increasingly different from human perception as the neural net is modified. By studying these progressively alien images, Wolfram believes that we can gain insight into the worlds of different and alien minds. Additionally, Wolfram explains how AIs are trained to generate images by capturing the regularities found in billions of images from the web. These "random images" exhibit the statistical patterns of the training data and can show recognizable objects or scenes. Overall, Wolfram's exploration of alien minds and generative AI provides a fascinating perspective on perception and cognition.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the concept of AI-generated images and how they relate to human perception. Some comments touch on the similarities and differences between AI dream-like images and human dreams. Other comments discuss the technical aspects of AI-generated images and how they can be seen as artistic expression. Some users also express concerns about the role of AI in generating content and its impact on traditional art forms. Overall, the discussion explores the potential of AI to produce novel and intriguing imagery, while also raising questions about its limitations and implications.

### A Theory on Adam Instability in Large-Scale Machine Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871) | 135 points | by [vov_or](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vov_or) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36771484)

A new theory has emerged in the field of machine learning that explains the previously unexplained divergent behavior observed in the training of large language models. The theory suggests that the phenomenon is due to the optimization algorithm used for training, called Adam. The researchers argue that Adam can reach a state where the parameter update vector has a large norm and is uncorrelated with the direction of descent on the training loss landscape, leading to divergence. This behavior is more likely to occur in the training of deep models with large batch sizes, which is common in large-scale language model training. The theory is supported by observations from training runs of language models with varying scales. The paper, titled "A Theory on Adam Instability in Large-Scale Machine Learning," is authored by Igor Molybog and 16 other researchers. It is available for download on arXiv.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the new theory proposed by the researchers regarding the divergence in training large language models due to the use of the Adam optimization algorithm. Some users suggest trying different techniques such as controlling the term of the gradient or restarting the training process to mitigate the issue. Others discuss the potential of using CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and other optimization methods for better results. There are also discussions on the limitations of gradient-based optimization methods and the challenges faced in finding global minima. Some users mention the possibility of using swarm optimization and genetic algorithms to improve the search process. One user points out the importance of local minima and the difference between biological neural networks and machine learning models. The energy costs of training models and the efficiency of neural networks compared to humans are also discussed in the comments.

### AI: Startup vs Incumbent Value (2022)

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/ai-startup-vs-incumbent-value) | 78 points | by [tristanMatthias](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tristanMatthias) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36767452)

In a recent blog post, Elad Gil examines the distribution of value, revenue, and success between startups and incumbents in different technology waves. He notes that in the first internet wave, startups like Google and Amazon captured the majority of the value, while incumbents like Microsoft and Apple extended their franchises onto the internet. In the mobile wave, incumbents like Apple and Google dominated, but startups like Whatsapp and Uber still had significant success. However, in the prior wave of AI, most of the value went to incumbents like Google, Facebook, and Amazon, with few successful AI startups emerging. Gil puts forward several hypotheses for why this happened, including the possibility that prior AI products were not dramatically better than incumbents' offerings or that data differentiation was more important at that time. He also suggests that the difficulty of competing in hard markets or against incumbents may have played a role. Looking ahead, Gil believes that the current wave of AI, with its focus on unsupervised learning, will see strong success for startups in addition to incumbent value.

The discussion on this submission covers several aspects related to AI and startups. 

One user mentions a system called Interactive-LLM-Powered-NPCs, which allows talking NPCs in video games. They discuss how this system uses Python code components to enable speech-to-text conversion, facial expression recognition, game message determination, and more.

Another user argues that living history experiences in video games are more immersive and enjoyable when non-player characters (NPCs) can engage in meaningful conversations. They mention the use of Markov chains in generating NPC dialogue and highlight the difference between traditional video games and massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) in terms of immersive storytelling.

The conversation then shifts to the distribution of value between startups and incumbents in different technology waves. It is noted that in prior AI waves, incumbents like Google, Facebook, and Amazon captured most of the value, with few successful AI startups emerging. Several hypotheses are presented, including the possibility that previous AI products were not significantly better than existing offerings or that data differentiation was more critical at the time. The difficulty of competing in hard markets or against incumbents is also mentioned.

The discussion also touches on the importance of data in AI work and the challenges that startups face in obtaining large amounts of high-quality data. The role of AI in various industries, such as enterprise domains, is mentioned.

There is a brief comment about the financial profitability of OpenAI, with one user mentioning the estimated costs and potential revenue streams for the company.

### A Latent Space Theory for Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09960) | 14 points | by [rileyphone](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rileyphone) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36776920)

The paper titled "A Latent Space Theory for Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models" by Hui Jiang explores the relationship between languages and their underlying meanings. The study categorizes languages as unambiguous or epsilon-ambiguous and demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can exhibit emergent abilities, such as language understanding, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and effective instruction fine-tuning, through Bayesian inference on the sparse joint distribution of languages. This paper presents quantitative results and sheds light on the capabilities of LLMs in language processing.

The discussion around the submission focuses on the structure and analysis of languages. One user argues that languages are created randomly for specific purposes and convey information through distinct and independent units such as sentences or programming languages. Another user adds that language messages represent intended meanings in a space, where different intentions constitute distinct regions and simple intentions are represented by elements in a finite set. They suggest that the study of language should consider discrete countable assumptions. 

In response, another user provides research that supports the effectiveness of transformer-based language models. They share two articles that discuss the reasonable effectiveness of these models. 

However, one user disagrees with the assumption that language messages contain intentions recursively in a fundamental space of meaning. They argue that this approach to studying language is oversimplified and may not fully capture the complexity of the field. 

Finally, a user points out that the discussion seems to lack an interdisciplinary perspective and suggests that siloing of perspectives may prevent a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/rekor-ai-system-analyzes-driving-patterns-criminals-1850647270) | 30 points | by [HiroProtagonist](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=HiroProtagonist) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36772253)

In a recent case in New York, police were able to identify and arrest a drug trafficker with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). The police used the services of a company called Rekor, which analyzes traffic patterns and identifies suspicious behavior. Rekor's software sifts through a large database of information collected from regional roadways by the county's automatic license plate recognition system. By recording and analyzing vehicle trajectories, the software can determine whether certain routes are suspicious or not. In this case, the AI algorithm determined that the driver's routes were consistent with those of a drug trafficker, leading to his arrest. This highlights how AI is being used to enhance surveillance systems and aid law enforcement. However, there are concerns about the potential misuse of this technology and the need for appropriate regulations to prevent abuse.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the pros and cons of AI-assisted surveillance systems and their potential misuse. 

One user points out that the AI algorithm used in this case reminds them of the controversy surrounding the analysis of phone data, where innocent activities were mistakenly flagged as suspicious. Another user jokingly suggests that the investigation could have been prompted by Tupperware parties, emphasizing that false positives can occur.

Some users express concerns about the potential for targeted searches in minority neighborhoods and the erosion of privacy. Others argue that AI-based investigations can be helpful in fighting crime, but there needs to be clear regulations in place to prevent abuse. The discussion also touches on the limitations of AI systems and their potential for false positives.

One user brings up the issue of law enforcement accessing location records without a warrant, while another user notes the historical use of AI systems to combat terrorism and drug dealers. There is a debate about the balance between privacy and security, with some arguing that surveillance technology is necessary to target criminals while others feel it infringes on civil liberties.

One user points out the decline in public trust in AI and the surveillance state, while another user suggests that the focus should be on legislation to address the problem. Finally, there is a mention of the shift in public attention towards other pressing issues such as domestic terrorism, child trafficking, and party affiliations.
