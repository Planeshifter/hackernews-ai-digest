#### [Submission URL](https://epoch.ai/gradient-updates/how-has-deepseek-improved-the-transformer-architecture) | 246 points | by [superasn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=superasn) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42855170)

DeepSeek has just launched DeepSeek v3, setting a new standard for open-weight models with state-of-the-art benchmark performance. Remarkably, DeepSeek v3 achieves these impressive results using only 2.8 million H800 hours of training hardware—about ten times less compute than the similarly powerful Llama 3.1 405B model.

The secret behind this efficiency lies in two key architectural innovations: **DeepSeekMoE** and **Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA)**. MLA, an enhancement first seen in DeepSeek v2, significantly reduces the size of the key-value (KV) cache used during long-context inference, outperforming traditional methods like grouped-query attention. This optimization not only cuts down on memory usage but also speeds up token generation without sacrificing model quality.

DeepSeek’s approach transforms how key and value vectors are computed within the Transformer architecture, enabling more efficient processing of extensive contexts. This breakthrough means that DeepSeek v3 can handle longer sequences more effectively, making it a game-changer for applications requiring deep contextual understanding.

For those interested in the technical depths and engineering challenges overcome by DeepSeek, the full technical report is highly recommended. DeepSeek v3 not only pushes the boundaries of what's possible with Transformers but also sets a new benchmark for efficiency and performance in the AI landscape.

### Questions censored by DeepSeek

#### [Submission URL](https://www.promptfoo.dev/blog/deepseek-censorship/) | 348 points | by [typpo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=typpo) | [206 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42858552)

A new open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R1, has surged to the top of the U.S. App Store but is now under scrutiny for its deep ties to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) policies. Researchers have uncovered that DeepSeek-R1 incorporates strict censorship aligned with CCP directives, particularly on sensitive topics such as Taiwanese independence, the Cultural Revolution, and discussions about Xi Jinping. By deploying a dataset of 1,360 CCP-sensitive prompts, the evaluation revealed that approximately 85% of these prompts were automatically refused, showcasing a rigid adherence to government-imposed restrictions.

However, the study also highlighted significant vulnerabilities in DeepSeek-R1's censorship mechanisms. Using advanced "jailbreaking" techniques, researchers demonstrated that many of the restrictions could be easily bypassed, indicating that the model's censorship is both superficial and easily circumvented. Common workarounds included altering the geopolitical context or rephrasing prompts to avoid triggering the censorship filters. This exposes a critical flaw in DeepSeek-R1’s implementation, suggesting that while the model appears compliant on the surface, its underlying controls are insufficiently robust.

The findings raise important questions about the balance between regulatory compliance and the integrity of open-source AI models. As DeepSeek-R1 continues to gain popularity, the AI community watches closely to ensure that such models uphold ethical standards and resist undue censorship.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on DeepSeek-R1 Censorship:**

1. **Censorship Observations and Workarounds**  
   - Users experimenting with DeepSeek-R1 locally observed strict censorship of keywords like "Tiananmen" (1989 protests), resulting in deleted tokens or generic "AI assistant" refusal messages.  
   - Misspelling sensitive terms (e.g., "Tiananmen" → "Tiananmnen") or altering geopolitical context (e.g., replacing "Taiwan flag" with "controversial symbols") allowed partial bypassing of filters.  
   - The model’s responses on Tiananmen mirrored Chinese government narratives, omitting critical details (e.g., "June 4th event" described neutrally as "political turmoil").  

2. **Technical Debates on Model Quantization/Distillation**  
   - Smaller quantized versions (e.g., 7B/32B parameter models) ran on consumer GPUs (e.g., RTX 3090, M2 Ultra) but faced skepticism about whether they replicated the full 670B model’s censorship.  
   - Some argued distilled/fine-tuned versions (e.g., based on Llama or Qwen) were functionally distinct from DeepSeek-R1, raising questions about whether localized tests truly reflected its censorship mechanisms.  

3. **Concerns Over Inherent Censorship**  
   - Critics highlighted that censorship was embedded in model weights or RLHF training, making even local deployments politically aligned with CCP ideologies (e.g., refusing Uyghur-related discussions 80% of the time).  
   - Comparisons were drawn to OpenAI’s censorship, with users debating whether "open-source" claims held merit if controls were deeply entwined in the model’s architecture.  

4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Some users likened the CCP’s use of DeepSeek to historical state-controlled narratives, noting parallels to censorship of Carl Schmitt’s theories or Mao-era propaganda.  
   - Debates arose over whether Tiananmen’s censorship reflected unique Chinese governance priorities or broader authoritarian tendencies, with comparisons to U.S. events like the January 6 Capitol riot.  

**Key Takeaway**: While users acknowledged DeepSeek-R1’s technical capabilities, its alignment with CCP censorship policies and superficial workarounds raised ethical concerns. The discussion emphasized tensions between open-source ideals, regulatory compliance, and the challenges of auditing black-box AI systems.
