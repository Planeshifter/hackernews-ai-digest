#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/time-saved-by-ai-offset-by-new-work-created-study-suggests/) | 411 points | by [amichail](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amichail) | [394 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43878850)

In a new study dissecting the 2023–2024 Danish labor market, economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen reveal that despite the rapid adoption of generative AI models like ChatGPT in numerous workplaces, these tools have not yet significantly affected wages or employment. Published in the working paper "Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects," researchers Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard examined the impact of AI chatbots across 11 automation-prone occupations such as accountants and software developers. Their extensive analysis of data from 25,000 workers across 7,000 workplaces found no substantial changes in earnings or work hours due to chatbot technology.

Interestingly, while AI chatbots have quickly become commonplace—with 64 to 90 percent of workers in the relevant sectors adopting them—actual productivity benefits appear limited. Workers reported an average time saving of just 2.8 percent, roughly an hour per week. Surprisingly, for some employees, AI tools even created new tasks, neutralizing potential efficiencies. The study also highlighted that merely 3 to 7 percent of any productivity gains enhanced worker earnings.

The researchers acknowledge that this study captures only the early phase of AI deployment and may not reflect future implications as integration deepens. While these findings cast doubt on immediate, sweeping labor market changes due to AI, they open the floor for further discourse and studies on the long-term economic impact of generative AI as the technology and its applications evolve.

Simultaneously, Benj Edwards from Ars Technica highlights this study's importance, pointing out how it both tempers current narratives of AI-driven job market transformation and sets the stage for continued research into this rapidly advancing sector. Keep an eye on future developments as they unfold in the world of AI.

The discussion around the study on AI's impact on Denmark's labor market reveals a mix of skepticism, real-world anecdotes, and debates about AI's limitations and future potential. Key themes include:

1. **Skepticism of Overhyped Claims**: Users compare the study to past automation fears (e.g., junior roles in law), noting that AI tools, while adopted widely, often fall short of transformative promises. Examples include customer service chatbots struggling with complex issues (e.g., Klarna’s initial AI shift and subsequent rehiring of humans) and inflated corporate narratives about efficiency gains.

2. **AI’s Practical Limitations**: Participants shared frustrations with AI in customer service (e.g., broken airline booking systems, utility providers) where bots failed to resolve issues, necessitating human intervention. While AI handles routine tasks (40% of requests in some cases), users highlight its inability to manage nuanced problems, leading to workflow friction.

3. **Shifting Job Dynamics**: Some argue AI redistributes work rather than eliminating jobs—freeing humans for harder tasks but also increasing job complexity. Zuckerberg’s claim that AI allows call centers to tackle tougher issues was critiqued, with users noting systemic bloat and managerial challenges in large corporations (e.g., Meta’s headcount debates).

4. **Corporate Realities vs. Promises**: Critiques of corporate governance emerged, questioning whether AI adoption is driven by genuine efficiency or cost-cutting amid mismanagement. Comments highlighted how companies may overstate AI’s benefits while underinvesting in user experience or employee support.

5. **Long-Term Uncertainty**: While the study found minimal current labor market impact, users debated whether this is a "frontier" phase, with future AI advancements potentially disrupting jobs more profoundly. Others stressed caution, emphasizing AI’s incremental role rather than revolutionary change.

In sum, the discussion aligns with the study’s conclusions: AI adoption is real but nuanced, with limited immediate effects on wages or employment. Skepticism persists about current capabilities, and the consensus leans toward AI as a tool that reshapes work rather than replaces it outright—for now.

A groundbreaking position paper from arXiv proposes a bold shift in the AI research landscape, challenging the community to stop treating the elusive "Artificial General Intelligence" (AGI) as its ultimate objective. Penned by a team of 16 experts, including Borhane Blili-Hamelin and Christopher Graziul, the paper argues that the current AGI-centric focus is obstructing the ability to set achievable and meaningful goals within the field. The authors identify six significant "traps" inherent in the AGI discourse, such as the "Illusion of Consensus" and "Supercharging Bad Science," which they believe hinder progress.

To combat these issues, the paper advocates for a fresh direction by urging researchers to prioritize specific, diverse goals and embrace contributions from various disciplines and communities. This approach could pave the way for more inclusive and innovative AI advancements that better address societal needs. By rethinking the trajectory of AI research, the authors hope to inspire a more productive and pluralistic approach that moves beyond the monolithic goal of AGI, promising a future of enriched scientific and societal impact.

The Hacker News discussion on the AGI critique paper reveals a multifaceted debate with several key themes:

1. **AGI as Marketing vs. Science**  
   Many commenters criticize AGI as a vague, overhyped concept driven more by corporate marketing (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) and VC funding than scientific rigor. Comparisons are drawn to "religious beliefs" or "magical thinking," with skepticism toward claims that LLMs represent steps toward AGI. Critics argue the term distracts from practical AI applications and enables "bad science."

2. **LLMs and Cognitive Understanding**  
   A thread debates whether LLMs help illuminate human cognition. Some compare AI models to aerodynamics studying birds—useful engineering tools without replicating biology. Others counter that LLMs’ "black box" nature and corporate secrecy (e.g., training data/methods) limit their scientific value for understanding intelligence. Chomsky’s language acquisition theories are invoked, questioning if LLMs truly mimic human learning.

3. **Interdisciplinary Pushback**  
   Participants advocate for interdisciplinary approaches, blending cognitive science, neuroscience, and engineering. Critics of AGI-centric goals highlight the value of diverse, specific research aims (e.g., improving language modeling or vision systems) over monolithic AGI pursuits.

4. **Corporate Motives and Ethics**  
   Concerns arise about companies using AGI narratives to attract investment, with references to Effective Altruism (EA) and longtermism influencing groups like Anthropic. Some accuse firms of prioritizing hype over transparency, hindering reproducible research.

5. **Technical vs. Philosophical Debates**  
   While some defend AGI as a legitimate scientific goal (e.g., understanding human thinking), others dismiss it as unscientific. Analogies like "parrots mimicking speech" underscore doubts about equating LLM outputs with true intelligence. The discussion also touches on whether AGI is a "post-AI" focus for companies like Google.

**Overall Sentiment**: Skepticism dominates, with many agreeing that AGI discourse is muddled by marketing and misaligned incentives. However, defenders argue AGI remains a valid, if challenging, scientific frontier. The conversation reflects broader tensions in AI research between practical engineering, theoretical understanding, and ethical accountability.
