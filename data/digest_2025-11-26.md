### Gemini CLI Tips and Tricks for Agentic Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/addyosmani/gemini-cli-tips) | 353 points | by [ayoisaiah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ayoisaiah) | [122 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46060508)

Addy Osmani collected ~30 practical tips for getting real work done with Gemini CLI—an open‑source tool that lets Google’s Gemini plan multi‑step tasks, run shell commands, edit files, and automate workflows from the command line. The guide focuses on safety-by-default (diffs and approvals before changes) with power-user tricks for speed when you need it.

Highlights:
- Setup and auth: npm install or npx; free Google login tier or API key for higher quotas.
- Safety and control: proposed actions show diffs/commands for approval; “YOLO mode” can auto‑approve (use cautiously).
- Context and memory: GEMINI.md for persistent context, memory add/recall, conversation compression, checkpoints and /restore as an undo.
- Tooling and extensibility: custom slash commands, MCP servers, on‑the‑fly tool creation, PATH customization, treat any CLI as a tool, extensions.
- Workflow boosters: reference files/images with @, passthrough shell with !, headless/scripting mode, save/resume sessions, multi‑directory workspaces, token caching/stats.
- Integrations: VS Code for context/diffs, GitHub Action to automate repo tasks, telemetry and roadmap notes (background agents, etc.).
- Use cases: coding, debugging, content generation, system troubleshooting/config.

Why it matters: It’s a pragmatic playbook for using an “agentic” LLM safely and effectively in daily dev workflows—speeding up routine tasks while keeping guardrails in place.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the community's reaction to Addy Osmani’s Gemini CLI tips:

**Reliability and "Agentic" Limits**
There is significant skepticism regarding the reliability of current agentic workflows. Several users reported that despite the hype, these tools often "fail 80% of the time" or struggle with reliable tool calling. One user noted that while Gemini CLI is excellent for "bonkers refactoring" or reading errors, it can be unreliable for following strict directions, sometimes opting to disable linting rules rather than actually fixing the code.

**Ideal Workflows and Prompt Architecture**
To mitigate reliability issues, commenters shared their own "power user" strategies:
*   **Constraint Programming:** Moving away from conversational prompts toward strict inputs and outputs (e.g., defining exclusion rules and regex patterns for script generation).
*   **SOLID Prompting:** Structuring interaction in stages—Step 1: Define `PROBLEM.md`, Step 2: Agent updates scope, Step 3: Agent creates a plan, Step 4: Implementation.
*   **Context Abuse:** One user argued the best way to use Gemini CLI is to "abuse" its 1M–2M token context window, dumping entire codebases or massive contexts into the tool to gain advantages over models with smaller windows like Claude or Cursor.

**The "Junior Developer" Analogy**
A debate emerged regarding the mental model for using these agents:
*   **The Skeptics:** Users argued that "mentoring" an AI agent is time wasted compared to a human junior developer. Humans learn and grow professionally; an AI "forgets" as soon as the context window slides or the session ends.
*   **The Proponents:** Others found success treating LLMs like "naive savants" or interns. They argued that anthropomorphizing the model (treating it like a person) actually improves results because it forces the human operator to provide clarity, sufficient context, and good information hygiene—practices that work well for both humans and LLMs.

**Tooling Comparisons**
While Addy Osmani’s reputation (Google Chrome, engineering management books) lent credibility to the tool, users compared Gemini CLI against competitors. Some felt it lagged behind **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, or **Codex** for complex coding tasks. However, the open-source nature of the CLI and its extensibility were seen as potential bridged gaps. Early testers of Gemini 3.0 Pro (preview) expressed disappointment, noting it still struggled with simple coding tasks and felt like a "rushed launch."

### Fara-7B: An efficient agentic model for computer use

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/microsoft/fara) | 165 points | by [maxloh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=maxloh) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46061208)

Microsoft open-sources Fara-7B: a compact “computer-use” agent that drives the browser with mouse and keyboard

- What it is: Fara-7B is a 7B-parameter agentic model built to operate computers like a human—seeing webpages, clicking predicted coordinates, typing, and scrolling—without relying on DOM/accessibility trees or helper parsers. It’s based on Qwen2.5-VL-7B and trained via supervised fine-tuning on 145K synthetic trajectories generated with the Magentic-One multi-agent pipeline.

- Why it matters: At 7B, it’s small enough to run locally for lower latency and better privacy, yet posts state-of-the-art results for its size on multiple web-agent benchmarks. It also completes tasks efficiently, averaging ~16 steps per task vs ~41 for comparable models.

- What it can do: Everyday web automation—search/summarize, fill forms, manage accounts, book flights/hotels/restaurants, shop and compare prices, find jobs and real estate.

- How it performs:
  - Benchmarks (success rate %): WebVoyager 73.5, Online-M2W 34.1, DeepShop 26.2, WebTailBench 38.4.
  - Outperforms other 7B computer-use models (e.g., UI-TARS-1.5-7B) and OpenAI’s computer-use preview on WebTailBench; larger SoM agents powered by GPT-4o/o3-mini still lead overall.
  - New benchmark: WebTailBench (609 tasks across 11 real-world categories). Fara-7B tops other computer-use models across all segments.

- Try it: Serve “microsoft/Fara-7B” with vLLM, use Playwright for browser control, and interact via the fara-cli. MIT-licensed. The team says human-verified annotations and a task-verification pipeline are coming; this is an early, experimental release.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The "Buried Lede": Qwen2.5 Base & Censorship**
The most discussed aspect was not the agent itself, but its foundation: Microsoft fine-tuned Fara-7B on Alibaba’s **Qwen2.5-VL**. Users noted the irony of a major US tech giant building on top of a Chinese open-weight model. One user testing the model found that it inherited strict censorship filters, refusing to process queries related to "Tiananmen Square 1989" due to "sensitive political historical content," while readily answering questions about Western history (e.g., the Battle of the Somme).

**Critique of "AI Bloat" in Automation**
A segment of the discussion expressed skepticism about using a 7-billion parameter GPU-heavy model to perform tasks like clicking buttons and filling forms. Critics argued this represents a "broken software stack" where traditional, efficient scripting has been abandoned for resource-intensive AI. As one commenter put it, "Needing a heavy GPU is a risk... if the interface changes, you [should just] update scripts."

**Scope and Limitations**
Technical users clarified that despite the "computer-use" label, Fara-7B is currently limited to browser interactions (via Playwright) and cannot handle OS-level desktop applications (like CAD software) in the way Anthropic’s Computer Use or other generalist agents might.

**Market Strategy Observations**
Commenters analyzed Microsoft's open-source strategy, noting a pattern: the company releases smaller, specialized models trained on synthetic data (often fine-tunes of others) while keeping their "flagship" intelligence (via OpenAI) proprietary. This was contrasted with Meta and various Chinese labs, which continue to release high-capability open weights.

**Benchmarks**
Users dug into the new **WebTailBench** data provided in the repo, noting that while Fara-7B outperforms other 7B models, larger "System of Minds" (SoM) agents powered by GPT-4o still dominate complex tasks like flight bookings and comparison shopping.

### Indie game developers have a new sales pitch: being 'AI free'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders) | 150 points | by [01-_-](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=01-_-) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46057000)

The Verge reports a growing indie push to market games as made entirely by humans, positioning “no gen AI” as both an ethical stance and a brand differentiator. The movement coalesced after Nexon CEO Junghun Lee said “assume that every game company is now using AI,” prompting indie developers to publicly rebut the claim and signal their values to players.

Key points
- DIY “no gen AI” seal: Polygon Treehouse’s Alex Kanaris-Sotiriou helped launch a freely usable golden cog badge reading “This developer assures that no gen AI was used in this indie game.” It’s appearing on store pages like Rosewater, Astral Ascent, and Quarterstaff, and serves as a counterpoint to platforms’ AI disclosure rules.
- Values as marketing: Devs cite fairness and consent around training data as reasons to avoid gen AI, while also using “human-made” as a trust signal to players. D-Cell Games’ Unbeatable posted: “Absolutely everything… was created by human beings without any generative assistance… every moment flawed and messy because we are, also.”
- Industry split: Big publishers are leaning in—EA partnered with Stability AI; Microsoft is experimenting with AI-generated gameplay; Ubisoft touts Neo NPCs and its Ghostwriter tool. Gen-AI assets are showing up in major titles (e.g., Call of Duty: Black Ops 6/7, Anno 117, The Alters, The Finals, Arc Raiders, InZoi), while Krafton pushed an “AI-first” reorg.
- Economic backdrop: With budgets ballooning and indie funding tightening, AI promises faster, cheaper production. Some indies argue it still doesn’t meet their quality bar and wastes effort versus experienced humans.

Why it matters
- Differentiation: “Human-made” could become a consumer-facing label akin to “organic” or “fair trade” for games, especially among audiences wary of AI.
- Trust and transparency: Expect more badges, disclosures, and store filters around AI usage as a competitive signal.
- Verification gap: There’s no clear way to audit “AI-free” claims, setting up potential friction with platform policies and future regulation.

Bottom line: As major studios normalize gen AI in pipelines, a subset of indies is turning abstention into identity and marketing—betting that craft, consent, and human imperfection are features players will pay for.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the reactions to the submission:

**The Value of Effort vs. The "Slopification" of Steam**
A central theme of the discussion was the relationship between human effort and perceived value. One user used the analogy of a toothpick sculpture: it is impressive because a human spent two years making it; if an AI generates the same image in seconds, the appreciation vanishes because the "narrative layer" of human struggle is gone.
*   **Choice Fatigue:** Commenters worried that if AI makes creating "toothpick sculptures" effortless, Steam will be flooded with millions of indistinguishable games ("slopification"), making it impossible for players to find human-made content.
*   **Scarcity:** Users argued that "proof of work" and scarcity are what create value in art, and fast generation dilutes that value.

**Skepticism of "Artisanal" Marketing**
Some users viewed the "AI-free" label with cynicism, comparing it to clothing brands that market goods as "artisanal" or "hand-made" while outsourcing the actual labor to mass-manufacturing facilities.
*   **Trust Issues:** There is debate over whether "hand-made" is a genuine sign of maturity and craft, or simply a new marketing spin to appeal to anti-technology sentiments without actually guaranteeing quality.

**"Soul" and Intentionality**
Commenters debated whether AI content lacks the "spirit" or specific artistic intent found in classic media (referencing the deliberate choreography in *The Matrix* or effects in *Jurassic Park*).
*   **The "Showy" Trap:** Critics argued that AI art often provides a "showy" surface level aesthetic but lacks the deeper connection or logic that comes from human decision-making.
*   **Counterpoint:** Others pointed out that some workflows (like Corridor Digital’s VFX) involve significant human creativity alongside AI tools, yet they still face stigma simply for using the technology.

**Nuance in Definitions and Usage**
There was discussion regarding where the line is drawn for "AI-free."
*   **Utility vs. Creativity:** Some users are fine with AI being used for code, bug fixing, or repetitive textures (grunt work) but object to it replacing creative direction, art, or writing.
*   **Current Adoption:** Users noted that heavily played games, such as *Stellaris*, already disclose AI usage (approx. 8% of Steam games do), suggesting that AI is already entrenched in successful titles regardless of the indie backlash.
*   **Dynamic Promises:** referencing past broken promises like *Skyrim’s* "dynamic economy," users expressed skepticism that AI would actually create deep, living worlds, suggesting it might just create more dynamic "lies" or surface-level assets.

### Compressed filesystems à la language models

#### [Submission URL](https://grohan.co/2025/11/25/llmfuse/) | 57 points | by [grohan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grohan) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46058033)

TL;DR: A systems engineer fine-tunes a small LLM to act as a filesystem engine behind FUSE, then pivots to a clever idea: use the model itself as a compression scheme for filesystem state via arithmetic coding.

What’s new
- The author trains a 4B-parameter model (Qwen3-4B) to handle a minimal, read/write-ish subset of FUSE by predicting filesystem state transitions.
- Training data comes from a loopback FUSE that mirrors a real host directory while logging every operation plus the full filesystem tree at each step.
- Prompts: FUSE op + an XML-encoded filesystem tree. 
  - Reads: model returns requested content/metadata.
  - Writes: model outputs the entire updated tree state.
- Results: ~98% hold-out accuracy after 8 epochs on ~15k samples; then mounts a real FUSE FS that forwards each syscall to the LLM and successfully ls/cat/echo around.

Why it’s interesting
- It’s a clean demonstration that LLMs can model stateful system semantics, not just text, when the state is made explicit in the prompt.
- The XML “state dump” is wildly verbose—but that structure is also “baked into” the model’s weights after fine-tuning.
- This leads to the key insight: use the LLM as a probabilistic model for lossless compression of the filesystem state via arithmetic coding.

Compression angle
- Revisits Marcus Hutter’s long-standing “AI ≈ compression” claim; cites modern results where a relatively small LLM achieves state-of-the-art compression on enwik datasets (e.g., Fabrice Bellard’s 169M-parameter model).
- Core trick: arithmetic coding turns a predictive model’s token probabilities into a reversible bitstream—so an LLM can be the codec.
- Implication: you could store your FS state as bits + “the model” and recover it exactly using the model as the decoder.

Caveats and open questions
- Performance: every FUSE op becomes an LLM call—latency, throughput, and cost are non-trivial.
- Correctness/consistency: omitted ops (open, fsync, xattrs, locking) and concurrency/crash semantics aren’t addressed.
- Determinism: decoding requires stable, exact probabilities; inference must be reproducible and numerically consistent.
- Security: file contents feed the prompt surface; injection and sandboxing matter.
- Practicality: XML diffs vs full-tree rewrites, binary state encodings, and constrained decoding would likely be needed.

Bottom line
- As a systems-meets-ML experiment, it’s delightful: a mountable, LLM-backed filesystem that doubles as a thought experiment in “model-coded” storage.
- The real payoff is the compression perspective: if your model knows your domain, arithmetic coding can turn that knowledge into tight, lossless encodings—potentially for complex, structured states like filesystems.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Compression Benchmarks & "Cheating" with LLMs**
The most active debate centers on the validity of using LLMs for compression (the Hutter Prize context).
*   **The Model Size Argument:** **Dylan16807** argues that LLMs have an "unfair advantage" in compression benchmarks if the size of the model itself isn't counted against the final file size; they note that on smaller datasets (like *enwik8*), the overhead of the model makes LLMs perform poorly.
*   **Counterpoint:** **grhn** and **smplcgy** refute this, pointing out that legitimate benchmarks (like the Large Text Compression Benchmark) and the Hutter Prize rules *do* require the decompressor (or model) size to be included in the final calculation.
*   **Prior Art:** Several users note that Fabrice Bellard has already explored this territory thoroughly with **`nncp`** (which counts the model size and held top records circa 2019-2021) and **`ts_zip`**.

**Nostalgia and Engineering**
*   **PaulHoule** draws a parallel between this modern experiment and the "yearning to write a filesystem" in the 1980s. They share an anecdote about a friend on a TRS-80 Color Computer who wrote a custom system to bypass RS-DOS inefficiencies, cramming 180k of data onto a 157k disk by eliminating wasted space and metadata overhead.

**Other Takeaways**
*   **Practicality:** **N_Lens** praises the experiment but highlights the practical caveats: reliance on GPUs, context window scaling issues, and the limitation to text-based data.
*   **Inspiration:** **ndfrch** mentions they were considering a similar implementation and found the post provided the motivation to attempt it over the weekend.

### Image Diffusion Models Exhibit Emergent Temporal Propagation in Videos

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19936) | 121 points | by [50kIters](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=50kIters) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46055177)

Image Diffusion Models Can Track Objects in Videos—Zero-Shot

- Key idea: Self-attention maps inside image diffusion models (trained only for images) act like semantic “label propagation” kernels. Extended across frames, they provide pixel-level correspondences that enable zero-shot video object tracking by segmentation—no video training required.

- How it works:
  - Reinterpret attention maps as propagation kernels to carry labels between frames.
  - Test-time optimization boosts consistency and robustness:
    - DDIM inversion to align each frame with the model’s latent trajectory,
    - Textual inversion to bind the target object to a learned token,
    - Adaptive head weighting to favor the most semantically useful attention heads.
  - DRIFT framework layers on SAM-guided mask refinement for cleaner boundaries.

- Results: Reports state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on standard video object segmentation benchmarks.

- Why it matters: Suggests strong, emergent temporal understanding in off-the-shelf image diffusion models, potentially cutting out specialized video training. Useful for tracking, video editing, AR, and any setup needing consistent object masks over time.

Paper: “Image Diffusion Models Exhibit Emergent Temporal Propagation in Videos” (arXiv:2511.19936) DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2511.19936

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Latent Capabilities in "Older" Models**
The discussion opened with appreciation for how much information is "hidden" within the weights of models like Stable Diffusion 1.5. Users noted that despite being trained in 2022, SD 1.5 remains a favorite playground for researchers and hobbyists due to its size and rich semantics. Detailed sub-threads discussed "hacking" these models using techniques like SVD decomposition on frozen weights and experimenting with flow matching–based sampling methods versus traditional diffusion noise schedules.

**Explaining the Mechanism**
Commenters worked to simplify the paper's concepts, describing the core mechanism as repurposing self-attention layers. While cross-attention usually links text to pixels, self-attention links pixels to other pixels within an image; the paper demonstrates that this can be extended across video frames to propagate segmentation without specific video training. This sparked a debate on whether this counts as "emergent" behavior or simply the logical result of training on massive datasets containing implicit structural relationships.

**Biological Parallels**
The finding prompted comparisons to biological vision. Users discussed how the human visual system (specifically the retina and LGN) performs heavy pre-processing—such as optical flow and edge detection—before data reaches the cortex. Some viewers saw the model's ability to track objects as analogous to the evolutionary development of visual motility and physical understanding.

**Technical Critique on Metrics**
A user with background in soft validation metrics (from their PhD thesis) critiqued the use of "Soft IoU" (Intersection over Union) in the paper. They argued that soft operators significantly outperform binary thresholding (like standard IoU or F1 scores) in reliability. They expressed hope that the industry would move further toward fuzzy predictors and soft ground truths, noting that binary thresholding often discards valuable semantic data in probability maps.

***

**Summary of Discussion**
The discussion thread focused on the accessibility of elite university content, the evolving relevance of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the age of LLMs, and technical distinctions between RL and traditional Machine Learning.

**Open Access vs. University Business Models**
A significant portion of the discussion lamented the shift away from the "pandemic era" openness, where many institutions temporarily made lectures public.
*   Users discussed the friction between universities protecting their value proposition (tuition/grades) and the public benefit of sharing knowledge.
*   While some argued that professors withhold lectures for copyright or prestige reasons, others countered that "watered down" MOOCs serve a valid purpose as a bridge to advanced material.
*   MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) was cited as a gold standard, though some noted it often lacks depth for advanced graduate-level topics compared to in-person equivalents.

**Is Traditional RL Obsolete? (DPO & LLMs)**
A debate emerged regarding the utility of traditional RL curricula given the rise of techniques like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO).
*   **The Skeptics:** Some users questioned if learning detailed RL theory is necessary when modern LLM training relies heavily on DPO/GRPO, suggesting parts of the traditional RL stack might be obsolete for text generation.
*   **The Defenders:** Counter-arguments highlighted that while LLMs use RL for alignment (RLHF), RL remains the dominant paradigm for **control problems**—such as robotics, self-driving cars, and game playing—where the goal is a sequence of optimal decisions rather than static generation. Users emphasized that "generating text" and "controlling a system in an environment" are fundamentally different mathematical problems.

**Technical Distinctions: RL vs. Supervised Learning**
Several comments addressed confusion from practitioners coming from traditional ML backgrounds (e.g., classification/regression) regarding why RL is needed at all.
*   The consensus explanation was that RL is necessary when there is no immediate feedback (labels) for every action.
*   Commenters explained that while supervised learning minimizes error on a known value (like house prices), RL maximizes a cumulative reward over time in scenarios where a specific action's value isn't known until the end of the sequence (e.g., winning a chess game).

### OpenAI needs to raise at least $207B by 2030

#### [Submission URL](https://ft.com/content/23e54a28-6f63-4533-ab96-3756d9c88bad) | 537 points | by [akira_067](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=akira_067) | [558 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46058065)

HSBC estimates OpenAI would have to raise at least $207 billion by 2030 to sustain its current trajectory of heavy spending and negative unit economics—an eye-watering figure that underscores how capital-intensive frontier AI has become.

Why it matters
- Suggests that even at massive scale, today’s AI models may not cover their compute and power costs without continued external financing.
- Implies ongoing dependence on strategic partners (notably Microsoft), sovereign funds, and debt markets to bankroll training and inference.

What that number likely bakes in
- Huge capex for GPUs/accelerators, data centers, and long-term power deals.
- Ongoing inference subsidies to drive user growth and enterprise adoption.
- Slow improvement in unit economics absent major gains in efficiency or pricing power.

Context
- Follows earlier mega-funding chatter around AI chips and data centers; the estimate is far below “trillions” talk but still on par with the largest capex cycles in tech history.
- The broader hyperscaler arms race (Microsoft, Google, AWS) is already pushing industry capex toward record highs, driven by AI.

Skepticism to keep in mind
- Sell-side numbers can be back-of-the-envelope and sensitive to assumptions on model size, training cadence, hardware prices, power costs, and revenue growth.
- Breakthroughs in algorithmic efficiency, custom silicon, or better monetization could shrink the capital need dramatically.

What to watch
- OpenAI/Microsoft capex disclosures, long-term power/compute deals, and GPU supply.
- Inference pricing trends and enterprise attach rates (do margins improve?).
- Evidence of efficiency leaps (model compression, better architectures, on-device/offline inference) that bend the cost curve.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Skepticism on Value Capture and Business Model**
Commenters debated whether OpenAI can actually capture enough value to justify the projected capital needs. Some users argued that OpenAI’s intelligence layer is risking commoditization. While the company faces "pharma-style" high R&D costs, it lacks a guaranteed monopoly on distribution compared to giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google, who control the operating systems and browsers. One user noted that while OpenAI generates compelling media, its Total Addressable Market (TAM) might shrink if it simply deflates the cost of production for content that is currently expensive.

**The Shopping and Search Wars (OpenAI vs. Amazon)**
A significant portion of the conversation focused on the threat OpenAI poses to Amazon and Google’s search dominance, specifically regarding e-commerce:
*   **The "Agent" Economy:** Users speculated that future consumers might ask an AI agent to "buy the best mechanical keyboard" rather than scrolling through Amazon search results. This shifts the power dynamic from the marketplace to the AI interface.
*   **Retail Alliances:** It was noted that OpenAI has announced partnerships with retailers like Walmart, Target, Etsy, and Shopify. Some view this as an attempt to build a backend coalition against Amazon.
*   **Frontend Control:** Skeptics argued that Big Tech companies (like Amazon) rarely allow third parties to control the frontend customer relationship, drawing parallels to how streaming services refuse to integrate fully with universal search on cable boxes or Apple TV.

**The Advertising Paradox in Chatbots**
There was a technical and philosophical debate about how OpenAI can monetize through ads (historically the cash cow for search):
*   **The "One Answer" Problem:** In traditional search, users choose from a list of links (an auction model). In a chatbot, the AI provides a single answer. Users argued that if OpenAI sells that "single answer" to the highest bidder (e.g., recommending a specific brand because they paid), it destroys the trust required for an intelligence agent.
*   **Intent vs. Accident:** A debate emerged regarding Google’s $200B ad revenue. Some claimed it is driven by confused users clicking accidentally or indistinguishable ad placements, whereas others argued it is legitimate commercial intent. The consensus was that replicating this high-margin revenue in a conversational interface without degrading the user experience is an unsolved problem.

**Amazon’s Moat: Logistics vs. Intelligence**
Several commenters defended Amazon’s position, arguing that its moat is not just search, but logistics, returns, and convenience. Even if an AI agent can find a product, it cannot replicate the logistics network required to deliver it the next day. However, others noted that if AI controls the "recommendation layer," Amazon could be relegated to a "dumb pipe" for fulfillment, losing its high-margin advertising business. Comparisons were also made to Amazon's "Rufus" AI and Alexa, with users noting that voice/chat commerce has historically struggled due to a lack of visual interfaces.
