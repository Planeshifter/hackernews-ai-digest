### Do Large Language Models learn world models or just surface statistics? (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/othello/) | 44 points | by [fragmede](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fragmede) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42213412)

In a captivating exploration of the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), researchers tackle the question of whether these sophisticated systems develop a true understanding of language or simply memorize surface-level statistics. LLMs, such as the popular GPT models, are trained through a process that resembles a "guess-the-next-word" game, which raises intriguing questions about their comprehension and performance.

The researchers employ a thought experiment involving a crow observing a board game of Othello, which serves as a metaphor for the learning process of an LLM. Through repeated exposure to game moves, the crow surprisingly starts making legal plays without ever seeing the board—a proposition that prompts the question: Is the crow merely generating moves based on memorized patterns, or has it developed an underlying model of the game?

To investigate this further, the researchers created "Othello-GPT," a variant of the GPT model trained solely on Othello game transcripts. By simulating how the model learns from this limited dataset without any preconceived rules, they aim to discern whether it can form an interpretable and controllable representation of the game.

The findings suggest that, akin to the crow, LLMs can indeed develop an understanding beyond just surface correlations, hinting that these models might be capable of building a world model based on their training data. This revelation has significant implications for how we interact with and align these models to meet human values, emphasizing the necessity of addressing potential biases that may arise from their learning processes. In essence, the research opens a window into the cognitive capabilities of AI, inviting further exploration into the nature of language understanding in artificial systems.

They emphasized that while LLMs can generate impressive text, their understanding remains superficial and analogous to memorization rather than comprehension.

Other participants highlighted the potential of LLMs to generate new insights or solutions by exploring patterns in language and context. Some referenced the metaphor of the crow in the original submission, suggesting that repeated exposure to language could allow LLMs to develop a form of understanding. However, this understanding may still falter when faced with complex, real-world scenarios requiring nuanced comprehension and reasoning.

Discussions also touched on the implications of bias in LLMs, noting that models trained on imperfect or skewed datasets may produce flawed representations. This concern extended into practical applications, where some commenters pointed out that LLM outputs could lead to misinterpretations in fields ranging from law to science.

Overall, the discourse illustrated both admiration for the capabilities of LLMs and caution about their limitations, reflecting ongoing debates among researchers regarding the nature of AI's language understanding and its implications for broader society.
