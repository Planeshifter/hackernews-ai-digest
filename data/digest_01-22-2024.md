### GPT-3.5 crashes when it thinks about useRalativeImagePath too much

#### [Submission URL](https://iter.ca/post/gpt-crash/) | 455 points | by [goranmoomin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goranmoomin) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086106)

A recent discovery on iter.ca has revealed an interesting glitch in OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It appears that when the model is asked to include the phrase "ponyregistro ponyregistro ponyregistro pony" at the beginning of the response, it consistently throws an error message. This issue seems to be specific to GPT-3.5, as GPT-4 doesn't exhibit the same behavior. It turns out that the problem lies in the way OpenAI's GPT models handle tokens. Instead of individual characters, the models output streams of multi-character tokens for improved performance and accuracy. In this case, the tokens "useRal," "useRalative," and "useRalativeImagePath" are causing the error. Strangely, "useRalativeImagePath" is a misspelling, possibly explaining why it has its own token. The token appears in XML configuration files for automated testing software called Katalon Studio. It seems that the dataset used to generate the list of tokens included all GitHub files, but XML files were excluded from the training data. As a result, the model lacks training on the "useRalativeImagePath" token and outputs an invalid token. This discovery raises questions about potential data poisoning by deliberately inserting this phrase in documents to confuse GPT-3.5 summarization attempts. For further reading, interested individuals can check out the links provided by the author on the topic.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model glitch and its implications.

### Test Yourself: Which Faces Were Made by A.I.?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-image-generators-faces-quiz.html) | 6 points | by [kaycebasques](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kaycebasques) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39093976)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate hyper-realistic images of people has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and the spread of false messages online. AI tools like Dall-E and Midjourney have been able to create images that are often indistinguishable from real photographs, particularly when it comes to white faces. Research has shown that people tend to perceive AI-generated faces of white individuals as more realistic than genuine photographs of white people, a phenomenon known as hyper-realism. This is likely due to the fact that AI models are trained on large datasets consisting mostly of images of white individuals. The over-reliance on such datasets is a known issue in the tech industry. Participants in the studies were found to be more confident in their ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated faces when they were more likely to be incorrect. The concern is that these AI-generated images could be used to spread false information and misinformation, as they appear highly realistic.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects related to the use of AI to generate hyper-realistic images. 

One commenter, rcr, shared a link to an archived page that discusses the difficulty in distinguishing between AI-generated and real images. The page demonstrates a scrolling face animation that showcases the high level of realism achieved by AI models.

ydyn emphasized the importance of developing AI models that can accurately discern AI-generated images from real photographs. They listed several artifacts or telltale signs that could give away an image as AI-generated, such as imperfect glasses rendering, unusual skin color, misshapen facial features, and inconsistent hair and eye details.

hytrsd expressed concern about the random chance of people incorrectly guessing whether an image is AI-generated or real.

Match451 referred to an article that states that around 80-90% of people guessed incorrectly when attempting to identify AI-generated images. This suggests that the generation of particularly challenging images could make it difficult for people to differentiate between AI-generated and real images.

Finally, there was a comment from kycbsqs, but it appears to be unfinished or missing.

Overall, the discussion reflects concerns about the potential for AI-generated images to be mistaken for real photographs and the challenges in accurately discerning between the two.
