### I built a large language model "from scratch"

#### [Submission URL](https://brettgfitzgerald.com/posts/build-a-large-language-model/) | 86 points | by [controversy187](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=controversy187) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43107777)

Building a large language model from scratch? That might sound daunting, but one passionate machine learning enthusiast just completed this challenging journey with the help of Sebastian Raschka's book, "Build a Large Language Model (From Scratch)." This A.I. hobbyist embarked on a mission to not only learn the intricacies of language models but also to live the hands-on experience of creating one—coding every single line without copy-pasting (well, mostly). 

Compiling a model on his humble laptop, the hobbyist embraced the tech promise that anyone could build a large language model using consumer-grade technology. The expedition was not without its hurdles, like managing execution times and sizeable data sets, but persistence paid off. While he confessed to sometimes rushing through sections and skipping some exercises, he found a rhythm and motivation to push onward to completion, even taking breaks for the holiday season.

His commitment was not just about writing code; it was a deep dive into understanding how LLMs process language through tokenization and constructing a dataset vocabulary. By representing words as numerical tokens—a process computers prefer—the groundwork for language understanding was laid. The challenge then expanded to training the model to grasp relationships between these tokenized words, simulating the connections "cat" might have with "jump" and "mouse" in cooldown scenarios.

The learner shares his revelations on model training, token relationships, and the text generation process. Illustrated through a simple example, when the model encounters "My cat saw a mouse and it," it might predict "jumped" as the next word based on learned patterns. It's all a linguistic ballet of predicting and generating text, fed back into the model for looping and learning—the essence of machine understanding.

In the end, the weights of the model—that is, the saved understandings and connections among all those tokenized words—become the heart of the engine ready to be shared and deployed. The journey through Raschka's work didn't just teach our ML aficionado how to build models but opened doors of curiosity, compelling him to learn and explore more—an inspiring pursuit for anyone looking to dive into the world of AI.

### Apple’s closed-source approach is losing out to AI app builders

#### [Submission URL](https://www.telkins.dev/blog/how-apples-closed-source-approach-is-losing-out-to-ai-app-builders) | 93 points | by [trevor-e](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trevor-e) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43107382)

In the evolving world of app development, seasoned iOS developers are feeling trapped in a forest of outdated practices while the landscape changes around them. Trevor Elkins reflects on his frustration with Apple's closed-source ecosystem, which he argues is a growing disaster keeping iOS development static and less inviting compared to more open, AI-powered platforms like Lovable.dev and a0.dev. In fact, 40% of the top iOS shopping apps are now non-native, a trend fueled by easier and more flexible development alternatives that don’t rely on Apple's proprietary systems.

Building for iOS isn’t just about writing code; it’s about navigating Apple's laborious and often clunky tools. Even something as simple as compiling code can be a headache, requiring a Mac and multiple workarounds through Xcode's complex landscape. This becomes even more challenging when factoring in tasks like adding files, where the proprietary project format can easily trip developers up without third-party hacks like the xcodeproj Ruby gem.

Despite some glimmers of hope, such as Swift Build’s open-source status and improvements like buildable folders in Xcode 16, Elkins sees these as too little, too late. The previewing process is another hurdle: while platforms like a0.dev can effortlessly serve previews through a browser, iOS development remains shackled to memory-hungry simulators with complex, closed-source processes.

Elkins dreams of a future where iOS could have something akin to React Native for web previews, but with SwiftUI also closed-source, developers remain at Apple's whim for any innovations. While projects like OpenSwiftUI work to bridge these gaps, they require painstaking reverse engineering. In short, iOS development remains in Apple's iron grip, while others flourish in a more liberated and dynamic landscape.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and trends in iOS development, particularly the rise of non-native apps and AI tools, alongside frustrations with Apple's ecosystem:  

1. **Non-Native Apps & Performance Trade-offs**:  
   - Evan Bacon’s claim that 40% of top iOS shopping apps are non-native (e.g., Expo/React Native) sparked debate. Critics argue such apps often prioritize developer productivity over user experience, leading to slower performance and clunky UX compared to native apps.  
   - Others counter that cross-platform tools (like Expo) are practical for budget-conscious projects, even if they sacrifice polish.  

2. **Apple’s Restrictive Ecosystem**:  
   - Developers criticize Apple’s closed-source tools (e.g., Xcode), proprietary hardware requirements, and policies that disadvantage native development. Some argue that tools like Flutter/Expo bypass App Store restrictions, creating a “gray area” in compliance.  
   - Xcode’s AI features (e.g., predictive code completion) are seen as lagging behind third-party tools like GitHub Copilot, raising concerns about Apple’s commitment to modern workflows.  

3. **AI’s Role in Development**:  
   - Proponents highlight AI’s efficiency in generating boilerplate code, debugging, and simplifying tasks like database queries. Skeptics warn that AI-generated apps risk low quality and maintenance challenges.  
   - A recurring theme: AI tools act as “electric screwdrivers” — helpful for small tasks but insufficient for complex, polished apps.  

4. **Cross-Platform Frameworks**:  
   - React Native and SwiftUI are debated. Critics claim they result in worse apps, particularly on Android, while supporters emphasize flexibility and cost savings.  
   - Tensions persist between open-source frameworks and Apple’s closed ecosystem, with Swift’s open-source status seen as insufficient to offset broader platform lock-in.  

**Key Takeaway**: Developers are divided between embracing AI/cross-platform tools for efficiency and advocating for native development’s performance and polish, all while navigating Apple’s restrictive environment.
