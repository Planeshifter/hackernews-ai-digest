The story of Nvidia's rise to prominence in the world of artificial intelligence (AI) is a fascinating one. Led by CEO Jensen Huang, Nvidia experienced a significant boost in stock-market value when it was revealed that their supercomputer, ChatGPT, had been instrumental in training an astonishing AI chatbot. This led to Nvidia becoming the sixth most valuable corporation in the world, surpassing the combined value of Walmart and ExxonMobil. Huang, often compared to the celebrated vender of prospecting supplies, Samuel Brannan, is a patient monopolist who has been running Nvidia since its inception in 1993. Initially known for their graphics-processing units (GPUs) for video gamers, Huang made a risky bet on AI in 2013 based on promising research. This move has paid off handsomely, with Nvidia's GPUs becoming instrumental in many AI advancements. Huang himself has become one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, with a stake in the company worth over forty billion dollars. Despite the fears and speculations associated with AI, Huang maintains a practical mindset and focuses on what microchips can do today and in the future. He believes that deep learning, the method behind AI development, is reshaping the digital computing landscape. While some regard the risks of AI as comparable to nuclear war, Huang remains undeterred. He dismisses the concerns, stating that AI is simply processing data and that there are more pressing matters to worry about. However, as AI continues to advance, the implications for human labor and creative pursuits are subjects of debate. Though Huang acknowledges the potential for AI to produce superior prose and impact certain professions, he assures that the impact won't be imminent. Huang's own journey, from being a dishwasher to the CEO of a trailblazing company, is a testament to his resilience and determination. From his humble beginnings in Taiwan to his formative years in the US, Huang overcame various challenges and always stayed focused on his goals. His success story is a source of inspiration, particularly in the ever-evolving landscape of AI.

### Most AI startups are doomed

#### [Submission URL](https://weightythoughts.com/p/most-ai-startups-are-doomed) | 173 points | by [j-wang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=j-wang) | [128 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38450087)

In a thought-provoking post on Weighty Thoughts, VC James Wang argues that most AI startups are doomed to fail. Wang explains that many startups in the AI space simply bring together existing generative AI APIs, add some user interface, and call themselves AI startups. However, he believes these companies lack defensibility and differentiation, making them vulnerable to competition. Wang goes on to argue that even more advanced AI models like ChatGPT have no real moat and can be replicated by larger companies. He also highlights the rapid pace at which the AI industry is evolving, making it difficult for any single company to maintain a competitive edge. Ultimately, Wang suggests that AI startups need to focus on truly innovative and defensible technologies in order to succeed.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the idea of the winner-takes-all effect in the AI industry and the challenges faced by AI startups.

One user highlights the parallel between search engines and AI startups, stating that just as search engines became winners in the 90s by gathering text data and building well-known information retrieval algorithms like PageRank, AI companies today gather data to improve their products. However, another user argues that AI startups have the advantage of utilizing machine learning techniques, which computers cannot just "slyly copy." They emphasize the importance of gathering proprietary data to create a competitive advantage.

The discussion also touches on the role of quality products, market competition, and the difficulty of building a unique and successful product. There is a mention of the term "economic moat," which refers to the ability of a company to maintain a competitive advantage over its rivals.

One user brings up the importance of building great products and cites examples of successful companies like Google and Gmail. Another user points out that the difficulty of replicating proprietary products prevents competitors from creating exact clones.

The thread also includes a reference to Warren Buffet's concept of an economic moat and discusses the impact of defaults in user preferences and the network effect in the AI industry.

Overall, the discussion recognizes the challenges faced by AI startups in achieving differentiation and defensibility, but also highlights the potential for success through innovative and proprietary technologies.
