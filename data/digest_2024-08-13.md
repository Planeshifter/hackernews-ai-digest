### LLM-based sentiment analysis of Hacker News posts between Jan 2020 and June 2023

#### [Submission URL](https://outerbounds.com/blog/hacker-news-sentiment/) | 119 points | by [mochomocha](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mochomocha) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41241124)

In an intriguing exploration of the Hacker News community from January 2020 to June 2023, researchers employed a powerful LLM called LLama3 to analyze over 100,000 posts. By focusing on discussion threads with more than five comments, they unveiled how topics resonate with users and which elicit strong reactions. The project tapped into Hacker News' distinct intellectual culture, confirming popular sentiments around beloved subjects like programming and open source while revealing the community's disdain for issues such as employee monitoring and police misconduct. 

As the analysis showed, the tech community has shifted significantly over time. Trending topics now prominently feature artificial intelligence and natural language processing, while former hot-button issues like the COVID pandemic have decreased in relevance. Interestingly, despite the community's generally positive disposition, the emotional landscape remains polarized, leaving no space for neutral discussions. 

With the insights gained, enthusiasts can delve further into sentiments associated with specific topics using a newly created tool, shedding light on what the Hacker News community holds dear and what it resents. This combination of data-driven analysis and emotional insights not only validates long-held intuitions but also enhances our understanding of digital discourse.

The discussion among Hacker News users centered around the application and performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in sentiment analysis, particularly in relation to traditional methods. Several participants compared the speed and efficiency of LLMs, such as LLama3, to conventional sentiment analysis tools like NLTK and spaCy, noting that LLMs are often slower yet potentially more robust. There were comments regarding the challenges of processing large datasets with these models, with some users sharing their personal experiences in attempting to analyze over 250 million words and the extended time it took.

Additionally, participants debated the effectiveness of LLMs in sentiment analysis compared to earlier techniques, suggesting that while LLMs might handle language nuances better, they are still subject to certain limitations, including issues of accuracy and context sensitivity. Some users shared technical details about their implementations and the integration of LLMs into their workflows, while others highlighted possible shifts in the landscape of NLP tools over the years.

There were also musings about the emotional polarization within communities, as revealed by the sentiment analysis, and questions about the feasibility of applying these technologies to various topics. The discussion concluded with skepticism about the universality of sentiment derived from data, suggesting it might not accurately reflect the feelings of individuals due to the complexities of language and context in digital discourse. Overall, the conversation reflected a keen interest in the evolving capabilities of LLMs and their implications for understanding community sentiments on platforms like Hacker News.
