### Lossless Acceleration of LLM via Adaptive N-Gram Parallel Decoding

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08698) | 133 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40107787)

The paper "Lossless Acceleration of Large Language Model via Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding" introduces an innovative approach called Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding (ANPD) to speed up the inference process of Large Language Models (LLMs) without compromising accuracy. By allowing the simultaneous generation of multiple tokens, ANPD significantly reduces latency by incorporating a two-stage process. It starts with a rapid drafting phase using an N-gram module that adapts based on the current context, followed by a verification phase where the original LLM confirms the proposed tokens, ensuring the integrity of the output. The study demonstrates impressive speed improvements, up to 3.67x, for models like LLaMA and its variants using ANPD. This efficient and plug-and-play enhancement eliminates the need for retraining or additional GPU memory, making it a compelling solution for accelerating LLM processing.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolved around the paper introducing Adaptive N-gram Parallel Decoding (ANPD) for speeding up the inference process of Large Language Models (LLMs).

  - **skhntd** added a short comment agreeing that beyond more flaws, there is a sense of excitement around the Cybertruck.

- **al_borland** criticized the Cybertruck's design flaws, suggesting that claiming the recall was due to looking for clicks in the market was inadequate.

### Los Angeles is using an AI program to predict homelessness

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/19/los-angeles-is-using-an-ai-pilot-program-to-try-to-predict-homelessness.html) | 16 points | by [lxm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lxm) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40102741)

In Los Angeles, a groundbreaking Homelessness Prevention Program is utilizing predictive AI to identify individuals and families at risk of homelessness, offering crucial aid to help them maintain stable housing. Launched in 2021, the initiative has already assisted nearly 800 at-risk individuals and families, with an impressive 86% retaining permanent housing upon completion of the program. Participants have access to financial support ranging from $4,000 to $8,000, providing a vital safety net in times of crisis.

One such success story involves single mom Courtney Peterson, who faced the threat of eviction after losing her job. Traditional avenues for assistance fell short until she was contacted by the Homelessness Prevention Unit, which swiftly intervened using AI-generated insights. The program's proactive approach, reaching individuals shortly after a housing loss or emergency, has proven highly effective in preventing homelessness.

The AI model behind this program, developed by the California Policy Lab at UCLA, analyzes data from multiple county departments to predict homelessness risk factors. By identifying patterns and making targeted predictions, the program can intervene early, offering support to those most in need before they reach a crisis point. Despite concerns about data privacy, the initiative's success in keeping individuals housed underscores the importance of preventive measures in tackling homelessness.

The discussion on the groundbreaking Homelessness Prevention Program in Los Angeles sparked various perspectives and comparisons to homelessness initiatives in other regions:

- **Europe vs. USA:** Users debated the approaches to homelessness in Europe and the USA, pointing out fundamental differences in legally granted housing and support services for the homeless.
