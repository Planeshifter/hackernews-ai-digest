#### [Submission URL](https://spritely.institute/news/hoot-wireworld-live-in-browser.html) | 125 points | by [paroneayea](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=paroneayea) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36299543)

The Spritely Institute has implemented Wireworld on top of Hoot's low-level assembly tools, which are part of the Guile → WASM project, to bring Spritely Goblins-powered distributed applications to the common web browser. The team targeted WASM-4, a "fantasy console" which uses low-level WebAssembly constructs. The team used Hoot to implement Wireworld and discovered that it's a great choice for playing with WebAssembly on a lower level. The entry was a completed, working demo, and was surprisingly modified, repurposed, and resized quickly by a community member.

The discussion about the submission mentions a correction regarding the cardinal directions of electrons in Copper, a thanks to the poster, and some additional information about the use of Wireworld in the Lisp Game Jam and a virtual world called Fantasary written in Spritely Goblins. There is some excitement about the progress being made and the interactivity of the project.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02707) | 100 points | by [kordlessagain](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kordlessagain) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36299246)

Researchers have developed a new model, called Orca, that learns to imitate the reasoning process of large foundation models (LFMs). Orca analyzes rich signals from GPT-4, including explanation traces and step-by-step thought processes, guided by teacher assistance from ChatGPT. To promote progressive learning, the researchers tap into diverse imitation data with judicious sampling and selection. Orca surpasses conventional state-of-the-art models and shows competitive performance in professional and academic examinations like the SAT, LSAT, GRE, and GMAT, both in zero-shot settings without CoT. The study suggests that learning from step-by-step explanations, whether they are human-generated or AI-generated, improves model capabilities and skills.

### Understanding DeepMind's sorting algorithm

#### [Submission URL](https://justine.lol/sorting/) | 337 points | by [jart](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jart) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36297476)

DeepMind, the popular AI research lab, has applied its deep learning expertise gained from building AlphaGo to develop improved sorting algorithms. They recently published a blog post detailing a paper they wrote on the use of smaller kernels for sorting algorithms. However, their code left some confusion as it was found that their kernel was intended to be used as a building block for a sorting function rather than the entire algorithm itself. The team’s contribution to LLVM libcxx aims to optimize compilers in designing sorting networks. Their novel discovery was that sometimes the “mov” instruction is unnecessary, and it shouldn’t come as a surprise that this went unnoticed for decades.

David Smith, the developer of various Apple platforms, including the Apple Watch, is excited to be a "day one" developer for Vision Pro, Apple's new augmented reality platform. Smith believes that being part of the process of finding the direction this platform takes is an opportunity, not a drawback. He confirms that the extraordinary promises Apple made about the device in the keynote were real, making for an uncompromising experience. Smith explains that there will always be a tensioned relationship between price and user experience but that with Vision Pro, Apple has taken an ambitious view on what the baseline user experience should be and then built a device able to meet those expectations. Being user experience-driven makes sense as they are establishing a completely new concept of computing, and if they miss on user experience, the whole product feels meaningless.

A University of Oxford professor of technology and regulation has called a recent open letter warning of the risk of AI wiping out humanity a "science fiction fantasy" and a "publicity stunt". Sandra Wachter, who described the probability of a "Terminator scenario" occurring as close to zero, said the attention the letter had drawn had detracted from pressing environmental, job-replacing and discriminatory issues. Dozens of experts in AI had signed the Centre for AI Safety's letter, which called for action to mitigate the risk of AI leading to human extinction, and was shared on social media by the UK Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak.

The discussion on the submission mainly consists of differing opinions on the validity of the warning about the risk of AI, with some users supporting the need to mitigate potential risks, and others dismissing the idea as a publicity stunt and highlighting other pressing issues like the environment and job replacement. There is also a discussion about the level of expertise of those who signed the warning letter and whether they have biased beliefs. One user believes that people warning of AI risks are doing so to protect their positions and interests, while another argues that such warnings should be taken seriously. The issue of the motives of those warning about AI is also noted, with one user suggesting that some experts have vested interests in building AIs in competition with others. Finally, there is a comment about the high marketing value of such warnings, suggesting that some warnings may be exaggerated for publicity purposes.

### Little Snitch “denied” connections leak your IP address: Developer response

#### [Submission URL](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2023/6/3.html) | 40 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36297404)

Little Snitch, one of the most popular network content filter extensions for Mac, has been found to leak users' IP addresses. While the developer claims that this behavior is by design and defends it, many are concerned about this serious privacy problem. The developer also cites latency as a reason for the design, but bringing up browser benchmarks seems like a red herring. Additionally, users are not given the choice between performance and privacy. While some may be willing to sacrifice performance for privacy, it remains a valid concern. The article suggests that Apple could handle network content filter extensions in the same way that Safari content blocking extensions are handled, which would mitigate some of the latency concerns without sacrificing privacy.

The discussion is focused on the relevance of IP addresses in today's internet, with one user stating that they are no longer private due to the implementation of CGNAT and IPv6. Another user argues that IP addresses were never designed with privacy in mind and that not encrypting connections is the real problem. The group also discusses the role of firewalls and their ability to block connections. One user suggests that hardware firewalls are the best option for trust and security, while another points out that Little Snitch is not in the same category as a hardware firewall. There is also a discussion about whether criticism of security frameworks is justified or not.
