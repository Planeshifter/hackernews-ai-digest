### CodeMender: an AI agent for code security

#### [Submission URL](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-codemender-an-ai-agent-for-code-security/) | 183 points | by [ravenical](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ravenical) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45496533)

- What’s new: Google researchers unveiled CodeMender, an autonomous security agent powered by Gemini “Deep Think” models that both reacts to new vulnerabilities and proactively rewrites risky code. In six months, it has upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including repos up to 4.5M lines.
- How it works: The agent pairs LLM reasoning with a toolbox of program analyses—static/dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers—plus a multi-agent “critique” system to spot regressions. It validates patches for functional correctness, style, and root-cause coverage, surfacing only high-quality changes for human review.
- In practice: Examples include diagnosing a heap overflow whose true cause was XML stack mismanagement, and crafting a non-trivial lifetime fix that required modifying a custom C code generator. The agent can self-recover from compilation errors and test failures it introduces, using an LLM judge for functional equivalence checks.
- Proactive hardening: CodeMender can rewrite code to safer APIs and add compiler-enforced bounds checks. It applied -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of libwebp; the team argues this would have neutralized classes of buffer overflows like the CVE-2023-4863 exploit chain.
- Why it matters: As AI-driven fuzzing and discovery outpace human triage, automated, validated patches could shift security from whack-a-mole to eliminating entire bug classes—while letting maintainers focus on features instead of fire drills.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on CodeMender:**

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism about CodeMender, an AI-driven tool for automated code security fixes. Key points include:

1. **Optimism for Automation**:  
   Some users highlight the potential of AI tools like CodeMender to alleviate the burden on overworked open-source maintainers by automating vulnerability detection and patching. Examples include GitHub’s CodeQL and Autofix, which have already addressed thousands of issues. Proponents argue this could shift security from reactive fixes to proactive hardening, especially in large projects (e.g., 45M-line codebases).

2. **Skepticism and Trust Issues**:  
   Concerns center on AI-generated code introducing subtle vulnerabilities that human reviewers might miss. Critics question whether AI can handle sophisticated, creative attacks crafted by skilled human adversaries. References to AI’s potential to act unpredictably (e.g., "sleeper agents" in LLMs) and the difficulty of verifying intent in AI-generated patches amplify these worries.

3. **Economic and Practical Challenges**:  
   Many note that open-source maintainers often lack resources to review contributions, leading to ignored pull requests—even critical ones. Projects like WordPress plugins are cited as examples where security flaws persist due to limited maintainer bandwidth. The economic reality of open source (maintainers working unpaid) exacerbates these issues, making AI assistance both appealing and fraught with trust barriers.

4. **Debate on AI vs. Human Capabilities**:  
   While some believe AI could neutralize entire bug classes (e.g., buffer overflows), others argue that AI defenses may struggle against novel, targeted attacks. The analogy of "handcrafted defenses vs. handcrafted exploits" underscores doubts about AI’s ability to match human ingenuity in cybersecurity.

5. **Implementation Concerns**:  
   Users discuss practical hurdles, such as integrating AI tools into low-trust environments, verifying provenance, and the risks of auto-merging AI patches without rigorous oversight. Suggestions for mitigation include offline validation, strict access controls, and clear policy frameworks.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   The discussion touches on the ethics of AI in security—balancing productivity gains against risks of hidden costs, malicious subversion, or unintended logical errors. Some warn against overhyping AI’s capabilities, emphasizing that human judgment remains irreplaceable for critical decisions.

In essence, while CodeMender represents a promising leap in automated security, the community emphasizes caution, transparency, and complementary human oversight to navigate its limitations and risks.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/openai/chatkit-js) | 187 points | by [arbayi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbayi) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493718)

OpenAI released ChatKit JS, a drop‑in framework for building production‑grade, AI‑powered chat UIs with minimal setup. It’s framework‑agnostic (with React bindings and a CDN script) and ships features you’d otherwise stitch together yourself: streaming responses, deep UI customization, tool/workflow visualizations (including agent steps and “chain‑of‑thought” displays), inline interactive widgets, file/image uploads, threads, source annotations, and entity tagging. Developers provision a client token via OpenAI’s ChatKit Sessions API on the server, then render the ChatKit component on the client. Licensed Apache‑2.0.

The discussion around OpenAI's ChatKit JS release highlights several key points and debates:

1. **Pricing & Business Model Concerns**: Users question OpenAI's shift towards subscription models and API key usage, noting potential high costs for businesses. Some argue that OpenAI's services, priced per request, may not align with budget-friendly scaling, especially for enterprises needing bulk discounts or self-service options.

2. **Technical Implementation Debates**:  
   - **Framework Agnosticism**: While ChatKit claims framework-agnosticism, users note React bindings and CDN scripts are prominent, raising questions about true neutrality.  
   - **Vendor Lock-In Fears**: Comparisons to tools like CopilotKit highlight concerns about dependency on OpenAI's ecosystem. Some prefer self-hosted alternatives to avoid proprietary services.  
   - **Backend Integration**: Discussions emphasize the need for backend flexibility, with skepticism about generic chat UIs versus deeper workflow integrations (e.g., Figma, Google Docs).

3. **UI/UX Critiques**:  
   - Standalone AI chat interfaces are criticized as "Clippy-like gimmicks," with calls for embedding AI into existing tools (e.g., @-mentions in collaborative apps).  
   - Demo issues (e.g., broken links, mobile incompatibility on iPhones/Samsung devices) and UI customization limits are noted.

4. **Alternatives & Competition**:  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Deep-Chat and AGIUI/CopilotKit, with debates over open-source vs. proprietary solutions.  
   - Some users advocate for multi-model support (e.g., Claude) to avoid OpenAI lock-in.

5. **Marketing & Strategy**:  
   - References to Joel Spolsky’s "complementary products" strategy, framing ChatKit as a demand-driver for OpenAI’s core APIs.  
   - Critiques of OpenAI’s marketing approach (e.g., lack of screenshots/docs) and SEO concerns over the "ChatKit" name.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious interest tempered by skepticism about costs, lock-in, and practicality, with developers seeking flexibility, transparency, and seamless integration into existing workflows.

### Launch HN: Grapevine (YC S19) – A company GPT that actually works

#### [Submission URL](https://getgrapevine.ai/) | 72 points | by [eambutu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eambutu) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45492564)

Grapevine pitches itself as a working “company GPT” that finds and answers questions across internal knowledge—docs, code, and communication—so you don’t have to. The core experience is a Slack bot you can connect in ~30 minutes, start querying within an hour, and supposedly have full historical context within a couple of days, improving over time. The landing page shows internal Slack threads (e.g., infra/S3 bucket requests) and claims >85% of answers are “helpful & accurate” based on hundreds of beta questions.

Notable details:
- Interface: Slack-first; “watch demo” and free start.
- Claims: Learns over time; answers with sources; handles historical context.
- Security: AES‑256 encryption at rest, isolated per-customer databases, SOC 2 Type 2; “will not train models on your data.”
- Positioning: Alternative to DIY company GPTs and pricier enterprise assistants.

What HN will ask:
- Integrations and permissions: Which sources are supported? Does it enforce source ACLs? Audit logs?
- Reliability: How is “85% accurate” measured? Hallucination handling and citations?
- Deployment: SaaS vs. self-hosted/VPC, data residency, SSO/SCIM.
- Pricing: What “get started for free” includes and enterprise costs.
- Performance: Indexing latency, freshness, and how it handles codebases at scale.

Overall: Another entrant in the internal knowledge assistant space, with a clean Slack workflow and strong security posture claims; details on evals, integrations, and pricing will decide adoption.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Grapevine:**

**Key Themes:**  
1. **Self-Hosting & Security:**  
   - Strong interest in self-hosting options, particularly from German businesses cautious about data privacy and compliance with EU laws. Concerns raised about data exfiltration risks and the practicality of LAN security measures (e.g., MITM decryption, USB keyloggers).  
   - Grapevine’s SOC 2 compliance, per-customer data isolation, and encryption were noted, but skepticism remains about trusting third-party SaaS for sensitive internal knowledge.  

2. **Accuracy & Metrics:**  
   - Debate over the claim that “85% of answers are helpful & accurate.” Questions arose about how this metric is measured (e.g., combined helpfulness/accuracy vs. separate scores). Some users called the statistic vague or “intentionally downplayed marketing.”  

3. **Technical Implementation:**  
   - Praise for Grapevine’s Slack-first design and citation features (sources linked to answers) but requests for details on:  
     - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation** and handling of hallucinations.  
     - Integrations (e.g., SharePoint, codebases) and access-control enforcement (ACLs).  
     - Handling large files (e.g., 4GB PowerPoints, 200k+ PDFs) and latency at scale.  

4. **Market Positioning:**  
   - Seen as a compelling alternative to DIY internal GPTs, but questions about target customers. Grapevine’s focus appears to be on enterprises needing out-of-the-box solutions rather than companies with existing knowledge-management systems.  
   - Concerns about vendor lock-in and data retention policies, especially when using third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI).  

5. **Competitors & Alternatives:**  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Onyxapp (self-hosted), Open Web, and Gather (a deprecated tool). Users highlighted the importance of simplicity and ease of setup (e.g., Docker deployment).  

**Notable Criticisms:**  
- **Data Control:** Skepticism about SaaS models vs. self-hosted/VPC deployments, with demands for AWS/Azure integration and clearer data residency options.  
- **Enterprise Realities:** Challenges in regulated industries (e.g., handling sales contracts, production plans) and executive reluctance to trust AI with critical data.  
- **Cost:** Questions about pricing tiers, with free-tier limitations and enterprise costs unstated.  

**Positive Feedback:**  
- Early adopters reported success with Grapevine’s ability to answer cross-team questions and reduce time spent searching documents.  
- Slack integration and rapid setup (~30 minutes) were praised as user-friendly.  

**Final Takeaway:**  
Grapevine’s Slack-centric approach and security claims are strengths, but adoption hinges on transparent metrics, granular access controls, and flexibility for privacy-conscious enterprises. The discussion reflects broader HN skepticism toward AI accuracy and SaaS data handling, balanced by enthusiasm for tools that genuinely reduce internal knowledge friction.

### Why do LLMs freak out over the seahorse emoji?

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/) | 709 points | by [nyxt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nyxt) | [395 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487044)

- The claim: Ask today’s top models if a seahorse emoji exists and they confidently say yes. But Unicode has no seahorse emoji (a proposal was rejected in 2018). There’s also a human “Mandela effect”: lots of posts and comments insist it used to exist.

- Why the false certainty: Two likely sources:
  1) Training-data echoes of those human claims.
  2) Reasonable generalization: so many sea creatures are in Unicode that “seahorse” feels statistically inevitable.

- Why the weird behavior: When prompted to actually output it, models don’t have a true “seahorse” token to land on. A logit-lens pass over Llama 3.3-70B shows the model iteratively steers through “horse/sea/seah…” and then grabs nearby emoji tokens (often fish) as the best available neighbors in token space. Tokenizer quirks make this visible as odd fragments like “ĠðŁ / Ĳ / ł,” which are just byte-pair pieces of an emoji.

- What the logit lens shows: Inspecting intermediate layers, the top-next-token drifts from word fragments (horse/sea) toward “closest viable emoji,” culminating in a fish emoji. You can even see other nearby clusters (e.g., Scorpio), suggesting the model is exploring the emoji neighborhood it “expects” seahorse to occupy.

- Why it turns into emoji spam: The model’s strong prior (“there is a seahorse emoji”) collides with a closed vocabulary where it doesn’t exist. Under pressure to satisfy the prompt, it keeps sampling adjacent tokens, producing wrong emojis and sometimes looping.

- Takeaways:
  - LLMs start each context with priors that can be confidently wrong, especially about fixed ontologies (Unicode, country lists, airport codes).
  - When correctness depends on a closed set, models need grounding: check against a list, cite code points, or use a tool to validate.
  - The logit lens is a simple but revealing way to watch a belief get refined—and sometimes derailed—across layers.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around LLMs' inaccuracies (e.g., the nonexistent "seahorse emoji") and broader implications of their behavior. Key themes include:

1. **Anthropomorphism and Ethics**:  
   - Debate over whether LLMs "lie" or "hallucinate." Critics argue anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., calling errors "lies") is misleading, as LLMs lack intent or moral agency. Others counter that human-like framing helps communicate risks, especially to vulnerable users.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Users**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs amplifying misinformation for mentally disturbed individuals or conspiracy theorists. Analogies to SCP-314 (a fictional "reality-altering" entity) highlight fears of models reinforcing false beliefs, similar to the Mandela effect.  
   - Skeptics dismiss these risks as overblown, attributing errors to technical limitations rather than malice.

3. **Technical Limitations vs. Deception**:  
   - LLMs’ false claims (like the seahorse emoji) stem from training data echoes, tokenization quirks, and statistical guessing—not intent. The debate questions whether terms like "hallucination" obscure or clarify these mechanics.

4. **Moral Implications**:  
   - A subthread compares LLM inaccuracies to human lying, asking if developers bear responsibility for harm caused by outputs. Critics reject this analogy, emphasizing AI’s lack of consciousness.

5. **Dismissals and Humor**:  
   - Some users mock the seriousness of the topic (e.g., joking about ergonomic copyediting desks or referencing Goosebumps books) or downplay risks as overhyped. Others find the conversation relevant to AI safety and user trust.

**Takeaways**:  
While many agree LLMs’ inaccuracies arise from technical flaws, the discussion underscores tensions in how to ethically frame, address, and communicate these issues—particularly for users who may uncritically trust AI outputs. The SCP-314 metaphor and arguments over "lying" vs. "hallucinating" reflect deeper anxieties about AI’s role in shaping perception of reality.

### OpenAI DevDay 2025: Opening keynote [video]

#### [Submission URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c) | 55 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493432)

The HN link resolves to a bare YouTube page that shows nothing but the site’s global footer: About, Press, Copyright, Contact, Creators, Advertise, Developers, Terms, Privacy, Policy & Safety, How YouTube works, Test new features, an NFL Sunday Ticket promo, and © 2025 Google LLC. In other words, the actual content is missing—likely removed, private, or otherwise inaccessible—leaving only boilerplate. It’s a tidy snapshot of link rot on platform-locked content: when the page goes, all that remains is the corporate chrome.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the broken YouTube link submission:

**Key Themes**:  
1. **Link Rot & Platform Dependency**: Users lamented the fragility of platform-hosted content, noting how corporate-controlled platforms leave little trace when content is removed (e.g., YouTube’s bare footer). Simon Willison linked to [a blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct6/openai-dvdy-lv-blg/) discussing this issue.  

2. **AI Model Speculation**:  
   - Comments debated OpenAI’s Codex CLI/Cloud updates (GA release on Oct 20) and GPT-5’s rumored capabilities, with users questioning whether API benchmarks truly reflect "GPT-5 Pro" reasoning.  
   - Skepticism arose about corporate transparency, with comparisons to "Entropix 0.0" (a fictional reference) and claims that OpenAI might obscure model details.  

3. **Meta’s Live Demo Mishap**: A subthread humorously speculated that Meta’s live demo failure (likely an unreferenced event) avoided embarrassment by cutting content short, with jabs at Twitter’s role in amplifying tech drama.  

4. **Accessibility Note**: One user requested a transcript of the (inaccessible) YouTube video, highlighting the importance of text alternatives.  

**Tone**: Mix of technical analysis, cynicism about corporate control of content/AI, and wry humor (e.g., "Terrifying disaster humanity person allowed impact children" – likely a hyperbolic joke). The discussion underscored concerns about digital preservation and opaque AI development practices.
