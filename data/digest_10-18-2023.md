#### [Submission URL](https://www.zdnet.com/article/how-almalinux-stays-red-hat-enterprise-linux-compatible-without-red-hat-code/) | 62 points | by [CrankyBear](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CrankyBear) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37935375)

AlmaLinux, an open-source project, is tackling the challenge of creating a Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone without using any RHEL code. This comes after Red Hat changed their rules on the usage of RHEL code in other Linux distributions, leaving RHEL clone distributions in a difficult position. While some distributions have opted to find alternative methods to incorporate RHEL code, AlmaLinux has taken a different route by aiming to be Application Binary Interface (ABI) compatible with RHEL. They are achieving this by leveraging the CentOS Stream codebase, which Red Hat continues to offer to the open-source community. While this approach has its challenges, including the need for manual patching of certain packages, AlmaLinux has been able to release upstream security fixes faster than Red Hat. The overall goal is to maintain RHEL compatibility and address any breaking changes between RHEL and AlmaLinux as bugs that need to be fixed. AlmaLinux also plans to add features of its own while ensuring that the software remains distinct from EPEL and RHEL. Despite the difficulties, AlmaLinux remains optimistic and is preparing for any potential disruptions that Red Hat may introduce. They are set to release beta versions of AlmaLinux 8, 9, and 9.3 soon after the release of RHEL 8.9 and 9.3.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clone distributions and the challenges they face. Some users express their confusion about Red Hat's policies and why they are cracking down on RHEL clones. Others argue that Red Hat's actions are within their rights as per the GPL license and that they are just protecting their commercial interests. There is also a debate about Richard Stallman's stance on GPL and whether the FSF should intervene in Red Hat's actions. Some users criticize Red Hat for allegedly exploiting the work done by the community and not giving back enough, while others defend Red Hat's practices. The discussion also touches on the role of Rocky Linux and its attempt to create a RHEL clone while maintaining a clear distinction from RHEL. Overall, there is a mix of opinions on the topic, with some supporting Red Hat's actions and others questioning their motives.

The post emphasized the need for awareness of this vulnerability when designing large language models (LLMs) and mentioned that OpenAI and Microsoft are actively researching ways to protect against such attacks.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of prompt injection and its implications. Here are some key points:

- Some users discuss the distinction between prompt injection in large language models (LLMs) and jailbreaking. Prompt injection involves injecting a malicious text prompt into an LLM to manipulate its behavior, while jailbreaking bypasses restrictions in accessing and modifying an LLM.
- The length of the context provided to an LLM is debated, with one user suggesting that context length affects prompt injection vulnerabilities.
- Users mention previous discussions on multi-model prompt injection attacks and the need for measures to detect and prevent such attacks.
- The concept of explicit rule-based behavior in traditional software systems is compared to the Implicit Alignment problem in LLMs, where the model's behavior relies on the context and assumptions of human-generated prompts.
- The importance of validating and confirming external inputs to LLMs to prevent prompt injection attacks is emphasized.
- Some users draw parallels between prompt injection and SQL injection, highlighting the need for addressing vulnerabilities through patching and solving the underlying alignment issues.

Overall, the discussion expands on the vulnerabilities and implications of prompt injection in LLMs, highlighting the need for further research and safeguards in building and using these models.
