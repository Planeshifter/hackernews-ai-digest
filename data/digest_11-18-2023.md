### I disagree with Geoff Hinton regarding "glorified autocomplete"

#### [Submission URL](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/11/18/i-disagree-with-geoff-hinton-regarding-glorified-autocomplete/) | 187 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [240 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38320698)

The "godfather of AI," Geoff Hinton, believes that chatbots, often dismissed as glorified autocomplete, actually possess a deeper level of understanding. By training them to predict the next word, they are forced to comprehend the context. This idea resonates with the author, who finds themselves providing "glorified autocomplete" in meetings. They act as a sort of FAQ, connecting ideas and offering insights. While shallow responses can be effective, there comes a point where deep thinking is required. This is akin to the difference between jogging and running, with the latter demanding more concentration. The author also notices this pattern during talks and observations of others. It seems to align with psychology's theories of associative and logical reasoning, with intuition being fast and automatic, while reasoning involves conscious judgments and attitudes. However, the author's "glorified autocomplete" thinking requires more intention and is not purely automatic.

The discussion in the comments revolves around different interpretations and opinions on the capabilities and limitations of Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Some users argue that LLMs do not possess true understanding or consciousness, while others point out that they are trained to generate responses based on patterns in training data rather than having a literal understanding. There is also a discussion on the distinction between conceptually true and false answers and how LLMs handle them. One user debunked the misconception that LLMs have self-knowledge or consciousness, explaining that they rely on patterns in training data for generating responses. Additionally, there is a debate about the relevance and accuracy of LLMs in representing the real world and the extent to which they understand it. Some users argue that LLMs are fundamentally incomplete in their representation of the world, while others believe they can accurately model certain aspects. Finally, there is a discussion on the limitations of modeling consciousness and deliberate processes in LLMs and the potential misunderstanding of their capabilities.
