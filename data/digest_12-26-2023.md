#### [Submission URL](https://vram.asmirnov.xyz/) | 128 points | by [furiousteabag](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=furiousteabag) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38774026)

The VRAM Estimator is a handy tool that allows you to estimate the memory usage of transformer-based models on GPUs. Whether you're running inference or training, this tool can give you insights into how much VRAM your model will consume.

To make use of the estimator, you'll need to input various parameters such as precision, optimizer, sequence length, batch size, number of GPUs, model parameters, number of layers, vocab size, hidden size, number of attention heads, intermediate size, and number of key-value heads. The tool then provides you with an estimation of the VRAM usage.

For example, if you input the parameters and run the estimator, it might tell you that the total VRAM usage is 27836 MiB. It breaks down the usage into different components such as CUDA kernels, parameters, activations, gradients, first moments, and output tensors, giving you a detailed understanding of how each component contributes to the overall VRAM usage.

It's important to note that these estimates might not be 100% precise, but they provide a good understanding of the VRAM requirements based on the current understanding of the topic. If you want a more thorough explanation and access to the calculation code, you can check out the detailed post and the source repository. And if you spot any issues or have suggestions, you can reach out to the developer via email or create an issue/PR in the repository.

So if you're working with transformer-based models and need to estimate VRAM usage, give the VRAM Estimator a try and optimize your GPU memory usage. Cheers!

### DreamCoder: Growing Generalizable, Interpretable Knowledge

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381) | 80 points | by [fbodz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fbodz) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38767815)

A group of researchers has developed a system called DreamCoder that learns to solve problems by writing programs. The system creates programming languages and neural networks to guide the search for programs within these languages. Using a "wake-sleep" learning algorithm, the system extends the language with new symbolic abstractions and trains the neural network on imagined and replayed problems. DreamCoder is capable of solving both classic inductive programming tasks and creative tasks such as drawing pictures and building scenes. It has even rediscovered concepts such as modern functional programming, vector algebra, and classical physics. The system's concepts are built compositionally from those learned earlier, resulting in interpretable and transferrable symbolic representations. DreamCoder demonstrates the potential of growing generalizable and interpretable knowledge through wake-sleep Bayesian program learning.

The discussion surrounding the submission revolves around several different topics. 

One user, "nmsk," expresses their opinion that building hierarchical abstractions is essential for true artificial intelligence that can go beyond complete tasks. They believe that DreamCoder demonstrates the potential of hierarchical abstractions and has the ability to create complex descriptions of tasks.

In response to this, user "rmrm" questions the existence of hierarchical coding in AI systems, suggesting that it is difficult to achieve due to the limitations of current programming languages and libraries.

User "Nevermark" shares their belief that coding models should aim to make humans more capable and that AI abstractions can be useful. They also mention that simpler tasks are easier to tackle, while more complex tasks are more competitively challenging.

Another user, "mrkrsn," adds that DreamCoder is an AI system that creates abstractions.

In a separate comment, user "mdnl" shares their disappointment that some supplementary materials related to DreamCoder are not accessible, but they provide links to GitHub repositories.

User "ndnfrth" simply states "2020," without providing further context or explanation.

Lastly, user "yrprfct" asks about the exploration-exploitation pattern in DreamCoder's wake-sleep algorithm, comparing it to deep reinforcement learning.

### Burger King turns hangovers into discounts with facial recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://www.marketingdive.com/news/burger-king-hangover-facial-recognition-app-campaign/703187/) | 19 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38775400)

Burger King in Brazil has launched a campaign called "Hangover Whopper" that provides discounts on the brand's sandwiches to hungover consumers. The campaign uses facial recognition technology to scan a consumer's face and detect the degree of their hangover, offering a corresponding combo coupon for the Whopper Jr. Double, Whopper, or Whopper Double. The selfies taken during the process can also be shared on social media. Burger King has a history of using creative mobile technology campaigns to drive engagement and increase traffic to its app and restaurants. This campaign, created in partnership with agency DM9, runs through January 2nd and is available only for BK Delivery.

The discussion surrounding Burger King's "Hangover Whopper" campaign on Hacker News covers a range of topics. 

One user points out that Burger King has faced challenges in Russia and Ukraine, with hundreds of its major international franchises having to leave these countries. Another user shares a personal anecdote about their experience with Burger King's breakfast promotion. They recall being disappointed after walking into Burger King for a breakfast burger only to be told they had to wait until 9 am to order one. Eventually, they were offered a 2-for-1 happy hour deal.

The discussion then moves towards the marketing tactics of Burger King, with one user sarcastically commenting on the "new ways" they find to exploit consumers. Another user feels that the campaign is not realistic and points out that facial recognition technology is not always accurate.

Further comments criticize the campaign for incentivizing people to drink excessively and then consume fast food. One user mentions that this campaign is not the best idea considering it runs until January 2nd, right after New Year's Day, which is known for its hangovers. Another user jokingly suggests not serving people who are hungover.

Lastly, there are a few unrelated comments; one user mentions that they are in Brazil, where the campaign is being run, and another user simply states, "I'm flying to Brazil."

### OpenAI Pissed Off Developers by Phasing Out Plugins for GPTs

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/openai-pissed-off-developers-by-phasing-out-plugins-for-1851124124) | 49 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38773147)

OpenAI's recent email to plugin developers has caused some controversy. The company asked developers to switch from building plugins to building GPTs, which has upset many developers who prefer the functionality of plugins. Although OpenAI claims that plugins are not going away yet, they anticipate that most developers will eventually move to GPTs once the GPT Store goes live. The developer community feels that plugins are crucial for the development and progress of AI applications. OpenAI's move towards more consumer-friendly GPTs may ostracize the developer community, which is essential for building good GPTs. This is not the first time OpenAI has upset developers, as an earlier update to ChatGPT rendered many developers' products useless. OpenAI's focus on GPTs may be due to security concerns surrounding plugins. However, there are limitations with GPTs that make developers less enthusiastic about building them. OpenAI's approach seems to prioritize appealing to everyday consumers rather than developers, similar to Apple's approach of offering cleaner products with fewer ports. However, OpenAI needs developers to build useful AI applications to succeed.

Discussion Summary:

- One commenter mentioned that OpenAI's recent decision to migrate from plugins to GPTs has caused frustration among developers. They highlighted the importance of plugins for AI applications and expressed concerns about the limitations of GPTs.
- Another commenter pointed out that OpenAI's terms of service for plugins were not very clear, and some developers were unsure about what was allowed. They suggested that OpenAI should have encouraged custom system prompts and sandboxing with GPTs to improve functionality.
- A user mentioned that the sentiment toward plugins has been negative in recent months due to issues with latency and discovery. They argued that OpenAI's focus on the API and functional calls with GPTs may be a more efficient approach.
- One commenter noted that they have heard little about developers liking plugins and have seen many posts from companies praising OpenAI's decision. They speculate that developers may not be the target audience for OpenAI's products.
- Another user disagreed, stating that GPTs do not offer the same functionality as plugins, such as custom instructions and file handling. They argued that plugins could work alongside GPTs.
- One commenter explained that the reason OpenAI created GPTs was to generate synthetic data for training models, which leads to better quality results. They provided an estimate of the amount of data used and its impact on training.
- A user suggested that custom system prompts and sandboxing should be considered as external APIs and not be built externally.
- Lastly, a commenter expressed their dislike for negativity in the discussion.
