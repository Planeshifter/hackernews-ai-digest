#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/DiscoGrad/DiscoGrad) | 221 points | by [frankling_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=frankling_) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40481578)

DiscoGrad is a tool that aims to solve the challenge of obtaining useful gradients for programs involving both parameter-dependent branching control flow and randomness. Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a popular technique for obtaining gradients, but it often yields unhelpful gradients for such complex programs. DiscoGrad automatically transforms C++ programs to efficiently calculate smoothed gradients across branches, supporting smoothing via external perturbations if needed. The tool includes several gradient estimation backends and the option to integrate neural networks via Torch. While supporting basic C++ constructs, DiscoGrad is still a research prototype. The repository includes sample applications from various domains like transportation, crowd management, and epidemiology.

Users can get started by compiling the transformation code using clang and llvm, then using the provided sample programs for reference. The tool allows for running smoothed programs and computing gradients using different backends, providing a more useful derivative than traditional AD for optimization purposes. With DiscoGrad, users can address the challenges of obtaining meaningful gradients for C++ programs involving branching control flow and randomness, opening up possibilities for end-to-end training scenarios combining gradients with neural networks.

The discussion on the submission "DiscoGrad - Automatically Differentiate Across Conditional Branches in C++ Programs" on Hacker News covered various aspects of the tool and its implications:

1. Users discussed the challenges of obtaining meaningful gradients for C++ programs involving branching control flow and randomness. Participants mentioned the importance of addressing local minima and the benefits of smooth gradients for optimization purposes.
2. Some users pointed out the potential applications of DiscoGrad in domains like transportation engineering, highlighting the significance of addressing non-smooth optimization problems in such scenarios.
3. There was a conversation about the benefits and limitations of DiscoGrad in delivering useful gradients and information on the local behavior of cost functions. The tool's capability to prevent getting stuck in undesired local minima and the challenges of enhancing global minimum identification were discussed.
4. A user brought up the connection between differentiable programming and programming language design, emphasizing the role of differentiable languages in identifying optimal policies using gradients.
5. A separate discussion touched upon the complexities of reinforcement learning policies, optimal control, and the challenges of generalization in RL within the context of program synthesis.
6. Some users shared insights into Bayesian modeling, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), and the limitations of gradient descent in certain scenarios. Understanding Monte Carlo simulations and the implications of high-dimensional jumps were highlighted.
7. The conversation also extended to other related tools and technologies such as Tapenade for automatic differentiation, differentiable physics simulations using languages like Julia, and the integration of DiscoGrad with existing frameworks for improved performance and flexibility.
8. A user shared a historical tidbit about a Soviet project called Discograd, mentioning its influence on global popular music and its transformation post-1991.

Overall, the discussions on the submission covered technical aspects of gradient descent in C++ programs, implications for optimization across branches, potential applications in various domains, and historical references to related projects.

### To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language (2020)

#### [Submission URL](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) | 272 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [188 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40480913)

Neuroscientists from MIT have discovered that reading computer code does not engage the brain's language-processing centers, but rather activates a general-purpose brain network called the multiple demand network. This network, responsible for complex cognitive tasks like solving math problems, is not the same as the language network. The study suggests that understanding computer code is a unique cognitive process distinct from language and math. By analyzing brain activity while participants read code in Python and ScratchJr, the researchers found minimal involvement of language regions and stronger activation of the multiple demand network. This sheds light on how the brain processes coding differently from other cognitive tasks.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about neuroscientists from MIT discovering that reading computer code engages a general-purpose brain network called the multiple demand network rather than the language-processing centers raised several interesting points. Some users discussed the similarities between reading code and engaging in tasks like solving math problems or reading stories, suggesting that the process involves understanding complex relationships and structures. There was also a comparison made between literate programming and traditional programming languages, highlighting the benefits of incorporating a storytelling aspect into code documentation. Additionally, some users talked about how reading code activates different cognitive processes compared to reading natural languages and the importance of understanding the higher-level principles behind code rather than focusing on individual details. Discussions also touched upon the differences in how compilers understand code compared to humans and the challenges of translating between different languages. Overall, the conversation explored the unique cognitive processes involved in understanding and working with computer code.

### Apple signs deal with OpenAI for iOS, still wants Google as an 'option'
