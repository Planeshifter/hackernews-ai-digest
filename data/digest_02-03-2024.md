Software development tool maker JetBrains is facing backlash from some of its customers over its AI assistant plugin. The AI assistant, which was introduced in December, is deeply integrated into JetBrains' development environments, code editors, and other products. However, some developers are unhappy with the plugin and want it completely removed from their applications. Concerns raised by developers include the potential risks to security, legal issues, privacy, ethics, and corporate intellectual property. Users argue that the plugin is "bloatware" and a breach of trust. In response, JetBrains has clarified that the AI functionality is not enabled by default and no data is sent off-machine without the users' consent. The company is also exploring options to make the assistant fully removable.

The discussion surrounding JetBrains' AI assistant plugin on Hacker News is varied, with users expressing mixed opinions on the issue. Some users argue that developers should have read and accepted the privacy policy before using the plugin, while others express frustration with paying a subscription fee for a plugin they did not explicitly sign up for. There is also debate around the potential risks and ethical implications of the AI assistant, with concerns raised about security, privacy, and the collection of user data. Some users question the trustworthiness of corporations and express skepticism towards AI technology in general. Additionally, there are discussions about other bundled plugins, and some users mention cases where similar AI plugins were enabled by default. Some users are uncomfortable with the use of AI in their development tools, while others appreciate the added functionality. Overall, the discussion highlights the differing viewpoints and concerns around the AI assistant plugin.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has outlined the company's strategy for competing with Alphabet and Microsoft in the AI space. Speaking on Meta's earnings call, Zuckerberg highlighted Meta's advantage: its vast collection of publicly shared images and videos. While competitors like Google and Microsoft rely on web data crawled by their search engines, Meta has access to a unique walled garden of data. Zuckerberg also emphasized Meta's ambition to develop "general intelligence," a concept referring to a general-purpose AI that can outperform humans in most tasks. To achieve this, Meta plans to invest heavily in AI research and development, with estimated capital expenditures of up to $37 billion this year. Meta's stock rose 14.5% after the announcement.

The discussion surrounding this submission on Hacker News covers various aspects of Meta's strategy and its implications for the future. Here are some key points from the comments:
1. One user expresses excitement about Meta's release of the OpenAI patent access, suggesting that it will contribute to the advancement of generative AI technologies.
2. Another user refers to an article discussing the potential of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and the Metaverse, highlighting the significance of Meta's strategy in that context.
3. A comment provides a link to another submission on Hacker News, which discusses Meta's financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023.
4. The mention of "gmntd rlty str" (presumably referring to augmented reality) sparks interest, as it aligns with Meta's focus on developing advanced technologies beyond just AI.
5. One user simply comments "true," which doesn't offer much context to understand their viewpoint.
Overall, the comments highlight the potential impact of Meta's strategy on the AI landscape and the broader technology industry. There is a sense of optimism about Meta's investment in AI research and development, as well as its focus on the Metaverse and augmented reality.
