### Rickroll meme immortalized in custom ASIC that includes 164 hardcoded programs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/04/01/rickroll_meme_asic/) | 81 points | by [iamflimflam1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iamflimflam1) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39914478)

In a quirky twist that's been immortalized in silicon, the iconic Rickroll meme has now become a starring feature of a custom ASIC that incorporates a whopping total of 164 hardcoded programs. This whimsical creation is the brainchild of Matthew Venn's Zero to ASIC Course, an initiative that empowers chip engineering enthusiasts to craft their own ASIC designs and see them come to life. The ASIC, part of the Tiny Tapeout project, houses various designs ranging from a persistence-of-vision controller to a graphics processor that renders a miniaturized Rick Astley's "Never Gonna Give You Up" music video—a classic internet favorite.

The journey to bring this meme to life on silicon was not without its challenges, notably the need to compress the video file to fit within the chip's constraints, resulting in a retro Atari 2600-like output. Despite these limitations, the ASIC successfully showcases the Rickroll GIF through a VGA display, thanks to the ingenuity of the designer, Bitluni. Beyond the Rickroll, the Tiny Tapeout 2 chip boasts an array of other playful designs, including an FPGA, a 4-bit CPU, and a pi-estimating calculator, demonstrating the creative potential of aspiring chip designers. 

Although these designs may not serve practical purposes, they offer valuable learning opportunities and proof of concept for those venturing into the realm of chip design. The ASIC, crafted through the Efabless's ChipIgnite program, utilizes the Skywater 130nm open-source PDK, making it an accessible platform for experimentation and exploration in the field. Despite the course's higher price tag compared to FPGA alternatives, the opportunity to see one's designs materialize in physical silicon remains a unique and enriching experience.

Looking ahead, the next iterations of the Tiny Tapeout project are already in the pipeline, promising more inventive designs and technological marvels to come. With previous submissions hinting at future meme-inspired creations and quirky AI decelerators, the world of custom ASICs continues to be a fertile ground for innovation and imagination. So, if you've ever dreamt of seeing your digital creations etched into silicon, the Zero to ASIC Course might just be the gateway to turning those dreams into tangible realities.

### Opera becomes the first major browser with built-in access to local AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://press.opera.com/2024/04/03/ai-feature-drops-local-llms/) | 97 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [126 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39916439)

Today, Opera made a groundbreaking announcement by introducing experimental support for 150 local LLM variants from around 50 families of models in its Opera One browser. This feature enables users to access and manage local AI models directly within the browser, a first-of-its-kind integration in a major browser. By leveraging Local Large Language Models, users can benefit from generative AI capabilities without compromising their data privacy, as the information is stored locally on their devices.

The rollout of local LLMs is part of Opera's AI Feature Drops Program, allowing early adopters to test these innovative features in the developer stream of Opera One. Users can select their preferred model for processing input, which will then be downloaded to their device, requiring 2-10 GB of local storage per variant. This advancement positions Opera as a pioneer in exploring the potential of local AI technologies and building experiences within the rapidly growing local AI space.

Opera's commitment to innovation in the AI realm was previously demonstrated with the launch of Opera One, a browser centered around AI capabilities, and the introduction of Aria, the browser's native AI assistant. Through these initiatives, Opera has established itself as a trailblazer in integrating AI into browsing experiences. To test the local LLMs in Opera One Developer, users can access the feature through the provided link on Opera's website.

Opera is renowned for its user-centric and innovative approach to software development, aiming to enhance internet browsing experiences across various devices. With millions of users globally, Opera continues to push boundaries in browser technology and AI integration.

The discussion on the submission about Opera's announcement of integrating 150 local LLM variants into their browser included various viewpoints and topics:

- Some comments raised concerns about the relevance of local AI models in the browser interface and whether they are necessary for completing tasks.
- Others discussed the preference for dedicated services over local interfaces and the potential use cases, such as web browsers with interactive extensions like JavaScript, Emacs, and Elisp.
- There were comments about the functionality of browsers like Sheets and Gmail, with suggestions for features like financial password storage in HTTP headers.
- Users also mentioned the historical context of browsers bundling additional features like email clients, calendar apps, and BitTorrent clients, with references to Opera's past developments and comparisons to Vivaldi.
- Additional discussions touched on topics like AI-driven content generation, language translation features in Firefox, and the strategic direction of various browsers like Opera and Mozilla.

Overall, the conversation highlighted diverse opinions on the integration of local AI models in web browsers, comparisons between different browser functionalities, and reflections on the history of browser development.

### Annin Robotics AR4, open plan low cost 6DOF desktop industrial robot

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anninrobotics.com) | 17 points | by [danboarder](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danboarder) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39914142)

The Annin Robotics AR4 robot is making waves as a free and open-source 6DOF desktop industrial robot. Designed for easy assembly using either aluminum components or 3D-printed parts, this robot is gaining popularity in small automation processes as well as educational and hobbyist communities. You can access the 3D print files, operating software, and assembly manuals for free on their downloads page, while aluminum parts and hardware kits are available for purchase. The AR series aims to make 6-axis robot arms accessible for fun projects, education, or small-scale production. Powered by an Arduino-based Teensy 4.1 control board and free Python control software, the AR4 robot arm is also compatible with RoboDK software. Looking ahead, the focus is on enhancing software features and functionality to offer the most cost-effective solution for real-world tasks. An excellent initiative for robotics enthusiasts of all levels!

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of the Annin Robotics AR4 robot. 

- **From user "Animats":** The user emphasizes the limitations of the stepper motor drivers and lack of fundamental features in the robot's design. They argue that brushless motors, especially those with good controllers, offer better performance in terms of power-to-weight ratios, cost, and efficiency. They compare the Annin Robotics AR4 with other lower-cost robotic arms available on platforms like Alibaba.

- **User "snps" counters:** They discuss the advantages of brushless motors, highlighting their high kV ratings, speed capabilities, and suitability for certain applications like gimbal motors. They also mention larger versions available with built-in controllers for greater precision and reduced backlash in conventional robotic arms.

- **User "ncmcchrn" adds:** They point out that the absence of gearboxes in the design of the AR4 affects its performance, citing issues with precision and cost differences attributed to gearboxes.

- **Lastly, user "zttbmb" comments:** They appreciate the project by Annin Robotics but note some shortcomings in the design, suggesting the need for more refined and professional designs on platforms like GitHub.

In summary, the discussion delves into the technical aspects and potential improvements of the AR4 robot, highlighting the advantages of brushless motors over steppers, the importance of gearboxes for performance, and suggestions for enhancing the overall design of the robotic arm.
