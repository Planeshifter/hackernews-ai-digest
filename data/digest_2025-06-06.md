Welcome to the fascinating world of gradient noise! If you've ever been captivated by intricate landscapes in video games or the hypnotic undulations of mathematics-based art, you've likely encountered the magical tool known as Perlin noise. This particular form of gradient noise is widely revered and utilized across visual effects, gaming, and procedural art for its ability to seamlessly generate textures and patterns.

The beauty of gradient noise lies not only in its versatility but also in its forgiving nature. Even when implementations are slightly "off," the results can still appear aesthetically pleasing—after all, as many artists will attest, if it looks good, then it's good!

To truly uncover the depths of this phenomenon, we embark on a journey starting with a comprehensive study of the 1D version of gradient noise—a dimension often overlooked in technical literature. As we delve deeper, we'll expand our exploration to more complex, multi-dimensional formats. Our focus will be on GPU-based implementations, with all our code examples crafted in WebGL2/GLSL for a smoother, modern performance.

Central to generating effective gradient noise is the creation of a deterministic pseudo-random system, particularly in the context of a GPU where conventional CPU methods such as permutation tables are less efficient. This requires us to employ an effective integer hashing mechanism. Enter the unsung hero of the day, Chris Wellons’ refined lowbias32 hash function, which, along with its GLSL adaptation, helps transform 32-bit integers into usable pseudo-random values for generating noise.

By creatively combining hashing functions across dimensions and exploring various interpolation techniques, we establish the basis of an awe-inspiring noise function. The result? Deterministic, seekable, and exquisitely smooth noise that opens doors to infinite creative possibilities.

For those who dare to delve beyond the surface, this exploration promises an enlightening experience filled with learning and discovery. So whether you're a coder, artist, or both, this detailed dive into the world of gradient noise provides the tools and understanding to push the boundaries of your creations.

### How much energy does it take to think?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-think-20250604/) | 73 points | by [nsoonhui](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nsoonhui) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44197961)

Have you ever felt utterly exhausted after a day of intense thinking, only to flop on the couch hoping to switch off your brain? Well, your brain isn’t ready to take a break just yet. According to fascinating new research highlighted by Quanta Magazine, our brain's energy consumption barely changes between high-focus tasks and periods of rest. Neuroscientist Sharna Jamadar and her colleagues dove into neural metabolism to discover that intricate background processes keep our minds running just as vigorously at rest, using a mere 5% less energy compared to when we are actively engaged in problem-solving.

This surprising efficiency hinges on the brain's role as a regulatory hub rather than just a thinking organ. According to Jordan Theriault from Northeastern University, most of the energy consumed by the brain goes into maintaining vital functions and managing the body's complex systems. Despite making up a tiny portion of our body weight, our brain devours a hefty 20% of our daily energy resources, a fact underscored by the brain’s reliance on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule derived primarily from glucose and oxygen. 

What's more intriguing is how evolution has crafted the brain as an efficient predictor, continually processing and preparing responses to the ever-shifting demands of both our internal and external environments. While active tasks like analyzing a new bus schedule do bump up neuronal activity, this extra workload only adds a small increase to the brain's power consumption.

In short, the next time you feel mentally drained, remember that your brain isn't just earning that energy burn through active thought—it’s tirelessly running a hidden, intricate operation to keep you ready for anything life throws your way. So, take a break with the comfort of knowing that even while resting, your brain is still hard at work.

The Hacker News discussion on the brain's energy consumption reveals a blend of personal anecdotes, technical insights, and speculative ideas. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Mental vs. Physical Fatigue**:  
   Users debated how mental fatigue differs from physical fatigue. While physical endurance can be trained, mental exhaustion—like after 4–6 hours of focused work—is less understood. Some noted that the brain operates continuously (except during sleep), managing background processes that drain energy even at rest. Slower reaction times, distractibility, and "clumsy" cognition were cited as manifestations of mental fatigue.

2. **Work Type Matters**:  
   Context switching (e.g., meetings, interruptions) and the nature of tasks (rote vs. creative) influence fatigue. Creative or conceptual work (e.g., writing, problem-solving) was described as more draining than routine technical tasks. One user compared prolonged intellectual effort to "running a marathon," requiring recovery periods.

3. **Humor and Substances**:  
   Cocaine was humorously mentioned as a short-term stimulant, though users acknowledged its impracticality and risks. Others joked about "overclocking" the brain, likening it to ADHD or risky CPU tuning, while noting the brain’s limited energy efficiency gains from such efforts.

4. **Technical Deep Dives**:  
   - The brain’s energy use (20% of baseline metabolism, with only 5% for active thinking) sparked comparisons to software systems "fighting entropy."  
   - Neural firing rates (e.g., 4 Hz baseline vs. 500 Hz peaks) led to discussions about stress-induced "processing bottlenecks" and distributed cognitive timing mechanisms.  
   - Mitochondrial efficiency, inspired by bird migration studies, was highlighted as a factor in energy management.

5. **Anecdotes and Coping**:  
   A developer shared how coding marathons led to sugar cravings, linking it to the brain’s glucose consumption. Others mentioned hydration tricks with sugar-free sodas, though results were mixed.

6. **AI and Future Speculation**:  
   Some pondered whether brain-like predictive efficiency could inspire energy-aware AI algorithms. Others countered that hardware advancements (e.g., ARM chips) already prioritize energy savings, unlike the brain’s biological constraints.

7. **Cautions and Complexity**:  
   Users warned against overinterpreting observational studies about metabolism and life expectancy. The brain’s energy dynamics—balancing maintenance, prediction, and response—were acknowledged as incompletely understood, with calls for deeper research.

In conclusion, the thread underscored fascination with the brain’s hidden workload and its implications for productivity, health, and technology, while recognizing the challenges in translating these insights into practical solutions.

Intriguingly titled "Deep in Mordor where the shadows lie: Dystopian tales of that time when I sold out to Google," this blog post by an unknown former Google employee unfolds like a gripping dystopian narrative. Reflecting on their experiences in the tech giant's labyrinthine corridors during the mid-2000s, the author paints a vivid picture of Google's once glittering image that masked a more complicated reality.

In 2007, Google was the "good guy" in tech, an accolade manifest in their famous tagline "don't be evil" and much-lauded employee benefits like the "20% time," where engineers were supposedly granted a fifth of their time to work on personal projects. Yet, for our narrator, these promises were mere illusions. Overburdened with mundane tasks and underwhelming projects, they describe a high-pressure environment where the much-vaunted free time was essentially a mirage for the majority of employees.

The author bravely exposed this disconnect on Google's internal blogging platform, only to be met with anger from management. The tale spins into an Orwellian satire as they compare their work environment to the dystopian RPG «Paranoia,» where a controlling Computer punishes any sign of dissatisfaction—a metaphor for how Google maintained its "Best Place To Work" facade by silencing dissent.

This thoughtful, provocative narrative critiques the capitalist allurements that lured many into a tech utopia that was, perhaps, more shadowy than it professed. It's a compelling read for anyone intrigued by the interplay of ideals and reality in Silicon Valley's top echelons.

1. **Critique of Workplace Realities**:  
   Many commenters align with the blog’s portrayal of Google’s internal culture, describing it as disillusioning. The “Don’t be evil” motto and perks like “20% time” are seen as superficial, masking a high-pressure environment where dissent is stifled. One user likens Google’s management tactics to *Paranoia*, an RPG where dissenters face punishment, reinforcing an "Orwellian" atmosphere.

2. **Class and Contractor Divide**:  
   Significant attention is paid to the disparity between full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors (TVCs). Contractors are described as “second-class citizens,” denied privileges like access to certain spaces or benefits. Critics argue this deliberate class hierarchy perpetuates division, with one user noting how even trivial perks (e.g., kitchen access) are gatekept to reinforce status differences.

3. **Meritocracy and Engineer Value**:  
   The myth of meritocracy is debated. Some argue engineers are replaceable “cogs,” rewarded with stock options but ultimately expendable. Others counter that software engineers lack leverage compared to sales or marketing roles, with one stating, “Code doesn’t make money; selling code does.”

4. **Pushback and Defense of Google**:  
   A subset of users dismisses the blog as hyperbolic or personal grievance. One critic argues Google’s “Best Place to Work” reputation persists (citing Forbes rankings), while others assert the author’s anarchist leanings might color their critique unrealistically. Another accuses the post of conflating typical corporate bureaucracy with dystopian tropes.

5. **Broader Societal Reflections**:  
   The thread expands into critiques of capitalism, AI’s societal impact, and worker vulnerability. Some commenters mock the irony of privileged programmers dismissing AI’s risks while others highlight systemic issues like corporate dehumanization, drawing parallels to Enron’s collapse.

6. **Semantic Tangents**:  
   Debates occasionally veer into nitpicking, such as whether “anarchists” run Google (dismissed as irrelevant) or semantic disputes over terms like “Orwellian.” These exchanges underscore tensions between literal interpretations and the blog’s allegorical tone.

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of validation and skepticism toward the blog’s claims, emphasizing systemic issues in tech culture—illusory perks, class divides, and critiques of corporate power—while revealing disagreements over how sharply to critique Google versus viewing it as a standard megacorp.
