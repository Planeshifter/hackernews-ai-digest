Scrapscript: A Small, Functional Programming Language

Scrapscript is a new programming language designed for creating small, shareable programs. It is purely functional, content-addressable, and network-first. The language was created by Taylor Troesh, and the main implementation was developed by Max, Chris, and Taylor.

The History of Scrapscript

Max discovered Scrapscript on Hacker News in April 2023 and shared it with Chris, who is a functional programming enthusiast. However, there was no available implementation at the time. After waiting for a while, Max and Chris decided to reach out to Taylor and offer their help. Taylor shared his small JavaScript implementation with them, and Max and Chris started working on their own parallel implementation.

Keeping the Implementation Self-Contained

While Max and Chris didn't aim to minimize the implementation size like Taylor did, they wanted to keep it self-contained. This led to design choices such as avoiding external dependencies and limiting reliance on unique features of the host programming language, in this case, Python. They also focused on thorough testing, including both implementation-level tests and end-to-end tests, to ensure expected behavior.

Python: A Quirky Choice

The decision to use Python for the implementation was mostly due to Max and Chris's familiarity with the language. Python was not chosen for any inherent special qualities, but rather because they had extensive experience with it.

Benefits of Comprehensive Testing

Max and Chris's rigorous testing approach yielded several benefits. They were able to document the expected behavior learned from Taylor's JavaScript implementation and ensure that the ported version matched those expectations. This enabled them to rebuild the implementation with confidence, knowing they weren't breaking anything. Additionally, they were able to introduce new tests and continuously verify that all previous tests passed.

A Familiar Yet Exciting Experience

Despite being a standard tree-walking interpreter for a lambda calculus-based language, Scrapscript was still an exciting project for Max and Chris. It introduced them to features and concepts they hadn't implemented before, like pattern matching. Moreover, it was their first experience of collaboratively building a language implementation from scratch, making it a unique and fulfilling endeavor.

Overall, Scrapscript presents a promising addition to the programming language landscape. Its focus on simplicity, shareability, and functional programming principles makes it stand out from the crowd.

A team of researchers has developed a new image generative model called the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT) that allows for high-resolution image synthesis directly in pixel space. Unlike traditional high-resolution training techniques, HDiT does not require multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders, or self-conditioning. The model leverages the scalability of Transformers while maintaining the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets. The researchers demonstrate that HDiT performs competitively with existing models on ImageNet-2562 and achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-10242. Moreover, HDiT incurs less than 1% of the computational cost compared to the standard diffusion transformer at comparable sizes. The team has provided the generated samples used for FID computation for their models.

The discussion revolves around the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT) model for high-resolution image synthesis. Some users express excitement and ask questions about the model's implementation and potential applications. Others discuss the efficiency and performance of HDiT compared to other models, such as the use of Transformers in diffusion models. There are also discussions about the limitations of user interfaces for large-scale image generation and the trade-offs between computational efficiency and image quality.

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html) | 255 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39109481)

Machine learning has become more accessible in recent years, thanks to online courses, textbooks, and frameworks that abstract away the complexities of building machine learning systems. However, despite these advancements, machine learning still presents challenges. Implementing existing algorithms and models in new applications can be difficult, requiring an understanding of different tools and their trade-offs.

One of the main reasons why machine learning is considered "hard" is due to the debugging process. When something goes wrong with a machine learning algorithm, it can be exponentially harder to identify the issue compared to traditional software engineering. In software engineering, there are typically two dimensions to consider: algorithmic issues and implementation issues. However, in machine learning, there are two additional dimensions: the model and the data.

Debugging in machine learning requires considering issues in algorithm correctness, implementation correctness, data quality, and model limitations. These dimensions create a 4D hypercube of possible bugs, making it challenging to identify the exact problem. Building an intuition for where something went wrong becomes crucial. Fortunately, machine learning algorithms provide additional signals, such as loss function plots and intermediate computation statistics, to help diagnose issues.

Another complicating factor in machine learning debugging is the long debugging cycles. It can take hours or days to see the results of a potential fix. This delay in feedback hampers developer productivity.

In conclusion, while advances have made machine learning more accessible, it remains a difficult problem due to the challenges involved in debugging and the delayed feedback cycles.

The discussion in the comments revolves around the challenges and complexities of debugging in machine learning. Some commenters highlight the difficulty of debugging ML algorithms compared to traditional software engineering. They discuss the need to consider algorithm correctness, data quality, implementation correctness, and model limitations when debugging in machine learning. The long debugging cycles and delayed feedback are also identified as factors that hinder developer productivity in machine learning.

Other commenters mention the importance of experience and expertise in debugging machine learning systems. They suggest that understanding the theoretical motivation behind the models and algorithms is crucial. Some commenters compare debugging in machine learning to other fields, such as electronics, software engineering, and regular scientific research.

The discussion also touches on the challenges of model selection and the interpretation of results in machine learning. Some commenters argue that having a deep understanding of the problem and the data is essential for effective debugging. Others discuss the difficulties of interpreting results in machine learning and the need for expertise and experience in identifying and fixing issues.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity and challenges involved in debugging machine learning systems, and the need for a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms, models, and data.
