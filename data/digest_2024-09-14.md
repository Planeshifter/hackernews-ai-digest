### LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live with This

A new paper titled "LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This" explores the inevitable issue of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by Sourav Banerjee and colleagues. The researchers argue that hallucinations are not merely random mistakes but are rooted in the very mathematical and logical frameworks that underpin LLMs. They assert that no amount of architectural refinements, enhanced datasets, or rigorous fact-checking can fully eradicate this problem. Drawing on principles from computational theory, including Godel's First Incompleteness Theorem, the authors introduce the concept of Structural Hallucination, highlighting that errors are a predictable part of the LLM processing chain and not just an occasional glitch. This thought-provoking analysis urges the AI community to adapt to these limitations rather than aim for their complete elimination.

The discussion surrounding the paper "LLMs Will Always Hallucinate, and We Need to Live With This" delves into the nature of hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) and emphasizes that these are a predictable outcome of LLM design and training. Several commenters highlight that hallucinations aren't random errors but stem from the probabilistic nature of LLM outputs, where the models generate text that sounds plausible but may lack factual correctness.

Key points discussed include:

1. **Hallucinations as Functionality:** Some argue that hallucinations can be seen as an inherent feature rather than a flaw; they suggest this is tied to the models' statistical underpinnings, which rely on generating likely sentences based on training data rather than truth.
2. **Human-like Hallucinations:** Comparisons are made between LLMs and human reasoning, with some commenters noting that humans also exhibit tendencies to generate erroneous beliefs and assumptions. This perspective raises questions about the nature of truth and perception.
3. **Challenges in Verification:** There's an ongoing concern about the ability to verify the outputs of LLMs. Some commenters emphasize the importance of acknowledging this limitation while suggesting that reliance on such models can lead to misinformation if users assume outputs are definitive truths.
4. **Design and Training Dilemmas:** Discussions touch upon the implications of how LLMs are trained, warning against blindly using models without understanding their flaws. Various suggestions revolve around updating training datasets to include verified information and avoiding training on data that may lead to misinformation.
5. **Philosophical Considerations:** Commenters also highlight broader philosophical questions, such as the nature of truth and how humans perceive reality, suggesting that both LLMs and humans can share a propensity for misrepresenting facts.

Overall, the discourse underscores the need for a balanced perspective on the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, advocating for their use with an awareness of their inherent characteristics rather than expecting them to eliminate hallucinations entirely.

### Void captures over a million Android TV boxes

#### [Submission URL](https://news.drweb.com/show/?i=14900) | 157 points | by [Katana_zero](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Katana_zero) | [102 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41536961)

In a startling revelation, Doctor Web has uncovered a massive malware infection affecting nearly 1.3 million Android TV boxes globally, stemming from a malicious backdoor identified as Android.Vo1d. This sophisticated malware exploits vulnerabilities within the devices, allowing attackers to covertly download and install third-party applications.

Detected across 197 countries, the infection particularly hit users in Brazil, Morocco, Pakistan, and several other regions. The malware modifies essential system files, enabling it to auto-launch during device reboots. Key components of Android.Vo1d—like "vo1d" and "wd"—function collaboratively, enabling command and control over infected devices and facilitating the execution of malicious tasks.

The findings serve as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities in seemingly innocuous devices and highlight the importance of vigilant cybersecurity measures for consumers.

In the discussion surrounding the malware infection affecting Android TV boxes, several key themes emerged among users on Hacker News:

1. **Fragmentation of Android Devices**: Participants noted the fragmentation in the Android ecosystem, with many devices not receiving timely updates or security patches. This was highlighted as a significant issue, particularly for users in regions with older hardware or Android versions.
2. **Vulnerabilities in the OEM Model**: Commenters pointed out that manufacturers often lock down devices, limiting software updates and leading to vulnerabilities. This creates a security nightmare, as the lack of consistent support for updates can expose users to malware threats like Android.Vo1d.
3. **Comparison with Other Operating Systems**: Some users compared Android's situation with Windows and its ability to provide driver support and updates. They noted how Windows has maintained backward compatibility and stable driver interfaces, while Android's fragmented support leads to higher security risks.
4. **User Responsibility and Awareness**: There was an emphasis on the need for consumers to be vigilant about the devices they use and to understand the risks associated with their software ecosystems. Many pointed out that users should take proactive measures to secure their devices.
5. **Long-Term Support Challenges**: The discussion indicated that long-term support for devices, especially in the Android ecosystem, is a challenge. Many commenters expressed frustration with how manufacturers handle end-of-life support for older devices.

Overall, the implications of the malware incident sparked broader conversations about the state of Android security, the responsibilities of manufacturers, and the need for more reliable support systems to protect consumers.
