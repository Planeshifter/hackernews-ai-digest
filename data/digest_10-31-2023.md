#### [Submission URL](https://www.datatilsynet.no/aktuelt/aktuelle-nyheter-2023/datatilsynets-vedtak-mot-meta-utvides-til-eueos-og-gjores-permanent/) | 417 points | by [aleksanb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aleksanb) | [227 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38092612)

Datatilsynet, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, has received support from the European Data Protection Board (EDPB) in its ongoing battle against Meta (formerly known as Facebook) regarding ad-based tracking and profiling on its platforms. The EDPB has decided to make the Norwegian ban on ad-based marketing on Facebook and Instagram permanent and extend it to cover the entire European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA). This decision comes after ongoing concerns about illegal tracking, surveillance, and profiling practices by Meta. The European Data Protection Board's decision serves as an instruction to the Irish Data Protection Commission to impose a permanent ban on Meta's European headquarters in Ireland. The ban will come into effect once this has been done. With over 250 million active users in the EU/EEA, Meta has repeatedly been called out for violating user privacy, and the EDPB's decision is seen as a firm stance against the company's disregard for the law. Meta has stated its intention to seek user consent for ad-based marketing in the future but has yet to make concrete changes to its practices. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority has expressed doubts about Meta's proposed consent solution, which would require non-consenting users to pay a fee. The EDPB's decision is crucial in ensuring that Meta's illegal activities are halted while the company searches for a lawful way forward.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of data privacy, Facebook's advertising practices, and the role of regulations in protecting user rights. Some users argue that Facebook and other companies track and share user data for advertising purposes, and that this violates user privacy. They also question the effectiveness of consent-based solutions proposed by Facebook. Others point out that newspapers and other media outlets engage in similar advertising behavior. One user highlights the double standards in criticizing Facebook while simultaneously participating in similar practices. There is also a discussion about the role of regulations and whether they are capable of addressing the privacy concerns raised by Facebook. Some argue that regulations are necessary to protect user rights, while others express skepticism about their effectiveness. Some users bring up alternative messaging platforms like Signal and WhatsApp, which prioritize privacy compliance.

The conversation extends to discussing job search and LinkedIn, as well as the trade-offs between privacy and the convenience offered by social media platforms. Users also debate the rights users have in exchanging their personal data for services. There is disagreement on the topic of regulation, with some arguing that it is necessary to regulate Facebook's policies and protect user privacy, while others question the validity of regulations and argue that they impede free speech and infringe on personal freedoms. Some users challenge the notion that Facebook should provide its services for free, arguing that many companies charge for services and data usage. The discussion also touches on the issue of data collection by companies and the ethical implications of monetizing personal data.

In conclusion, the discussion explores various perspectives on data privacy, the role of regulations, the practices of companies like Facebook, and the trade-offs inherent in the digital landscape.

2. Another user highlights the potential of Copilot to generate code but mentions that it falls short when it comes to explaining complex functions or answering nuanced questions.
3. One commenter acknowledges the revenue potential of GitHub Copilot, estimating it could bring in $10 million in monthly recurring revenue. They praise Microsoft's achievement in building such a product.
4. There is a discussion about the cost and scalability of GitHub Copilot. One user suggests that unless 100 people are watching others type and quickly writing their own suggestions, the non-trivial maintenance and development costs of Copilot may not be sustainable.
5. A user cites a report claiming GitHub Copilot has heavy limitations, suggesting that $120 million in revenue might be untenable due to costs related to competitive salaries and GPU hardware.
6. A commenter brings up the issue of Microsoft's credibility, suggesting that the company has a history of misleading with its sales numbers, particularly in competitive markets.
7. This prompts a discussion about the ethics of a publicly traded company falsifying numbers, with one user implying that it may not be surprising for a company to engage in such behavior.

Overall, the comments touch on concerns about the performance and limitations of GitHub Copilot, its revenue potential, the cost scalability of the service, and skepticism regarding Microsoft's credibility in sales reporting.

### AI can diagnose type 2 diabetes in 10 seconds from your voice

#### [Submission URL](https://www.diabetes.co.uk/news/2023/oct/say-what-ai-can-diagnose-type-2-diabetes-in-10-seconds-from-your-voice.html) | 31 points | by [daoboy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=daoboy) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38083857)

Researchers have trained an artificial intelligence (AI) model to diagnose type 2 diabetes by analyzing the voice of patients. The Canadian medical researchers used machine learning to identify 14 vocal differences between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes, including changes in pitch and intensity. The AI model, when combined with basic health data, could potentially provide remote and automatic diagnoses, lowering the cost and barriers to diabetes screening. The research team hopes that this AI technology will transform how diabetes is detected and enable more widespread screening for the condition.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the effectiveness and validity of using voice analysis to diagnose type 2 diabetes. Some users express skepticism, stating that factors like insulin resistance and vocal patterns related to being overweight are probably more indicative of diabetes than simple voice changes. They also suggest that people may not be honest when self-reporting their health conditions. 

Others provide more information about the study, stating that researchers from Klick Applied Sciences in Canada trained an AI model using 267 voice recordings of individuals living in India. The recordings were from 79 women and 113 men, with 72 participants being undiagnosed and 57 diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Analysis of the recordings identified 14 vocal differences between the two groups. 

There is also a discussion about the accuracy of the AI model, with some users questioning the sensitivity and specificity of the model. They note that the published results did not provide detailed information on this. One user suggests that the results show a 75% accuracy rate, while others argue that this means there is still a 25% chance of misdiagnosis.

Some users express doubts about the study, pointing out its small sample size and the need for further research and replication. They also mention that voice analysis may only provide limited insights into metabolism and hearing ability related to diabetes.

In response to one user's comment about the study using BMI as a predictive model, another user clarifies that the AI model actually uses logistic regression and Naive Bayes methods rather than more advanced AI techniques. They also note that the study does not provide detailed information on the specific voice features used for analysis.

One user concludes that the study seems questionable and may not be reliable, while another states that they are a person with type 2 diabetes themselves.

### Tesla wins first US Autopilot trial involving fatal crash

#### [Submission URL](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-wins-autopilot-trial-involving-fatal-crash-2023-10-31/) | 17 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38089967)

Tesla has won its first trial in the United States over allegations that its Autopilot driver-assistant feature caused a fatal accident. The case involved a 2019 crash that resulted in the death of the vehicle's owner and serious injuries to two passengers. The lawsuit claimed that the Autopilot system caused the car to veer off the road and collide with a palm tree. However, Tesla successfully argued that the driver was at fault, as they had consumed alcohol before getting behind the wheel. This victory comes as Tesla faces multiple lawsuits and investigations related to its Autopilot technology. It also highlights the company's argument that the ultimate responsibility for incidents on the road lies with the human driver rather than the software.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the fairness of the trial decision and the responsibility of both Tesla and the driver in the fatal accident case. One user argues that if Tesla's marketing claims that Autopilot is self-driving, then it should also bear responsibility for accidents. Another user highlights an article that discusses the validity of the driver's blood alcohol content (BAC) and how a sudden swerving of a vehicle on the road can be a reason for collisions, even without the driver being completely intoxicated. There are also comments debating the need for verifying BAC levels and questioning the credibility of Tesla's software when it comes to ensuring driver safety. Another user raises concerns about Tesla's reliance on the human driver to handle emergencies and suggests that regulations should require more testing of autonomous systems in critical situations. In summary, the discussion covers various viewpoints on the trial, Tesla's marketing, the responsibility of the driver, the reliability of BAC measurements, and the importance of human supervision in autonomous driving technology.
