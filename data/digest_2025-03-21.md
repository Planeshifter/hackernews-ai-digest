1. **Theory vs. Practice**:  
   - Some argue that theoretical frameworks (e.g., linear algebra, optimization, graphical models) are essential for understanding model architectures, activation functions, and design choices. However, others note that ML’s empirical nature often reduces theory to a supportive role, with unpredictability in training and reliance on heuristics (e.g., random initialization, hyperparameter tuning) dominating practical work.  
   - Skepticism exists about the direct applicability of advanced math (e.g., differential geometry, abstract algebra) in modern ML workflows, especially with large language models where theoretical insights are limited.

2. **Educational Gaps**:  
   - While ML courses cover basics like linear separability and XOR problems, deeper architectural nuances (e.g., differences between 2-layer vs. 32-layer networks, transformer layers) lack clear theoretical explanations. Resources like Andrew Ng’s Coursera course are recommended for beginners, but advanced theory remains niche.  

3. **Role of Randomness**:  
   - Randomness in data shuffling, weight initialization, and dropout is acknowledged as critical yet poorly understood, leading to challenges in debugging and reproducibility.  

4. **High-Dimensional Challenges**:  
   - Visualizing high-dimensional spaces and interpreting model decisions is difficult, with activation functions and architectures (e.g., VGG, transformers) often treated as black boxes. Concepts like the Whitney embedding theorem and manifold learning are mentioned as theoretical tools to bridge gaps.  

5. **Math Requirements**:  
   - Heavy mathematical foundations (e.g., metric theory, topology) are seen as beneficial but daunting for practitioners. Some argue that strong notation and abstract math are underappreciated in applied ML, while others prioritize engineering intuition.  

6. **Community Resources**:  
   - Links to practical guides (e.g., the "Tuning Playbook") and papers on emergent model behaviors are shared, reflecting a desire for accessible yet rigorous resources.  

In summary, the discussion underscores the tension between valuing theoretical depth for principled design and accepting the trial-and-error reality of ML practice. Both perspectives agree on the complexity of the field but diverge on how much theory is "enough" for building effective systems.

#### [Submission URL](https://victorpoughon.github.io/torchlensmaker/) | 171 points | by [fouronnes3](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fouronnes3) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43435438)

Introducing Torch Lens Maker: an innovative open-source Python library designed for differentiable geometric optics, based on PyTorch. Created by Victor, this experimental project seeks to revolutionize the way complex real-world optical systems are designed, such as lenses and mirrors, by leveraging modern computing techniques and cutting-edge numerical optimization.

At the heart of Torch Lens Maker is the concept of differentiable geometric optics, which combines 3D collision detection with the laws of optics, all implemented in PyTorch. This framework allows optical elements to be treated similarly to layers in a neural network. Instead of images, text, or audio, the data flowing through this system are rays of light, shaped and directed by the optical elements' parameters such as surface shape and refractive material.

The magic lies in using PyTorch’s existing tools like `torch.nn` and `nn.Module`, stacking lenses and mirrors much like you would with Conv2d and ReLU layers in a neural network. This allows the application of PyTorch's powerful automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms to refine optical designs, akin to training a neural network for minimal prediction error.

Victor envisions this project as an exploration of code-driven design for optical systems, much like existing tools do for mechanical designs. However, Torch Lens Maker is still in its infancy and highly experimental, with a long roadmap ahead. The API is subject to change, and a stable release is not yet on the horizon. Victor is actively seeking funding and support to dedicate full time to this venture, inviting donations, sponsorships, or even direct hiring to push the project further.

Torch Lens Maker promises to harness the massive power of modern open-source machine learning tooling, offering features like automatic differentiation, GPU support, and distributed training, all to redefine optical system design. If you're intrigued by the convergence of machine learning and optics, consider supporting Victor’s ambitious project.
