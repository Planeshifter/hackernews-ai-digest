### Show HN: WhatsApp-Llama: A clone of yourself from your WhatsApp conversations

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Ads-cmu/WhatsApp-Llama) | 115 points | by [advaith08](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=advaith08) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37448005)

Introducing WhatsApp-Llama: Fine-tune Llama 7b to Mimic Your WhatsApp Style

Have you ever wanted an AI that speaks just like you? Well, now you can! A team from Carnegie Mellon University has forked the popular Llama-recipes repository and created WhatsApp-Llama, a tool that allows you to train a language model to replicate your personal texting style on WhatsApp.

By inputting your WhatsApp conversations, you can fine-tune the Llama-2 7b chat model to respond just like you do. The team used parameter efficient finetuning (QLoRA) and int4 quantization on a single GPU to achieve impressive results.

In their experiments, the fine-tuned Llama-2 model quickly picked up on the nuances of the user's texting style. The average number of words generated by the finetuned Llama-2 was 300% more than the vanilla Llama-2 model. The model accurately replicated common phrases and emoji usage.

To test the model's performance, the team conducted a Turing Test with friends. They asked their friends to ask three questions on WhatsApp and then responded with two candidate responses, one from themselves and one from the Llama-2 model. The friends had to guess which response was from the user and which one was from the AI. The model fooled 10% of the friends, with some of its responses being eerily similar to the user's own.

To get started with WhatsApp-Llama, you need to export your WhatsApp chats and preprocess the dataset. The detailed steps can be found in the README file of the repository. The team recommends exporting 10 WhatsApp chats from friends you frequently speak to, excluding media.

With WhatsApp-Llama, you can have an AI that speaks just like you on WhatsApp. This opens up possibilities for personalization and automation in text-based communication. So go ahead, unleash your AI clone and start chatting!

The discussion around the submission "Introducing WhatsApp-Llama: Fine-tune Llama 7b to Mimic Your WhatsApp Style" on Hacker News covered various topics. Here is a summary of the key points:

- One user mentioned that they haven't watched Silicon Valley, prompting another user to share a link to a funny clip from the show.
- There was a reference to the Black Mirror episode "Be Right Back," which reminded another user of the episode.
- Discussions shifted to the technical aspects of using Llama models. One user mentioned that using a 13B model instead of a 7B model significantly improved results. However, others pointed out that the cost of using larger models, such as the 3090 GPU, could be high.
- Users expressed their experiences with the Llama models and the level of accuracy in mimicking their texting style.
- Some users shared their interest in replicating other famous fictional characters, such as Harry Potter portraits.
