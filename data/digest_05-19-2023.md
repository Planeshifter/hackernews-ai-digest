A new library called webgpu-torch has been developed by a web developer that implements PyTorch in TypeScript using the new WebGPU standard. PyTorch provides an optimized math library, an automatic differentiation library, and a neural network library that can all be used to develop AI models. Using the WebGPU standard gives access to the graphics processing unit and allows the running of AI models at a faster speed than before. The library is available on NPM and can be used in both browsers and Node.js.

The comments cover discussions on various topics such as the benefits of using a typed language like TypeScript, python's drawbacks in handling multi-dimensional arrays, the advantage of using a typed approach and the ability to check dimensions in TypeScript, discussions around object handling, and the progress of Python's type system. There is also discussion on how this library compares to webgpu in TensorFlow and the problems faced with the TypeScript syntax. Additionally, there is a discussion on intuitive language that could be used for Machine Learning and typescript's role in the same. Finally, one comment highlights that there was an issue with testing the library in a specific browser version.

### Google Photorealistic 3D Tiles and Unreal Engine

#### [Submission URL](https://nilsbakker.nl/portfolio/3d-tiles/) | 601 points | by [stijnbakker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stijnbakker) | [114 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36000631)

A developer recently created an immersive experience using Unreal Engine 5.1, Google Maps 3D tiles API, and ChatGPT API. The goal was to create an interactive experience where users enter prompts in a specific format to receive dynamic responses, which are displayed in 3D text in a virtual world. The Google Maps API was used to translate XY coordinates obtained from the prompt to retrieve location data, which was used to fetch 3D geometry for the designated location. The Niagara particle system was used to create a portal mechanism to cleverly hide the transition process between locations. Additionally, the player's height above ground level was checked during teleportation to enhance the user experience. Although this current implementation generates random values for time, actual time and weather data can be retrieved from another API in the future.

The submission generated discussion on how Google Maps API could be improved in the future by producing high-resolution geometry for all objects and textures to enhance the user experience. Some users shared their past experiences with driving games that used Google Maps data, while others discussed other VR games and projects that used 3D modeling. A YouTube video and screenshot were shared, as well as tutorials and resources for using Google Maps API. There was confusion when a user encountered an error message saying "Resource Limit Reached: Insufficient Storage." Another user shared a similar web-based project using DeckGL, shadow lighting, and post-processing effects. The thread also mentioned the limitations of the number of 3D tile rendering requests per day.

### Drag Your GAN: Interactive Point-Based Manipulation of Images

#### [Submission URL](https://vcai.mpi-inf.mpg.de/projects/DragGAN/) | 140 points | by [waqasy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=waqasy) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35998649)

Researchers have developed an interactive point-based manipulation tool called DragGAN, which allows for flexible and precise control of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Using DragGAN, users can manipulate the pose, shape, expression and layout of various categories of images, including animals, cars and landscapes by "dragging" any points of the image to reach target positions. The tool consists of feature-based motion supervision that guides the handle point to the target position and a point tracking system that uses discriminative GAN features to track the handle point's position. The system produces realistic outputs and outperformed existing approaches in image manipulation and point tracking tasks.

The discussion covers a wide range of topics, including the technical aspects of the tool, its potential impact on the industry, and the ethical implications of the use of AI-generated images. Some comments express concerns about the misuse of such tools in creating fake or misleading images, while others highlight the potential benefits in fields such as fashion and cinema. The discussion also touches on related topics such as cryptography, surveillance, and journalism.

### Product quantization for vector search

#### [Submission URL](https://zilliz.com/blog/scalar-quantization-and-product-quantization) | 50 points | by [fzliu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fzliu) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36004401)

In this tutorial from BackVector Database, the author discusses two indexing algorithms - flat indexing and inverted file - and constructs their own scalar and product quantization algorithms in Python. They explain that quantization reduces the precision of the vectors in order to reduce the size of the database, making vector searches faster and more memory efficient. By implementing these techniques, the author creates an 8x reduction in the size of their test dataset. A helpful step-by-step guide for anyone interested in improving their vector search strategies.

The comments discuss different ways of improving vector search strategies and techniques such as PQ vector compression and indexing. One commenter recommends the use of PQ, an approximation k-NN search algorithm, while another suggests using HSNW and IVF PQ as a hybrid solution for targeted search toward model structure and instance encoding. Another commenter recommends using a product quantization indexer plugin for PostgreSQL, while others discuss the impact of complex clustering on performance and ways to address it. Overall, it is suggested that PQ is a good baseline for vector searches, and the use of hybrid techniques, instance encoding, and compression can significantly improve performance.

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has designed an AI inference accelerator called MTIA v1. This first-generation ASIC was designed specifically for recommendation models, which are used across Meta's services and applications. To improve efficiency at scale, Meta found that GPUs were not always the best solution. The MTIA v1 is fabricated in TSMC 7nm process and runs at 800 MHz, providing 102.4 TOPS at INT8 precision and 51.2 TFLOPS at FP16 precision. It consists of a grid of processing elements (PEs) and interconnects, as well as memory resources. The MTIA software stack integrates with PyTorch, providing a familiar developer experience.

The discussion in the comments compares the MTIA v1 with Google Cloud TPU v4, highlights the differences between training-specific chips and inference-specific chips, and covers the challenges with scaling recommendation workloads. Some users also argue about the advantages of custom ASIC designs versus generic GPUs. There is also discussion about whether Meta would stop selling cloud computing services, but this is dismissed as a rumor.

### GPT trainer says he's traumatized from the RLHF work

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bigtechnology.com/p/he-helped-train-chatgpt-it-traumatized) | 46 points | by [kantrowitz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kantrowitz) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36002890)

Workers in Nairobi, Kenya, who trained OpenAI’s GPT models, were left traumatized after spending nine hours a day, five days a week, labeling explicit content, including child sexual abuse material, for the model. Richard Mathenge, who led the team, said the texts were “unimaginable,” and one passage even described a father having sex with an animal in front of his child. Workers were paid approximately $1 per hour, or less, causing some to work towards establishing an African Content Moderators Union. OpenAI said it takes the mental health of its employees and contractors very seriously and believed Sama was offering “wellness programs and 1:1 counseling” until its workers reported otherwise.

The discussion covers the challenges of content moderation and the impact on human moderators, with some commenters suggesting that AI should replace humans for content moderation. Others highlight the importance of investing in mental health services for content moderators and advocating for workers' rights and fair compensation. The discussion also touches on the challenges faced by African nations in poverty and corruption and the impact of AI on society.
