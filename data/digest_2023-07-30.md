### Why transformative artificial intelligence is hard to achieve

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) | 79 points | by [hunglee2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hunglee2) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36934032)

Transformative artificial intelligence (AI) has been talked about as the next major technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the world. But according to a recent essay, achieving this level of AI is actually extremely difficult. The article highlights several challenges that stand in the way of transformative AI.

One of the main challenges is the complexity of AI itself. AI systems would need to be as good as or better than humans at all economically valuable tasks in order to be truly transformative. However, measuring AI's performance on predetermined tasks is risky, as there may be tasks we're not even aware of that are necessary for real-world impact. The essay defines transformative AI in terms of its observed economic impact, specifically looking at productivity growth.

Another challenge is the potential imbalance in productivity growth. Even if AI progresses rapidly in certain areas, there may still be major technical hurdles to overcome in other areas. And even if AI can automate many tasks, it may not be able to automate all tasks, leaving certain sectors relatively more valuable and limiting the overall impact on the economy. This has been observed in the past, where productivity growth has been uneven across sectors, leading to slower overall growth.

Furthermore, the production of ideas itself has bottlenecks that are difficult to overcome. Automating certain tasks may have different effects on growth compared to automating all tasks. Some steps in the innovation process may be essential but hard to improve, leading to constraints on explosive growth.

Overall, the essay suggests that while AI has the potential to be transformative, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed. It's important to temper expectations and recognize the complexities and limitations of achieving transformative AI.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to transformative AI. Some users question whether AI can truly make significant contributions to society, particularly in the realm of mathematics, while others argue that AI has the potential to generate novel mathematical proofs. There is also a discussion about the limitations of current AI models, such as their lack of true understanding and the need for more diverse training data. The topic of intelligence and the definition of intelligence in AI systems is also touched upon. Additionally, there is a debate about whether AI can surpass human capabilities, with some suggesting that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for humans.

Welcome to Wikifunctions, a free library of functions that anyone can soon edit! This Wikimedia project aims to collaboratively create and maintain a library of code functions to support the Wikimedia projects and beyond, in both natural and programming languages. A function is a sequence of programming instructions that performs calculations based on data provided. Functions can answer questions like calculating the number of days between two dates or finding the distance between two cities.

Currently in locked-down testing, this wiki will soon allow editing. You can suggest a function or apply for edit rights. Browse the list of functions or objects by type to explore the existing content. If you're new to Wikifunctions, you can learn more about it through the introduction, FAQ, and glossary sections. Additionally, you can contribute to other areas such as translation.

Get involved in the project by joining as a translator or seeking help through the Project chat or Telegram/IRC channel. If you encounter any technical issues, report them so they can be addressed.

In recent news, Wikifunctions is now up in a read-only mode, marking progress towards its full functionality. Planning deployment dates have been discussed, and multilingual editing has been introduced. The new viewing and editing experience is also available, offering improved features. Check out the reflection by Maria Keet on selecting the right implementation, as well as updates on Abstract Wikipedia in Swedish and the initiative of decolonizing functions.

Wikifunctions is part of the nonprofit, multilingual, and free-content Wikimedia family.

### Greg Rutkowski was removed from Stable Diffusion; AI artists brought him back

#### [Submission URL](https://decrypt.co/150575/greg-rutkowski-removed-from-stable-diffusion-but-brought-back-by-ai-artists) | 57 points | by [ecliptik](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ecliptik) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36934350)

Digital artist Greg Rutkowski has found himself at the center of the AI art scene, despite wanting nothing to do with it. Rutkowski's vibrant and surreal style has become highly sought-after by AI art creators looking to mimic his unique artistic style using AI algorithms. His name has become one of the most popular keywords used by AI artists generating art with algorithms like Stable Diffusion. However, despite opposing the AI art trend, Rutkowski's work was included in the dataset of Stable Diffusion. To address this, AI artists have now created a tool to mimic Rutkowski's style against his wishes. As Stable Diffusion is an open-source AI image generator, Rutkowski and the creators of Stable Diffusion have no control over its usage. This situation has led Rutkowski to grapple with distinguishing between his genuine works and AI-generated pieces. The evolving relationship between artists and AI technology in the art world continues to raise questions of innovation, infringement, and the blurry line between the two.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the controversy surrounding Greg Rutkowski's art being used as a reference in AI-generated art without his consent. One commenter argues that styles don't belong to artists and removing artist names from training data is necessary to describe styles accurately. They also mention that AI can make it easier for artists to mimic styles of others. Another commenter brings up the issue of intellectual property law and how it has not kept up with technology, leading to a lack of protection for artists. Many commenters discuss the different styles present in Stable Diffusion and how AI-generated art can be indistinguishable from human-created art. There is also a debate about the role of AI in art and whether it diminishes the value of human creativity. Some argue that talented artists using AI can create stunning work, while others argue that AI hampers human creativity. The discussion also touches on the potential job displacement of artists by AI technology and the importance of artists not relying solely on the internet for exposure.
