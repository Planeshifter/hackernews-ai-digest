Researchers from Brigham Young University (BYU) and Duke University have developed an AI system that can improve online conversations about polarizing topics by suggesting more polite ways to express opinions. The researchers conducted a field experiment with 1,574 participants who engaged in online discussions about gun regulation in the US. One participant in each conversation received three AI-generated suggestions for rephrasing their message before sending it. The AI suggestions focused on making statements more polite without altering their content. Overall, participants accepted the AI-suggested rephrasings two-thirds of the time. The partners of individuals who implemented the AI suggestions reported significantly higher conversation quality and were more willing to listen to opposing perspectives. The researchers believe that this AI system could combat the toxic online culture and create a more positive digital landscape.

The discussion on Hacker News about the AI system designed to improve online conversations was varied. Some users expressed concerns about the implications of platforms maximizing engagement and targeting sensitive topics for profit. They pointed out examples of platforms like Twitter and Reddit implementing strategies that prioritize maximizing outrage and driving engagement, sometimes leading to negative consequences. Others disagreed, arguing that platforms like Reddit have taken action against hateful subreddits and that the focus should be on addressing specific arguments rather than trying to manipulate discourse. There was also a discussion about whether maximizing engagement or promoting civility should be the goal of platforms. Some users mentioned the challenges of content moderation and the difficulty in balancing free speech and preventing harmful behavior. The conversation also touched on the role of platforms in addressing problematic content and the potential backlash from different user groups. A few users discussed the potential impact of the AI system, with one user comparing it to the Gift Shop Sketch from Monty Python, suggesting that it may lead to conversations becoming overly polite and losing meaning. Others expressed concerns about AI-driven censorship and the potential for centralized control. Overall, the discussion reflected a range of perspectives and concerns about online discourse, platform strategies, and the implications of AI systems on conversation quality and digital culture.

### Unbundling AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ben-evans.com/benedictevans/2023/10/5/unbundling-ai) | 22 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37797866)

Benedict Evans discusses the potential of OpenAI's ChatGPT 3.5 and the challenges it brings. While the technology promises to answer any question, it also raises two problems: a science problem and a product problem. The science problem lies in the fact that the model provides probabilistic answers, meaning it offers probable answers rather than definitive ones. This poses challenges in determining the accuracy of the responses. The product problem revolves around presenting and packaging uncertainty. While ChatGPT can generate responses, users have to validate and verify the information, making it more like an intern that can provide drafts. Additionally, there is a question of how to present uncertainty in search results, as traditional search engines, like Google, offer suggestions but do not provide definitive answers. Overall, while ChatGPT offers exciting possibilities, there are still hurdles to overcome.

The comments on the submission revolve around different perspectives on the limitations and potential of OpenAI's ChatGPT. Here are some key points made by the commenters:
- One commenter acknowledges the current limitations of language models, highlighting the challenges with management, habituation, and seeing them as more like tools. They mention that GPT-4 and similar models will likely transform society and decision-making processes.
- Another commenter appreciates the balanced approach of the article, noting that it compresses a lot of discussions and presents counterpoints effectively. They mention that starting an interface for chat sessions with prompts and pictures can help filter results and personalize responses based on specific skills and job titles.
- A commenter points out that there are low verifiable claims in the article and expresses skepticism. They mention that the article seems to be more about marketing and promoting language models without providing detailed instructions or corrections for individual tasks.
- One commenter shares their experience using ChatGPT, comparing it to other models like Anthropic and Hugging Face. They mention how language models have hallucination problems and that feedback extends the CoPilot problem.

Overall, the comments reflect a range of perspectives on the current capabilities and potential issues surrounding language models like ChatGPT.

### Amazon launches its Bedrock generative AI service in general availability

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/28/amazon-launches-its-bedrock-generative-ai-service-in-general-availability/) | 50 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37806323)

Amazon has announced the general availability of Bedrock, its service that offers a choice of generative AI models from Amazon itself and third-party partners through an API. Bedrock allows AWS customers to build apps on top of generative AI models and customize them with their proprietary data. Brands and developers can also create AI "agents" that automatically execute tasks like booking travel or processing insurance claims. In the coming weeks, Llama 2, the open source large language model from Meta, will be available on Bedrock. Amazon claims that Bedrock will be the first "fully managed generative AI service" to offer Llama 2. The service is comparable to Google's Vertex AI but has an advantage in that it integrates well with existing AWS services. Amazon also announced the rollout of its Titan Embeddings model, a first-party model that converts text to numerical representations for search and personalization applications. With these announcements and its recent investment in AI startup Anthropic, Amazon is aiming to make waves in the generative AI market.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of Amazon's Bedrock service and generative AI in general.

- One user comments that Amazon is trying to catch up with Microsoft and Google in the integrated AI products space, but they question if this is just another checklist item for cloud providers and if Amazon's approach is truly innovative.
- Another user compares the current state of generative AI to infancy and suggests that more time and effort are needed to produce reliable and capable solutions.
- A different user acknowledges that while AWS has many innovative products, they often lack hand-holding managed services.
- One user points out that the Bedrock service makes sense as an API offering because Amazon primarily sells services, whereas another user shares pricing information for the service.
- There is also mention of users eagerly waiting for Bedrock to include the Llama 2 model from Anthropic, and someone else noting that they have been waiting for access to Claude 2 directly from Anthropic.
- An issue is raised regarding access to the nthrpccld-v2 model in some regions, with customers experiencing AccessDeniedExceptions when trying to use the InvokeModel API.

Overall, the discussion touches on the competitors in the generative AI space, the pricing of Bedrock, and the issues users face when trying to access certain models.
