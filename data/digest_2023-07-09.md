New York City is set to enforce a groundbreaking law aimed at tackling bias in AI hiring tools. The law, first passed in 2021, requires employers to be transparent about their use of AI and algorithmic-based tools in the hiring process. Companies must inform candidates of their use of such tools and disclose what personal data is being collected. Additionally, the law mandates that companies undergo annual audits to identify potential bias within their AI systems. While the law is a step towards transparency, critics argue that it may not go far enough in protecting job candidates from bias. They argue that developers can find loopholes to pass or bypass audits, rendering them less effective in detecting bias. Nonetheless, the enforcement of this law is a significant move towards promoting fairness and accountability in the AI hiring process.

Introducing Rio Terminal: a powerful native and web terminal application that is powered by Rust, WebGPU, and WebAssembly. Rio is known for its speed, thanks to its built-in Rust language and the use of the Alacritty terminal's VTE for ANSI handling and parsing. The terminal also features a minimal tabs design and supports multi-window features on various platforms including Windows, MacOS, and Linux. What sets Rio apart is its ability to run in browsers and desktop environments, making it ideal for creating plugins for cross-platform architectures. The WebAssembly version of Rio is still in progress but promises to bring the same functionality to the web. With its impressive rendering capabilities through its Sugarloaf renderer, Rio is a versatile tool for developers and users alike.
