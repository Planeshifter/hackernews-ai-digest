#### [Submission URL](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2024/05/18/seven-dyson-sphere-candidates/) | 173 points | by [sohkamyung](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sohkamyung) | [298 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40397823)

The latest buzz on Hacker News is all about Dyson sphere candidates! Astronomers are abuzz with excitement over seven potential candidates for Dyson spheres, megastructures that could one day enclose stars to harness their energy. The discussion revolves around Project Hephaistos' latest paper in 2024, where researchers analyze infrared signatures of these candidates, hinting at possible extraterrestrial civilizations advanced enough to build such structures.

The paper delves into the complexities of photometry in detecting Dyson spheres, as it involves measuring light across different wavelengths to infer properties like distance, temperature, and composition. Modeling the effects of a Dyson sphere on a star's photometry requires accounting for both obscuration of the star and re-emission of absorbed radiation at longer wavelengths due to the megastructure's heat.

The team behind Project Hephaistos leveraged data from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE to identify stars potentially hosting Dyson spheres, focusing on partial spheres that partially obscure the star's light. By scrutinizing mid-infrared signatures for excess heat, they sifted through millions of models to pinpoint seven candidates that seem to be genuine infrared sources free of contamination.

While the researchers are cautious to label these sources as Dyson spheres, the tantalizing possibility of alien megastructures lurking among the stars sparks curiosity and contemplation within the scientific community. Stay tuned as astronomers continue to unravel the mysteries of these enigmatic candidates and push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos.
