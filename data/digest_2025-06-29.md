On the Hacker News front today, there's an intriguing piece diving deep into the battle between virtual machines (VMs) and malware's cunning tactics. It turns out, some sneaky malware strains have a clever trick up their sleeves – they perform checks to see if they’re running inside a VM, and one surprising method is to seek out the CPU fan presence. In VMs, hardware emulation may miss certain components, like the CPU fan, which is where malware cleverly sniffs out its host to dodge analysis by security researchers. 

The article humorously explores an experimental approach to trick malware by mimicking hardware presence, specifically the CPU fan, using SMBIOS (System Management BIOS) data and WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) classes like Win32_Fan. While initially plagued with challenges, including the realization that certain SMBIOS structures can't be readily overridden in Xen (a popular VMM), the writer embarks on a quest to find a workaround. He patches the Xen source code to allow for emulating a CPU fan and attempts to include correlating components like the temperature probe (SMBIOS type 28), since the fan’s functionality might be linked to it.

Ultimately, this fascinating tale showcases not just the lengths security enthusiasts will go to coax malware out into the open but also the ongoing interplay of hide-and-seek between malicious software and cybersecurity experts. It's a reminder of the ever-evolving cat-and-mouse game in digital security realms.

#### [Submission URL](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/blackwell-nvidias-massive-gpu) | 108 points | by [pella](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pella) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44409391)

Nvidia has once again proven its prowess in the realm of massive GPUs with the unveiling of Blackwell, its latest graphics architecture. Standing out for its sheer size and power, the GB202 die within Blackwell is a giant at 750mm², loaded with an impressive 92.2 billion transistors. Designed to be a computing powerhouse, it incorporates 192 Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), which are the closest GPU equivalent to CPU cores, paired with a high-capacity memory subsystem to handle demanding workloads.

The RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell, boasting the most expansive GB202 configuration yet, leads Nvidia’s product range alongside the RTX 5090, each tapping into the might of the GB202 with slight differences in SM deployment. In direct comparison, AMD’s RDNA4 flagship, the RX 9070, lags slightly behind—revealing the scale of Blackwell's supremacy in graphics processing architecture.

Nvidia’s architecture leverages a unique work distribution system, where a 1:16 Graphics Processing Cluster (GPC) to SM ratio allows for increased computation efficiency by adjusting SM counts without adding copies of GPC-level hardware. This design strategy, however, can lead to bottlenecks during short-duration tasks as the GPC’s capacity to allocate work may become a limiting factor.

Blackwell features significant improvements over its ancestors, including the ability to switch seamlessly between graphics and compute tasks without halting operations—a notable change from previous generations. The updated SM frontend employs a two-level instruction cache system to manage the demands for high bandwidth associated with Nvidia’s distinct 16-byte instruction format, enhancing performance with a 128 KB L1 instruction cache for reduced bottlenecks.

In comparison, AMD's RDNA4 architecture offers an alternative with variable-length instructions and a simpler caching mechanism, but, Nvidia’s advances allow Blackwell to process mixed workloads more efficiently and tap into higher throughput potential.

Thanks to these advancements, Blackwell emerges as a formidable force in the world of GPUs, pushing the boundaries of what is achievable with massive parallel processing. Special acknowledgment goes to Will Killian for providing access to the RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell system, aiding in the exploration of this technological marvel.

### Universal pre-training by iterated random computation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20057) | 35 points | by [liamdgray](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=liamdgray) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44409555)

In an intriguing study titled "Universal pre-training by iterated random computation," Peter Bloem explores a novel approach to pre-training machine learning models using randomly generated data. This new method is grounded in theoretical insights from algorithmic complexity and ties into recent advances showing that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. Bloem presents fresh theoretical results and provides empirical evidence supporting the use of synthetic data for pre-training, which shows promise even before exposure to real data.

The study confirms previous findings that this technique enables models to perform zero-shot in-context learning on various datasets, and this capability scales with model size. Importantly, the research extends these results to apply to real-world data scenarios, demonstrating that fine-tuning models post-pre-training leads to faster learning and improved generalization.

This paper, presented on arXiv and accessible in PDF format, adds a significant dimension to current machine learning practices, suggesting that embracing randomness in pre-training can enhance model performance efficiently. For more detailed insights, you can access the full paper via its arXiv page.
