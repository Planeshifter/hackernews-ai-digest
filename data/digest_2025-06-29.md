### Universal pre-training by iterated random computation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20057) | 35 points | by [liamdgray](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=liamdgray) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44409555)

In an intriguing study titled "Universal pre-training by iterated random computation," Peter Bloem explores a novel approach to pre-training machine learning models using randomly generated data. This new method is grounded in theoretical insights from algorithmic complexity and ties into recent advances showing that sequence models can be trained to approximate Solomonoff induction. Bloem presents fresh theoretical results and provides empirical evidence supporting the use of synthetic data for pre-training, which shows promise even before exposure to real data.

The study confirms previous findings that this technique enables models to perform zero-shot in-context learning on various datasets, and this capability scales with model size. Importantly, the research extends these results to apply to real-world data scenarios, demonstrating that fine-tuning models post-pre-training leads to faster learning and improved generalization.

This paper, presented on arXiv and accessible in PDF format, adds a significant dimension to current machine learning practices, suggesting that embracing randomness in pre-training can enhance model performance efficiently. For more detailed insights, you can access the full paper via its arXiv page.
