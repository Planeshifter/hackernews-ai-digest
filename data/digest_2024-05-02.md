#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/SuperpoweredAI/spRAG) | 63 points | by [zmccormick7](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zmccormick7) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40237546)

The latest project making waves on Hacker News is spRAG, a high-performance RAG framework designed for handling complex queries over unstructured data, such as financial reports and legal documents. By utilizing innovative techniques like AutoContext and Relevant Segment Extraction (RSE), spRAG achieves significantly higher accuracy rates compared to traditional RAG baselines. In fact, on the FinanceBench benchmark, spRAG provides correct answers 83% of the time, a vast improvement over the 19% success rate of vanilla RAG systems.
AutoContext injects document-level context into text chunks prior to embedding, enhancing retrieval quality and reducing irrelevant search results. On the other hand, RSE intelligently combines relevant chunks into longer segments, providing better context for answering complex questions. To get started with spRAG, users can easily install it via pip and create KnowledgeBase objects for querying unstructured data. The project's customization options allow users to tailor the framework to their specific needs, making it a versatile tool for various applications.

### Microsoft bans U.S. police from using enterprise AI tool for facial recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/microsoft-bans-u-s-police-departments-from-using-enterprise-ai-tool/) | 245 points | by [coloneltcb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=coloneltcb) | [141 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40240037)

Microsoft's Azure OpenAI Service has taken a firm stance against U.S. police departments utilizing generative AI for facial recognition. The updated terms of service explicitly prohibit such integrations, emphasizing the ban on real-time facial recognition technology from mobile cameras in uncontrolled environments. The move follows concerns raised by critics regarding potential biases and pitfalls in using AI models for law enforcement purposes. This development coincides with Axon's release of a product leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 model, raising questions about the relationship between the two companies and the motivation behind the policy update. While the ban is limited to U.S. police departments, it aligns with Microsoft's and OpenAI's cautious approach towards AI applications in law enforcement and defense sectors. The broader implications of this decision on the future of AI deployment in sensitive domains remain to be seen.

The discussion on the submission delves into various aspects related to surveillance, privacy, and law enforcement. Users highlighted concerns about the Domain Awareness System developed by Microsoft being used by the NYPD, drawing parallels with surveillance measures in China. The effectiveness of cameras for surveillance in cities like London and Singapore sparked debates on privacy and crime prevention. The conversation transitioned to comparisons between different countries' approaches to crime, surveillance, and drug policies, with a focus on Singapore's strict laws. Discussions around the definition of drugs, their regulation, and societal impacts were also prominent. Users touched on the history of certain countries and how their past influences current policies and perceptions. The conversation emphasized the need for independent verification of crime statistics to ensure transparency and accuracy in reporting.

### AI-native startup ain't the same as a typical SaaS company

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/05/02/your-ai-native-startup-aint-the-same-as-a-typical-saas-company/) | 16 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40240468)

At the recent TechCrunch Early Stage event in Boston, Rudina Seseri from Glasswing Ventures discussed the unique challenges that AI startups face compared to traditional SaaS companies. She emphasized the importance of having algorithms and data at the core of an AI company, rather than just integrating AI APIs superficially.

Seseri highlighted the differences in how customers and investors evaluate AI startups versus SaaS startups. Unlike SaaS products that can be rolled out in beta form, AI products require a mature model that customers can trust. This complexity in training algorithms and gaining customer trust makes it harder to find early adopters.

To succeed in the AI space, Seseri advised startups to focus on solving a specific problem with measurable outcomes for the buyer. She suggested emphasizing the business value of AI solutions and staking a defensible position in the market. While big players control the infrastructure and foundation layers of AI, there are opportunities for startups in the application and middle layers.

Seseri recommended investing in the application layer of AI and prioritizing access to unique data and algorithms. She recognized the challenges of building an AI startup but believes that understanding these challenges and building strategically can lead to success in this promising field. In conclusion, while AI startups face steep hurdles, they hold the key to the future of software growth.

The comments on Hacker News primarily discuss the key points made by Rudina Seseri at the TechCrunch Early Stage event in Boston regarding the unique challenges that AI startups face compared to traditional SaaS companies. Users diverge on their perspectives with joenot443 emphasizing the importance of not just wrapping AI APIs around a company, but developing AI at the core, while bnnylv provides a counterpoint by suggesting that companies often need to start by using existing tools before innovating. NomDePlum and plddrpr touch on the applications of AI-powered technology in military encryption and the differences in reliability, quality, and functionality. Moving away from the content of the submission, hzyc reflects on the contrasting experiences of Boston VCs compared to those in the Bay Area, suggesting a potential disconnect, and ShamelessC expresses disappointment in investors' seeming lack of self-awareness.

### Real-time AI using scalable non-expert crowdsourcing in colorectal surgery

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01095-8) | 20 points | by [zachwdc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zachwdc) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40237883)

A new study published on nature.com discusses the use of real-time near-infrared artificial intelligence in colorectal surgery, aiming to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes. The research demonstrates a method to gather surgical tissue annotations through crowdsourcing of non-experts, allowing for the training and deployment of an accurate AI model for surgical anatomy recognition. This innovative approach could potentially reduce complications like anastomotic leaks in bowel surgery.

The study utilized a gamified crowdsourcing platform to obtain annotated training data from 95 colorectal procedures, saving significant expert hours that would have been required for annotation. The crowdsourced annotations were used to train a soft tissue segmentation AI model called Bowel.CSS, which accurately segmented bowel and abdominal wall tissues in real-time. The primary endpoints of the study included assessing the expertise level of the crowdsource workers, expert hours saved, accuracy of the crowdsource annotations compared to expert annotations, and the accuracy of the Bowel.CSS model predictions against expert annotations.

This groundbreaking research showcases the potential of utilizing non-expert crowdsourcing to advance surgical artificial intelligence and improve surgical outcomes. The discussion on this submission seems to be quite unusual and not directly related to the content of the study. Comments include mentions of "grph prbblty stry gghx ttl fnctn nmbr ttl wrds rd rmrkbl" by user karma_pharmer, a comparison to Foldit in surgery games by user zchthwf, and a mention of "SphincterIt" by karma_pharmer. User HumanOstrich simply says "Gross," and TraumaLlama adds "dd." Overall, the discussion appears to be more on the playful or random side rather than focusing on the actual content of the study.
