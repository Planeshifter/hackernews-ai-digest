#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03502) | 172 points | by [kmdupree](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kmdupree) | [100 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39946169)

Today's top story on Hacker News discusses a thought-provoking paper titled "AI and the Problem of Knowledge Collapse" by Andrew J. Peterson. The paper delves into the potential consequences of widespread AI adoption on public understanding, arguing that while AI can process vast amounts of data efficiently, it may inadvertently lead to a phenomenon called "knowledge collapse." This collapse could harm innovation and the richness of human understanding and culture by reducing the diversity of knowledge accessed through AI systems.

The paper highlights that while AI models generate output towards the 'center' of the distribution of data they are trained on, humans have the capacity to seek out diverse forms of knowledge strategically. By providing a simple model, the author demonstrates how a community's reliance on discounted AI-generated content can lead to public beliefs that are significantly further from the truth.

The paper raises important questions about the impact of AI on knowledge dissemination and suggests avenues for further research to mitigate potential negative outcomes. It serves as a valuable contribution to the ongoing discourse on the societal implications of artificial intelligence.

### Identifying Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 images from VAE artifacts (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://hforsten.com/identifying-stable-diffusion-xl-10-images-from-vae-artifacts.html) | 65 points | by [rcarmo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rcarmo) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39944452)

Henrik recently blogged about the latest developments in AI-generated images, focusing on the new SDXL-VAE 1.0 release. This updated version of the text-to-image generation model has stirred up some buzz due to visible artifacts in the generated images, particularly around the edges. These artifacts, caused by the VAE neural network responsible for encoding and decoding images, have sparked discussions on the need for clear identification of AI-generated content.

While some speculate that these artifacts could serve as a watermark for detecting AI-generated images, Stability AI, the creators of SDXL, have not officially confirmed this. The model includes an invisible watermark to mark images as AI-generated, but this can be easily removed from the program. The SDXL 1.0 VAE differs from the 0.9 version in its decoder weights, impacting the image quality around the edges.

Performance-wise, the 1.0 VAE exhibits a slightly lower peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the 0.9 VAE, as per Stability AI's report. These differences are noticeable, with the 1.0 VAE artifacts being distinct and identifiable upon closer inspection. Henrik even created a simple neural network to detect these artifacts, showcasing the impact of the VAE changes on image quality. Overall, these updates shed light on the evolving landscape of AI-generated content and the ongoing efforts to ensure responsible usage in this domain.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of AI-generated images, specifically focusing on the new SDXL-VAE 1.0 release by Stability AI. Here are the key points summarized from the comments:

1. **kkn** mentions the challenges in identifying images generated by VAE due to the complexity in mapping latent space to a large image space. They also discuss the logical flow of VAE and how it relates to human preferences and probability of false positives in real-world images.
2. **brgchck** talks about the ongoing battle between spy vs. spy in AI-generated content and the difficulties in detecting generated content like spam.
3. **tsych** discusses the difficulties in distinguishing between AI-generated and photographed images, highlighting the need to remove metadata for better accuracy. Other users further elaborate on the challenges faced in training neural networks for this purpose.
4. **HPsquared** questions the refinement process of image generation models for better distinguishing real images from generated ones, while **jncfhnb** mentions the evolving primary methods in this area.
5. **TrueDuality** finds the discussion interesting but does not provide further elaboration.
6. **Zetobal** mentions a shortcoming in transparency regarding latent spaces, while **29athrowaway** introduces a screening system to identify AI-like pictures.
7. **blt** simply adds the year 2023 to the conversation.

The discussion highlights the complexities and challenges in identifying AI-generated images, including the need for further refinement in image generation models and the ongoing efforts to improve detection methods.
