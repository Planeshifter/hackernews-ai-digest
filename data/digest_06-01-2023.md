#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/01/ftc_alexa_ring_amazon_settlement/) | 59 points | by [FridayoLeary](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FridayoLeary) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36149838)

Amazon's IoT devices have been accused of several privacy failures, leading to a $30.8m fine by America's Federal Trade Commission. Amazon's Ring home security camera subsidiary was accused of allowing any employee or contractor to access customer videos, with basic privacy and security measures reportedly absent. Hackers were able to take control of customers’ accounts, cameras and videos, with video data "stored unencrypted" on Ring's network. Staff were apparently not trained on how to handle data, with some using it abusively. The FTC has also criticised Amazon's Alexa devices over data retention policies.

The first comment discusses how Congress passes protection laws that result in companies sending funds outside of America, but there is little discussion on security issues with Huawei. The comment suggests that billions of dollars of funding should be given to big end companies, and their criminal leaders and managers should be held responsible for security failures. The comment also mentions that ignoring security vulnerabilities is irresponsible to customers and the community.

The second comment discusses how Ring employees had access to customer videos, with weak security and data breaches occurring in 2017-2018. Hackers gained access to sensitive information using a single IP address and slow attacks, and some employees reportedly watched and recorded female colleagues without permission. The comment also mentions that the attack destroyed the company's confidence in its communication model, and it was slow to verify stolen credentials.

The third comment sarcastically suggests that Jesus would be disappointed in how people are treated when it comes to privacy, with customers not being given enough privacy protection.

The fourth comment discusses how the FTC has criticized Amazon's IoT devices for their privacy failures, but some people are puzzled by the FTC's actions.
