### Mining JIT traces for missing optimizations with Z3

#### [Submission URL](https://pypy.org/posts/2024/07/mining-jit-traces-missing-optimizations-z3.html) | 34 points | by [matt_d](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=matt_d) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41018308)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about using Z3 to find possible optimizations in JIT traces of real benchmarks. The author describes a high-level approach where they run benchmarks, dump the JIT traces, translate integer operations into Z3 formulas, and then use Z3 to identify inefficient operations. By starting from optimized traces of real programs, the author avoids the combinatorial explosion of trying all possible instruction sequences. The post also includes pseudocode and examples of how Z3 is used to find inefficiencies in the traces. Overall, the approach aims to improve the efficiency of JIT optimization by identifying and reporting missing optimizations.

In the following discussion, there is a debate about the implementation of optimizations suggested based on JIT traces. One user, "ntx," recommends compiling traces accompanying optimizations sold training data with Long Short-Term Memory (LLM) and suggesting optimizations based on JIT traces. Another user, "nblr," mentions the importance of verifying the semantic correctness of optimizations by running tests on extracted traces from various source projects. They suggest that implementing suggested optimizations changes the runtime performance and highlights the need to validate these changes through testing.

On the other hand, user "dshrm" points out that the high-level Python source itself can be a valuable source for optimizations. They mention using Z3 for type inference and solving questions written in Python. User "nblr" adds that runtime information traces are pertinent for optimizations in this context. Additionally, the discussion touches on the idea of using AI to suggest optimizations, with one user suggesting that using AI to modify bytecode for faster execution could be a viable approach, as neural networks can provide logical suggestions for optimizations.

In the latest entry of "Working with AI," Dwayne Forde from Mantle dives into the intricacies of code conversion, shedding light on the challenges and solutions they faced when converting a prototype project into a production-ready codebase. Utilizing Gemini's 1.0 Pro release and a Language Model (LLM), they managed to streamline the process and save valuable developer time.

The article highlights the common reasons behind codebase conversions, such as improved maintainability, performance enhancements, accessing a larger talent pool, and adapting prototypes for production use. Mantle's unique approach involved translating code from R to Golang and ReactJS, focusing on capturing the logic and intent of the prototype while reducing boilerplate code to expedite the engineering process.

By leveraging a larger context window provided by Gemini's LLMs, Mantle was able to input prototype source code, derive existing code patterns, introduce target architecture summaries, include preferred libraries, and use screenshots as visual references to guide the code conversion process efficiently. This innovative strategy enabled Mantle to optimize their workflow and navigate the complexities of codebase conversions with precision and speed.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the article about Mantle's code conversion strategy involved various viewpoints on the process of translating code from one language to another for different purposes. The conversation touched on topics like the benefits and challenges of converting codebases, the implications of using AI tools like Gemini's LLMs for code translation, and considerations when converting prototype code to production-ready code in languages like Golang and ReactJS.

Several users shared their experiences and opinions on the effectiveness of converting codebases, with some highlighting the importance of maintaining the functionality and logic of the original code during the conversion process. Others discussed the potential risks and benefits of utilizing AI tools like Copilot for code translation, mentioning concerns about the accuracy and adaptability of such tools in different programming contexts.

The conversation also delved into the significance of understanding the nuances of different programming languages, the impact of language choice on software development projects, and the role of human expertise in ensuring the reliability and quality of code conversions. Users shared varied perspectives on the technical aspects and practical implications of code translation, emphasizing the need for a balance between automated tools and manual intervention in the process to achieve optimal outcomes.

### Show HN: QRaro, store binary data into QR Codes and retrieve it later

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/tcsenpai/qraro) | 15 points | by [tcsenpai](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tcsenpai) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41020909)

Today on Hacker News, a new Python module called "QR Code Encoder and Decoder" caught the attention of the tech community. This module allows users to encode arbitrary binary data into a series of QR codes and decode them back into the original data. It leverages the qrcode library for encoding and the zxing library for decoding.

The functionality of this module includes functions like `bin_to_qr()` which encodes binary data into QR code images and `qr_to_bin()` which decodes QR code images back into the original binary data. The users can specify parameters like chunk size and filename prefix for the generated QR code images.

The script also provides error handling for file not found and decoding errors, making it robust for practical usage scenarios. It is noted that the script automatically determines the appropriate QR code version based on the data size and handles binary data effectively, including non-printable characters.

Overall, this module offers a convenient and efficient way to work with QR codes in Python, making it a valuable tool for encoding and decoding data.

The discussion on the HN thread is mostly focused on the technical aspects of the QR Code Encoder and Decoder module. Users are impressed with the functionality of the module and appreciate how it simplifies the process of encoding and decoding binary data into QR codes. There is also a mention of the support provided by the module for reconstructing data from multiple QR codes scanned by a reader. Additionally, there is a brief conversation around the capacity of QR codes to store data efficiently and the use of base64 encoding for storing binary data within QR codes.
