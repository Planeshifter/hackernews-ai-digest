The state of Minnesota in the US has passed legislation that could force Amazon to improve labor conditions for warehouse workers. The pioneering workplace safety bill, which proponents say is the strongest labor protection legislation in the country for people laboring in Amazon-style warehouses, mandates that any warehouse employing more than 250 workers must provide the quotas and work speed metrics used to appraise worker performance. It also prohibits retaliation against those who have signed up to such union drives. Over 2,000 Amazon workers in eight nations recently participated in a survey which suggested that performance and monitoring systems had taken a physical and emotional toll on employees’ wellbeing.

KeePass, a popular password manager, is vulnerable to a newly discovered memory dumping exploit that can retrieve a user's master password in plaintext, even when the database is locked or the program is closed. While a fix is in the works and an unstable test version with mitigations is available, it is not guaranteed that the timeframe for the update targeting version 2.54 will be met. Other password managers compatible with KeePass database files, such as KeePassXC and Strongbox, are not affected. Users can protect themselves by avoiding untrusted individuals from accessing their computer, not clicking on unknown links, installing unknown software, using a reputable antivirus software and wiping their PC completely.

KeePass, a popular password manager, has been found to be vulnerable to a new exploit that allows an attacker to retrieve a user's master password in plaintext from the memory dump of the locked program or closed database. While a fix is being developed, users are advised to avoid untrusted software and protect their computers with reputable antivirus programs. Commenters suggest using alternative, secure password managers such as KeePassXC and Strongbox, and implementing measures such as encrypting swap files and using physical access controls to prevent an attacker from accessing the hard drive. There were also discussions about the weaknesses of single password management, recommendations to use special password books or wallets, and other secure password strategies. It was noted that KeePassXC provides a memory protection feature to help prevent memory being written to disk. Some users also discussed the benefits and drawbacks of writing down passwords.

#### [Submission URL](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2023/05/does-ai-mean-we-dont-need-the-semantic-web/) | 49 points | by [edent](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=edent) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36011067)

The question of whether AI makes the Semantic Web irrelevant is explored in a thought-provoking article on Edwin Brady's blog. While the Semantic Web relies on marking up HTML for machines to process, the development of AI means that machines can now interpret and understand text designed for humans. However, the article argues that standardized syntax and semantics are still extremely useful and necessary, and there are many cases where "AI" can't handle complex information yet. The article also discusses the challenges of unit testing and maintaining AI text-processing systems.

### EU approves new rules for tracing crypto transfers, introduces 1000€ limit

#### [Submission URL](https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20230414IPR80133/crypto-assets-green-light-to-new-rules-for-tracing-transfers-in-the-eu) | 56 points | by [yamrzou](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yamrzou) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36010621)

The European Parliament has passed new rules for tracing transfers of crypto-assets in the EU, marking the first piece of EU legislation regarding cryptocurrency transfers. This aims to ensure that crypto transfers can be traced and suspicious transactions can be blocked, with the same rules applying to transactions above €1000 from self-hosted wallets when interacting with hosted wallets managed by crypto-assets service providers. Additionally, new common rules on supervision, consumer protection, and environmental safeguards for crypto-assets were also approved, including crypto-currencies. The new legal framework will support market integrity, financial stability, and regulate public offers of crypto-assets. To reduce the high carbon footprint of crypto-currencies, significant service providers will have to disclose their energy consumption and the European Securities and Markets Authority will create a public register for non-compliant crypto-assets service providers.

The European Parliament has passed new legislation that mandates tracing of crypto transfers in the EU to block suspicious transfers and ensure market integrity, financial stability, and regulation of public offers of crypto-assets. The framework specifies that common rules shall apply to transactions above €1000 from self-hosted wallets, and this will strengthen consumer protection and include environmental safeguards for crypto-assets. Additionally, significant service providers will have to disclose their energy consumption, and a public register for non-compliant crypto-assets service providers will be created. However, users raise concerns that the €1000 limit does not solve the problem, and the rules could force individuals to switch to mainstream payment processors. The legislation could also be challenging for privacy coins like Monero. There are mixed opinions in the comments, with some users supporting the legislation while others criticize it.
