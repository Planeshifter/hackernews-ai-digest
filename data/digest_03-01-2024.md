#### [Submission URL](https://cgad.ski/blog/where-is-noethers-principle-in-machine-learning.html) | 275 points | by [cgadski](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cgadski) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39560862)

The post discusses the application of Noether's Principle to Machine Learning and its comparison with its usage in Physics. Noether's Principle in Physics relates continuous invariances of the action to conservation laws of the system. For instance, in the two-body problem, certain transformations are invariants for the action, leading to conserved quantities like momentum. In machine learning, processes involve choosing control parameters to minimize a quantity, such as in a deep residual network. The trajectory of values in machine learning can be viewed as a discrete-time process analogous to physical trajectories, albeit with differences in time and constraints. The post raises questions about applying Noether's theorem to these processes and finding meaningful conserved quantities, highlighting similarities and distinctions between physics and machine learning.

### A story of a large loop with a long instruction dependency chain

#### [Submission URL](https://johnnysswlab.com/a-story-of-a-very-large-loop-with-a-long-instruction-dependency-chain/) | 30 points | by [signa11](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=signa11) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39562194)

Johnny's Software Lab LLC delves into the intricate world of software performance. In a recent case study, they tackled a thorny performance issue involving a lengthy loop. Despite the loop being optimized with vector intrinsics, a high cycles per instruction (CPI) number hinted at underlying inefficiencies. Upon closer inspection, they uncovered a chain of instruction dependencies within the loop, dampening CPU performance.

To experiment with this scenario, a loop with a prolonged dependency chain but no loop-carried dependencies was constructed. By analyzing the impact of nested cosine calculations on CPI, they revealed a diminishing CPI trend as the dependency chain lengthened. Introducing interleaving as a solution to boost instruction level parallelism (ILP) proved effective but complex, raising concerns of register usage and code complexity.

Exploring an alternative approach, they employed loop fission to split the original loop into smaller segments, each handling a cosine calculation. This method, although not as efficient as interleaving, showed improvements in performance compared to the initial loop setup. By breaking down the loop into manageable chunks with temporary storage for intermediate results, the fissioned loop exhibited better performance outcomes.

In the realm of software performance optimization, Johnny's Software Lab LLC delves deep into the intricacies of code structure to enhance efficiency and execution speed.

- User "tmnd" commented on the post mentioning concerns about bandwidth consumption.
- User "jrt" discussed coding with AVX2 and the challenges of handling multiple data product dependencies, mentioning the performance differences seen in MKL. They experimented with Linked L1 cache but did not see improvements.
- User "pltcn" flagged the post, stating that the comment by "mrkbrns" seemed like punch line and not relevant to the discussion. They pointed out that the comment was intended to provide feedback on the study tackled by Johnny's Software Lab LLC.
