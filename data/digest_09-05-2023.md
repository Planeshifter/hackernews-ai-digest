### Gizmodo fires Spanish staff amid switch to AI translator

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-took-my-job-literally-gizmodo-fires-spanish-staff-amid-switch-to-ai-translator/) | 55 points | by [stalfosknight](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stalfosknight) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37399336)

Last week, Gizmodo en Espa√±ol, the Spanish-language site of parent company G/O Media, fired its staff and replaced them with AI translations of English-language articles. The move has been met with criticism, as some of the AI-translated articles contain glitches and sudden switches from Spanish to English. This trend of media companies using AI tools to maximize content output while minimizing costs is controversial within the journalism community. While AI translation technology has improved, it still cannot fully replace human translators and can result in subtle errors and lack of cultural knowledge. Despite the potential negative implications, many media companies continue to experiment with AI-written content.

The discussion revolves around the quality of GPT-4 translations and the limitations of machine translation systems. Some users argue that GPT-4 translations, especially for languages like Korean and Japanese, are not accurate and struggle with context and cultural nuances. They note that the lack of certain grammatical elements and the difficulty in translating stylized or metaphorical texts are major challenges for machine translation. However, others point out that GPT-4 has made significant improvements in translation, and some even claim that it surpasses other translation services like DeepL and Google Translate. It is also highlighted that machine translation systems like GPT-4 can handle tasks that human translators wouldn't expect, such as jokes and technical writing. Overall, the debate emphasizes the need for human translation and the limitations of machine translation tools, particularly in capturing cultural and contextual nuances. Some users express concern over the impact on translation industry professionals who may see their work affected or diminished by the rise of AI translation.

### Android 14 blocks all modification of system certificates, even as root?

#### [Submission URL](https://httptoolkit.com/blog/android-14-breaks-system-certificate-installation/) | 312 points | by [pimterry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pimterry) | [234 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37391521)

In the latest release of Android, Android 14 (API v34), modifications to system certificates have been further restricted, even on fully rooted devices. This move marks a departure from Android's initial promise of openness and user control. Previously, users were able to modify the set of trusted certificates on their devices, but with Android 14, this becomes much more challenging. The set of certificate authorities (CAs) on a device determines the security of encrypted network traffic, and restricting user control over this can have significant implications for privacy and security research, app debugging, and enterprise network configurations. While rooting Android devices has been a workaround to these limitations, it is not officially endorsed by Google. In the past, rooted devices allowed users to manually add trusted certificates to the system store through file modifications. However, this process can be complex, as the /system directory is typically read-only. Workarounds include making the /system directory writable or mounting a temporary read-write file system. These methods have been effective in providing interception setups on rooted Android devices and emulators, enabling developers and researchers to analyze app communications. However, with the tighter restrictions in Android 14, these methods may become less effective. Overall, this shift towards limited user control highlights the ongoing tension between openness and vendor control in the Android ecosystem.

The discussion on this submission primarily revolves around the limitations and implications of the tighter restrictions on modifying system certificates in Android 14. Some users express concerns about the potential impact on privacy and security research, app debugging, and enterprise network configurations. There are discussions about workarounds on rooted devices, including making the /system directory writable or mounting a temporary read-write file system. Some users highlight the tension between openness and vendor control in the Android ecosystem. 

Other discussions touch on topics such as modifying system certificates on vanilla Android, the risks and dangers of unauthorized modifications to the OS, and the security and privacy implications of such modifications. There are also discussions about the benefits and drawbacks of using custom ROMs and the challenges faced by developers and users in finding overlaps between custom ROMs and necessary apps, such as banking apps.

### Stadiums Are Already Using Facial Recognition at Games

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/9-stadiums-using-facial-recognition-games-rose-bowl-met-1850798207) | 23 points | by [ourmandave](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ourmandave) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37394736)

Facial recognition technology is being increasingly used in sports stadiums across the US, but privacy advocates are raising concerns. The Philadelphia Phillies baseball team recently introduced a facial recognition authentication method called "Go-Ahead Entry" to decrease wait times at entry gates, but the system encountered glitches, causing security to create a "buffer zone" for the cameras. Other sports stadiums, including the New York Mets and the Cleveland Guardians, have also implemented facial recognition systems to speed up entry. However, critics argue that the technology does not work well for women or non-white individuals. A coalition of artists, including Rage Against the Machine, has pledged to boycott performing at stadiums that use facial recognition technology.

The discussion around the submission revolves around the use of facial recognition technology in sports stadiums. One commenter highlights the benefits of the technology, mentioning that it greatly reduces the time taken to find missing children, which is a frequent occurrence. Another commenter adds that the technology can also log where and when tickets are scanned. However, there are concerns raised about privacy and the technology's effectiveness, particularly for women and non-white individuals. One artist coalition has even pledged to boycott stadiums that use facial recognition technology. 

In another thread, a user criticizes those who complain about facial recognition, stating that the technology improves over time. They also argue that the concerns at Madison Square Garden (MSG) are exaggerated, as the headlines just represent the opinions of a few individuals. However, another commenter points out that the use of facial recognition in MSG has drawn criticism for its impact on privacy and its potential to disproportionately affect women and non-white individuals.

Another user shares their personal experience, discussing how their company's software for controlling video feeds in a stadium recognized faces, objects like backpacks and guns, and detected tampering. They mention that the system had specific steps triggered for different events, including spotting blacklisted individuals. They add that the company had hired regional architects and an Israeli project manager to develop the software.

In a different comment, a person shares their anecdote about the San Francisco Giants' game day, mentioning their confusion with metal detectors and cameras when attempting to enter using their StubHub tickets. They express concerns about the potential dangers of the technology.

Another user highlights the dystopian and conservative nature of facial recognition being implemented in public places such as California. They mention encountering systems in Japan and Houston but express anger and frustration over the rapid adoption of the technology in the Bay Area, where they have experienced it firsthand, including managing a traced engineering team in India.

In a final comment, a user criticizes the lack of discussion around facial recognition technology in general terms. They argue that people only seem to care when it directly affects them and their freedom and democracy, drawing a parallel to the lack of discussion about voting booth surveillance.
