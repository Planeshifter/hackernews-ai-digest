In a shocking turn of events, a professor at Texas A&M University-Commerce used an AI tool called ChatGPT to detect plagiarism in his students' essays. However, the tool itself was found to be the plagiarizer, wrongly claiming that the students had copied from it. The professor had to give everyone in the course an incomplete grade.

### Music publishers sue AI company Anthropic over song lyrics

#### [Submission URL](https://www.reuters.com/legal/music-publishers-sue-ai-company-anthropic-over-song-lyrics-2023-10-18/) | 14 points | by [dndn1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dndn1) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37940732)

Music publishers Universal Music, ABKCO, and Concord have filed a lawsuit against artificial intelligence company Anthropic in Tennessee federal court. The publishers accuse Anthropic of misusing copyrighted song lyrics to train its chatbot Claude. According to the lawsuit, Anthropic violates the publishers' rights by using lyrics from at least 500 songs without obtaining permission. This appears to be the first case involving song lyrics and the use of copyrighted material to train generative-AI systems. Anthropic, which has received financial backing from Google, Amazon, and former cryptocurrency billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, has not yet responded to the lawsuit.

The discussion begins with a comment that speculates about the potential consequences of an advanced AI developed by Anthropic. The commenter suggests that it could lead to the downfall of civilization if intellectual property laws are not carefully regulated to prevent AI systems from accessing copyrighted material. Another user responds, expressing concern about the potential harm to websites hosting song lyrics that engage in copyright infringement. The discussion then veers off-topic with a remark about the role-playing game genre, followed by a comment suggesting that the lawsuit should be dismissed promptly. Lastly, a user dismisses the idea of licensing song lyrics as being silly.
