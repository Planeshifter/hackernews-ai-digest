#### [Submission URL](https://musiccontrolnet.github.io/web/) | 48 points | by [GaggiX](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GaggiX) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38268271)

Today's top story on Hacker News is a research paper titled "Music ControlNet: Multiple Time-varying Controls for Music Generation." The paper discusses a new music generation model called Music ControlNet, which offers multiple precise, time-varying controls over generated audio.

While text control has been previously used to manipulate global musical attributes like genre, mood, and tempo, it is less suitable for controlling time-varying attributes such as the positions of beats in time or the changing dynamics of the music. Music ControlNet addresses this limitation by proposing a diffusion-based conditional generative model that allows creators to input controls that are only partially specified in time.

The researchers evaluate the model by generating music based on controls extracted from audio and controls provided by creators. The results show that Music ControlNet is capable of generating realistic music that corresponds to the control inputs. Compared to a recent model called MusicGen, Music ControlNet generates music that is 49% more faithful to input melodies despite having fewer parameters and training on less data.

The paper includes examples of generated music and feature plots with different control combinations, including melody, dynamics, and rhythm. The examples demonstrate the capabilities of the Music ControlNet model in producing high-quality music with precise control over time-varying attributes.

Overall, Music ControlNet represents a significant advancement in music generation models, offering multiple precise controls over generated audio and improving the fidelity of generated music compared to existing models. The research has the potential to contribute to the development of more sophisticated and customizable music generation systems.

In the discussion on Hacker News, user "TaylorAlexander" mentions that they believe recent research in multimodal text modeling has probably laid a strong foundation for music sound generation models. They suggest that building on foundational models, such as generating niche models for 3D model generation, could be an interesting area to explore.

"SpaceManNabs" comments that they understand the paper discusses controls and wishes for more detail about how these controls differ from other methods of music generation, such as MusicLM and MusicGen.

"bongwater_OS" shares their appreciation for a particular song related to music research at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU).

"GaggiX" expresses curiosity about the model size, questioning if it is a small model of 41M or a larger one.

Finally, "brrrrrm" simply says they will give it a try, presumably referring to the Music ControlNet model.
