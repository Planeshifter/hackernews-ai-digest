### Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean AI's not after you

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/11/14/bt_horse_and_ai_are_the_same/) | 60 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38263386)

In an interview with Raconteur, Harmeen Mehta, BT's chief digital innovation officer, addressed concerns about AI replacing human jobs by stating that horses did not complain or go on strike when cars were invented. She argued that society changes, jobs evolve, and new ones are created, implying that the same will happen with the rise of AI. Mehta criticized the media for creating paranoia around AI and emphasized the importance of humans and AI working together. BT, which is undergoing its own transformation involving AI, plans to incorporate upskilling into its programs to ensure employees can adapt to the technological revolution. While Mehta's comments received mixed reactions, it is clear that AI's impact on jobs is still a topic of discussion and debate.

The discussion on the article revolves around various topics such as Pascal's wager, global warming, and the implementation of Universal Basic Income (UBI).

One commenter argues that there is a 1% chance of catastrophic global warming occurring, and that taking action to mitigate it is worth the risk. Another commenter compares this to Pascal's wager, where the existence of a spaghetti monster is used as an example. They argue that it is worth "wasting" a little bit of time and resources to worship the spaghetti monster in case it actually exists.

The topic of global warming then leads to a discussion on technology and its impact. One commenter argues that the threat of AI is based on reasonable predictions, while another suggests that it is unlikely for AI to surpass human capabilities in certain fields. They also discuss the idea of a copywriter/model/photographer being replaced by AI and whether that would be reasonable or not.

The discussion then shifts to the topic of UBI. One commenter argues that UBI depends on expected infinite economic growth. They mention that if the economy grows, taxes increase, making it possible to fund UBI. Another commenter suggests that if the economy grows, UBI will become necessary as a large percentage of jobs will be automated. However, another commenter points out that UBI assumes a complete shift away from traditional physical labor and questions whether that is feasible.

The conversation then goes on to discuss the potential of exponential growth of UBI and its implications. One commenter suggests that when robots replace jobs, UBI can be used to distribute goods evenly in society. Another commenter argues that UBI doesn't mean people will stop working, but rather it allows individuals to pursue their own interests and start businesses without the fear of financial ruin.

The discussion ends with a comment on the material requirements of modern life and the desire for environmental factors driving the need for UBI. They conclude that they will stop talking about it for now.
