#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02113) | 446 points | by [wuubuu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wuubuu) | [113 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43390400)

In the bustling world of machine learning research, Andrew Gordon Wilson proposes a provocative take on deep neural networks in his newly submitted paper, "Deep Learning is Not So Mysterious or Different," on arXiv. Challenging the commonly held perception of deep learning as an inscrutable outlier, Wilson suggests that these networks aren't as unique in generalization behaviors as many believe. Mystifying concepts like benign overfitting and double descent can be demystified through established generalization frameworks, such as PAC-Bayes and countable hypothesis bounds.

A key element of Wilson's argument is the notion of soft inductive biases, which advocate for a broad hypothesis space while leaning toward simpler solutions that align with available data. This approach isn't exclusive to deep learning; it can be applied across various model classes, suggesting that the singularity attributed to deep learning may be overstated.

However, Wilson does acknowledge the distinct elements of deep learning, like its representation learning capabilities, mode connectivity phenomena, and its comparative universality. If you're intrigued by the ongoing discourse about the nature and future of deep learning, this paper promises to be a compelling read. You can access it directly via arXiv for a deeper dive into Wilson's insights.

### Akira ransomware can be cracked with sixteen RTX 4090 GPUs in around ten hours

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/cyber-security/akira-ransomware-cracked-with-rtx-4090-new-exploit-to-brute-force-encryption-attack) | 147 points | by [Ozarkian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ozarkian) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43387188)

In a recent breakthrough, the notorious Akira ransomware attack has been partially thwarted by a blogger known as Tinyhack. Thanks to an innovative GPU-based brute-force method, Tinyhack has successfully decrypted files encrypted by Akira ransomware, potentially saving companies from succumbing to hefty ransom demands. The exploit leverages powerful GPUs, such as the Nvidia RTX 4090, to crack the encryption in as little as seven days for a typical setup, or just over ten hours with a 16-GPU configuration. 

The Akira ransomware, infamous for targeting high-profile organizations and demanding exorbitant ransoms, uses complex encryption techniques like chacha8 and Kcipher2. These methods involve creating per-file encryption keys using precise timestamps, which can be reverse-engineered through brute-force computing if conditions are right. However, for this decryption to be successful, the integrity of the encrypted files must remain intact and precise timestamps must be traceable.

Though Tinyhack's discovery marks a significant win in cybersecurity, it's also a race against time, as those behind Akira are likely to update their encryption methods to block such counterattacks. Organizations affected by Akira can refer to Tinyhack's detailed blog post for a comprehensive guide on leveraging this exploit to regain access to their data. This development not only offers hope to victims of the Akira attack but also emphasizes the evolving battleground of ransomware defense, showcasing how tech-savvy individuals can help tilt the scales in favor of cybersecurity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Akira Ransomware Decryption Breakthrough:**

   - Parallel processing efficiency and "embarrassingly parallel" tasks are emphasized, with debate over scalability limitations (e.g., PCIe bandwidth, memory constraints). Some users noted that cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS H100 instances) could reduce decryption time to ~13 hours at a cost of ~$60.  

2. **Cost Analysis and Cloud Alternatives:**  
   - Cloud GPU rentals (e.g., Lambda’s 8x H100 instances at $31.46/hr) were proposed as cost-effective alternatives to physical hardware. However, users debated whether ransomware operators would adapt encryption methods to render brute-force attacks obsolete, reducing long-term utility.  

3. **Cybersecurity Practices and Backups:**  
   - Many comments criticized companies for poor backup practices (e.g., storing passwords in plaintext, inadequate disaster recovery plans). Small businesses were singled out as particularly vulnerable, often lacking resources for advanced tools like XDR (Extended Detection and Response).  
   - XDR’s role in detecting threats (e.g., abnormal file changes, process behavior) was praised, but its adoption is rare outside large enterprises. Users joked that backups are often stored on "NAS drives in a closet" with minimal testing.  

4. **Ransomware Economics and Adaptability:**  
   - The economics of ransomware attacks were dissected: hackers prioritize low-effort, high-reward targets, while victims weigh ransom payments against recovery costs. Some users questioned whether decrypting files retroactively would deter future attacks, as ransomware groups could simply update their encryption methods.  

5. **Skepticism and Future Implications:**  
   - While Tinyhack’s method offers hope, users warned it’s a temporary fix. Akira’s operators are likely to patch vulnerabilities, emphasizing the cat-and-mouse nature of cybersecurity.  
   - A sub-thread humorously compared ransomware to "extinct dinosaurs" if backups were reliable, but reality paints a grimmer picture due to widespread negligence.  

**Key Takeaway:**
