### Copyright liability for generative AI pivots on fair use doctrine

#### [Submission URL](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/copyright-liability-for-generative-ai-pivots-on-fair-use-doctrine) | 27 points | by [hhs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hhs) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37645974)

Gibson Dunn attorneys analyzed the legal questions surrounding generative AI and its impact on copyright law. The Copyright Office recently requested comments on the effects of generative AI on creative industries and the copyright system. Lawsuits have already been filed by authors and creators, including Sarah Silverman and George R.R. Martin, claiming that using preexisting copyrighted materials to train generative AI systems infringes their rights. The fair use analysis for generative AI involves determining if the system infringes by incorporating copyrighted material and if the output produced infringes the original work. The courts will consider factors such as the transformative purpose, market effects, and substantial similarity of the AI-generated output. The analysis will focus on how AI systems imitate the style of original works, whether they produce new outputs without using elements from the originals, and how they parody the voice or style of creators.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of generative AI and its impact on copyright law.  One user points out that generative AI does not actually copy underlying works, but rather generates new works based on patterns and examples it has been trained on. They argue that the existing copyright law should apply to AI models, as they typically contain copies of works that they have been trained on.

Another user argues that whether or not AI models copy underlying works is irrelevant. They believe that the point is that AI models can compete with and potentially generate works that rival human creations. The discussion also touches on the commercial aspect of copying books and the potential for AI models to generate works that replicate recognizable watermarks, which is seen as hilariously ironic. Another user brings up the fair use analysis and states that the determination of infringement depends on whether the AI-generated output infringes the original work. There is also a discussion about the issue of citations and how AI-generated works could potentially result in finished works that include citations and critical reviews. The role of intellectual property and the challenges it faces in the age of AI are also discussed. One user argues that high-quality films, music, and books require significant resources to create, but today's technology allows for easy duplication and distribution without proper protection. Some users express skepticism about the ability of AI to genuinely create new and original works, arguing that AI can only imitate what humans have already done. The discussion concludes with a comment about the importance of creativity and the need for intellectual property laws to adapt to the changing times.
