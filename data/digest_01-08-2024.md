A technique called "fuzzing," originally developed in the 1980s to find instabilities in UNIX command-line prompts, is being retooled to automate chip tests on the assembly line and discover bugs that could lead to hardware vulnerabilities. Fuzzing involves introducing commands and prompts to a chip that are not quite correct, which triggers erratic responses that can point researchers to potential weak links in the system. This technique saves time as it can be automated and executed multiple times during product development. In a recent study, researchers used reinforcement learning to select inputs for fuzz testing, making the process more efficient and faster.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to fuzzing and testing. Some users mention that fuzzing is effective for finding bugs in popular software and can be used to test chip designs. Others argue that fuzzing is not a substitute for traditional testing and that it mainly finds surface-level issues. The use of reinforcement learning in fuzzing is also discussed, with some users mentioning that it can make the process more efficient and faster. There is debate about the effectiveness of fuzzing in hardware validation, with some users questioning its ability to validate complex hardware designs. The limitations of existing hardware fuzzers are also debated, with suggestions for new approaches using multi-armed bandit algorithms. The discussion also touches on the importance of security in hardware design and the existence of prior work on the subject.

#### [Submission URL](https://aiguide.substack.com/p/an-ai-breakthrough-on-systematic) | 46 points | by [picometer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=picometer) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38916596)

In a recent paper, researchers Brenden Lake and Marco Baroni presented a neural network that demonstrates "human-like systematic generalization" in language understanding. This is significant because neural networks have traditionally struggled with this kind of generalization, where they can understand and produce related sentences if they can understand or produce a particular sentence. The researchers created a set of puzzles that tested this ability and found that their neural network performed on par with humans, including making similar errors. The media covered this as an "AI Breakthrough" and a method for helping AI "generalize like people do." However, there is still debate over the extent to which this achievement fulfills those enthusiastic characterizations.

The discussion on this submission focuses on the significance and limitations of the research paper. 
User "sgt101" finds the paper interesting and suggests that it makes some fascinating contributions to the field of AI, particularly in abstract reasoning. They also mention the importance of in-depth reviews of such papers.
User "shrmntnktp" provides three points to consider. Firstly, they refer to Betteridge's law of headlines, which suggests that the answer to any headline question is most likely "no." Secondly, they mention a study that involved 25 participants from Mechanical Turk, implying that the sample size is small and the results may not be directly comparable to human performance. Lastly, they express skepticism about the media coverage of this research, emphasizing the need for scrutiny and caution when interpreting results.
User "vrptr" engages with "shrmntnktp" and asks for clarification on their criticism. 
User "shrmntnktp" responds, agreeing that the sample size of 25 is small and may not adequately characterize human reasoning. They argue that this is a classic problem in psychology and AI research, where small sample sizes often lead to claims that do not hold up to scrutiny. They emphasize the need for a stronger foundation and extrapolation of the results.
