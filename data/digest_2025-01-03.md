In a fascinating retrospective, Steve Krouse chronicles the journey of Val Town, a platform for code hosting that has rapidly evolved to meet user demands for advanced code generation tools. Starting from the launch of GitHub Copilot in 2022, Krouse highlights how Val Town has made a series of initiatives to keep up with the fast-paced advancements in AI code assistants.

The evolution began with experimenting with GitHub Copilot-like features, leading to the integration of ChatGPT as an autocomplete service, albeit with limitations. Driven by user requests, Val Town transitioned to Codeium for faster and more accurate completions. As AI tools evolved, Krouse detailed the challenges and innovations sparked by tools like ChatGPT's tool-use features and the groundbreaking Claude Artifacts, which greatly enhanced the code generation process and allowed for a more efficient feedback loop.

Despite the intense competition and the pitfalls of "fast-follow" strategies, Krouse notes that Val Town has endeavored to contribute to the space by improving the speed of code generation through techniques like generating diffs. This iterative approach, while not always reliable, underscores their commitment to refining user experience. 

Ultimately, this insightful piece not only celebrates past achievements but also highlights the importance of adaptation and innovation in a crowded and rapidly evolving landscape of code generation technology.

### Can LLMs write better code if you keep asking them to “write better code”?

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/01/write-better-code/) | 720 points | by [rcarmo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rcarmo) | [418 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42584400)

In a recent experiment that highlights the evolving capabilities of AI tools in coding, one user sought to explore iterative prompting with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Anthropic's latest AI model. After the trend of users creatively pushing boundaries with DALL-E 3 images fizzled out, the user surmised if a similar approach could be applied to coding. The inquiry involved taking a simple Python problem — finding the difference between the smallest and largest numbers in a generated list of random integers where their digits sum to 30 — and asking the LLM, iteratively, to improve the code.

The initial implementation was a straightforward yet effective solution that a novice could produce, providing robust handling for edge cases. However, what followed was an engaging dialogue between the user and Claude, where they asked the AI to "make the code better." This led to an impressive refactor into a more object-oriented design, showcasing not just the AI's prowess in coding but also a potential leap in productivity for software engineers.

The experiment draws attention to the notion that iterative prompting can lead to substantial improvements in code quality — raising questions about the boundaries of such iterations. As AI continues to evolve, perhaps we may soon see what the “cosmic” equivalent of code might look like. This exploration signals a promising future for AI-assisted development, pushing users to rethink how they engage with these powerful tools. The full conversation thread is available on GitHub for those interested in the iterative journey and the evolving outputs of the AI.

In the discussion surrounding the AI experiment with Claude 3.5 Sonnet, a variety of perspectives emerged regarding the iterative prompting methodology applied to coding tasks. Participants highlighted the effectiveness and speed of AI in optimizing code for finding the difference between the largest and smallest numbers in lists with digit sums equal to 30. Some contributors pointed out potential performance enhancements, suggesting native optimizations could lead to significant speed improvements compared to straightforward implementations.

Several commenters expressed skepticism about the necessity of certain optimizations, arguing that while the improvements were fascinating, they might not yield considerable practical benefits for all tasks. A few users praised the AI’s ability to handle complex scenarios effectively, while others raised concerns about the inherent limitations of large language models in producing entirely correct and efficient solutions.

Some comments also focused on the implications of AI in coding practices, questioning the dependence on AI for generating sophisticated algorithms. There was a consensus that while AI tools like Claude can enhance development workflows by providing high-quality suggestions, users still need to be cautious and aware of the limits of current AI capabilities.

Ultimately, the discussion underscored a blend of appreciation for AI's evolving roles in coding with a critical eye towards managing expectations in terms of efficiency and accuracy, while acknowledging the exciting future possibilities of AI-assisted programming.
