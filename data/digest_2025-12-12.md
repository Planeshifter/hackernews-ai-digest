### OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/) | 495 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [291 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46250332)

What’s new
- ChatGPT (Code Interpreter) now ships with a /home/oai/skills directory containing built-in skills for spreadsheets, DOCX, and PDFs. You can even ask it to “Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills” to inspect them.
- For PDFs and office docs, ChatGPT converts pages to PNG and runs them through a vision-enabled model to preserve layout/graphics—rather than just extracting text.
- OpenAI’s open-source Codex CLI has “experimental support for skills.md.” Any folder in ~/.codex/skills is treated as a skill; run with --enable skills to use them.

Hands-on findings (Simon Willison)
- ChatGPT used the new PDF skill end-to-end to research and generate a formatted PDF about rimu mast and kākāpō breeding, explicitly citing “Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines.” It iterated on fonts to correctly render macrons, taking ~11 minutes.
- In Codex CLI, Willison installed a Datasette plugin–authoring skill and had Codex generate a working plugin that exposes a cowsay route—demonstrating skills as drop-in capabilities for coding agents.

Why it matters
- Convergence: OpenAI appears to be embracing the same lightweight, filesystem-based “skills” concept Anthropic introduced—folders with a SKILL.md (or skill.md) plus assets/scripts.
- Portability and composability: Skills are easy to author, version, share, and audit. They encourage reproducible agent behavior without complex orchestration frameworks.
- Path to a de facto standard: With both Anthropic and OpenAI leaning in, a common spec feels within reach—Willison suggests the Agentic AI Foundation could steward documentation.

Try it yourself
- ChatGPT: Ask it to zip /home/oai/skills to see what’s inside.
- Codex CLI: Place a skill folder in ~/.codex/skills and run codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2, then prompt “list skills”.

Takeaway
Skills are quickly moving from neat idea to cross-vendor primitive for agentic workflows. If they get formalized, they could become the simplest shared standard for extending LLMs with auditable, reusable capabilities.

**The "Skills" Pattern: Context Engineering Standardized**
Commenters largely view the "skills" concept not as a technological breakthrough, but as a standardization of existing "context engineering" techniques. Users like `_pdp_` and `electric_muse` describe skills as essentially instruction-mode prompts (similar to `.cursorrules` or `Copilot AGENT.md`) that dynamically extend the model's base prompt. The consensus is that while the implementation is simple—often just 20-30 lines of code to watch a folder—formalizing it creates a powerful shared primitive for managing specialized knowledge without cluttering the context window.

**Implementation Strategies and "Self-Optimizing" Workflows**
The discussion highlights how developers are already iterating on this concept:
*   **Lazy Loading:** `Jimmc414` and `cube2222` point out that skills act as "lazy loaded prompt engineering." Instead of burning tokens on a massive system prompt, the agent only loads the specific instructions/assets when the skill is invoked, making it efficient for complex agents.
*   **From Text to Code:** `DonHopkins` proposes a "Self Optimizing Skills" workflow. A user starts with a Markdown instruction file; as they refine the prompt through trial and error, they eventually convert reproducible logic into deterministic Python CLI tools (using `argparse`) that the LLM can reliable invoke, documenting the tool for the AI within the code itself.
*   **Testing:** `electric_muse` suggests including integration tests within skill folders, allowing the AI to verify it understands the skill before applying it.

**Anthropic Innovation vs. OpenAI Scale**
A sub-thread debates the product landscape, with `xtr` noting that OpenAI appears to be playing catch-up to Anthropic’s "sticky, simple, obvious" product innovations (like Artifacts and Skills).
*   While `sigmoid10` argues that OpenAI’s massive user base and valuation dwarf Anthropic's, others (`ramraj07`, `dtnchn`) counter that Anthropic has captured the "real work" demographic.
*   Several developers mention that despite OpenAI's volume, they use Claude for coding because the output is higher quality, and features like Skills represent a better understanding of developer workflows.

### Using secondary school maths to demystify AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/secondary-school-maths-showing-that-ai-systems-dont-think/) | 120 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [237 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245731)

Teaching AI with school math: CAMMP shows how to demystify ML in the classroom

A team from KIT’s CAMMP program and the University of Salzburg argues you don’t need advanced CS to teach AI fundamentals—just the math already in secondary curricula. Their classroom-ready workshops use real AI contexts to make algebra, geometry, and stats feel relevant while dismantling the “AI thinks” myth.

What they do
- Reframe standard math topics through ML tasks: decision trees (privacy in social networks), k-NN (Netflix recommendations), n-grams (word prediction), regression and simple neural nets (life expectancy), and SVMs (traffic-light color classification).
- Walk students (ages ~17–18 for SVM) through plotting data, finding separating lines/planes, choosing “best” via margins, validating with test sets and confusion matrices, and discussing trade-offs.
- Bake in ethics: bias, data diversity, privacy, and asymmetric error costs (e.g., false green vs. false red in autonomous driving).

How it’s taught
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks with fill-in-the-gaps code; no installs or prior programming required.
- Direct feedback, scaffolded hints, and alignment to Austrian/German math standards (vectors, dot products, distances, planes, statistical measures).

Why it matters
- A practical blueprint for AI literacy that leverages existing math classes, making ML less “black box,” more transparent—and more engaging—for teens and teachers.

While the submission focuses on an educational blueprint to teach machine learning via high school mathematics, the Hacker News discussion largely bypassed the curriculum itself to debate the article's premise that mathematical explanations disprove that "AI thinks."

*   **The Definition of "Thinking":** The assertion that "machines don't think" sparked a philosophical debate regarding the Turing Test and John Searle’s "Chinese Room" argument. Users debated whether the distinction between intrinsic understanding (human) and extrinsic results (AI) matters if the output is indistinguishable. One commenter cited Dijkstra’s aphorism that "the question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim."
*   **Biological vs. Artificial Cognition:** Several users challenged the reductionist view that "AI is just math," arguing that human cognition could similarly be reduced to "just biology" or physics. This led to comparisons between LLM context windows and human short-term memory, with debates over whether human memory is superior due to continuity or inferior due to "lossy" recall.
*   **Title Change:** The thread became so consumed by the philosophical definition of thought that the moderator `dng` altered the post title (removing the phrase "machines don't think") to redirect focus back to the educational mathematics content.
*   **Educational Feasibility:** A minority of comments addressed the curriculum, with some wishing such classes existed during their schooling, while others expressed skepticism about whether average secondary school teachers are equipped to teach ML concepts effectively.

### Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers

#### [Submission URL](https://vulpinecitrus.info/blog/guarding-git-forge-ai-scrapers/) | 164 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [115 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46241849)

Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers — a self‑hoster’s war story and playbook. After their public Forgejo instance was hammered by hundreds of thousands of requests per day from thousands of IPs, lux (~lymkwi) dissects why forges are irresistible to scrapers, what it cost in CPU/power, and the layered defenses that finally worked.

Highlights
- Why forges attract scrapers: Every commit multiplies pages (file views, dirs, raw, blame, diffs, commit summaries). Using Linux as a thought experiment, they estimate a single repo exposes ~324 billion scrapeable pages. Modern scrapers ignore robots.txt and re-hit links endlessly.
- The real costs: VM pegged at 99–100% CPU (8 cores) and heavy RAM, page renders >15s, and a measurable power draw increase (~20–50W depending on setup), roughly €60/year just from scraping.
- Reverse-proxy caching: Put Nginx in front to cache hot paths and offload Forgejo. Careful cache keys and path classes keep legitimate pages fast while starving bots of dynamic work.
- Path-aware rate limiting: Separate buckets for expensive endpoints (blame/diff/raw/commit views) with strict per-IP limits; cheap endpoints get looser limits. Serve 429s with backoff to throttle churn.
- Active poisoning and traps: “Iocaine” and “Nam-Shub-of-Enki” detect likely bots and redirect them to a garbage generator that serves convincing but useless content, polluting would‑be training data and wasting scraper cycles.
- Automatic classifier: Behavior-based heuristics (link-walking patterns, header anomalies, ignoring assets/robots, path entropy, no cookies) route clients into allow/limit/poison buckets. Works across distributed IPs.
- Monitoring and tuning: Dashboards to track Iocaine hits, status codes, path-class load, and power/CPU impact; iterate rules to minimize collateral damage to humans and CI.
- Results: Latency and CPU returned to normal, power usage dropped, and the forge became usable again without making everything private.

Takeaway: If you run a public git forge in 2025, assume you’re targetable at industrial scale. Put a cache in front, classify by request cost, rate-limit aggressively, set honeypots, and don’t rely on robots.txt. The author shares configs and names their poison tools with a wink to The Princess Bride and Snow Crash—fitting for a fight that’s part ops, part adversarial theater.

The discussion around the submission focuses on practical configuration changes, the ethics of geoblocking, and the nature of the attacking traffic.

**Key themes in the discussion include:**

*   **Configuration Defenses:** Several users pointed out that enabling `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW` in Gitea/Forgejo configurations is a highly effective, low-effort solution. This setting forces authentication to view code and history (the expensive pages to render) while potentially leaving lighter pages accessible, drastically reducing server load and bandwidth usage.
*   **The Geoblocking Debate:** A significant portion of the conversation revolved completely blocking traffic from specific countries (e.g., Russia, Iran, India). While proponents argued that this reduces malicious traffic to near zero, opponents lamented that it breaks the ideal of a "borderless internet," unfairly punishes legitimate users in those regions, and creates headaches for travelers or expats trying to access services from abroad.
*   **Public vs. Private Hosting:** Some commenters questioned the necessity of running a public-facing forge at all, suggesting that personal instances should remain behind Wireguard or Tailscale. Others pushed back, arguing that keeping the internet open and sharing code publicly is a value worth defending despite the scrapers.
*   **The Nature of the Traffic:** Users speculated on the origin of the "thousands of IPs." The consensus leaned toward "residential proxies"—botnets comprised of compromised devices or users who unknowingly opted into bandwidth sharing via VPN apps—rather than individual tinkerers.
*   **Data Poisoning:** A tangent emerged regarding "LLM grooming" and "data poisoning," with users discussing the potential for state actors (specifically Russia) or individuals to intentionally pollute training data to influence future AI models.

### New Kindle feature uses AI to answer questions about books

#### [Submission URL](https://reactormag.com/new-kindle-feature-ai-answer-questions-books-authors/) | 80 points | by [mindracer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindracer) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248417)

Amazon quietly rolled out “Ask this Book,” an AI Q&A feature inside the Kindle iOS app (US only) that answers questions about the book you’re reading—things like plot details, character relationships, and themes—while promising “spoiler‑free” responses. Amazon says answers are short, based on the book’s factual content, visible only to people who bought/borrowed the title, and are non-shareable/non-copyable.

Controversy erupted fast: there’s no way for authors or publishers to opt out, and many weren’t notified. Amazon declined to explain the legal basis, technical design, hallucination safeguards, or whether the system protects texts from AI training. Publishing insiders are calling it, effectively, an in‑book chatbot, and raising concerns that AI-generated outputs tied to a specific copyrighted work could be seen as derivative or infringing.

The launch follows other bumpy AI experiments at Amazon (error‑filled TV recaps that were paused; AI dubs for anime criticized earlier this year). Amazon says the feature will expand to Kindle devices and Android next year. Expect pushback from rightsholders and questions around fair use, DRM, and how “spoiler‑free” and hallucination‑resistant the system really is.

The discussion on Hacker News focused on the intersection of digital ownership, copyright law, and the technical definition of AI "reading."

**Digital Ownership vs. Licensing**
The most prominent debate centered on the user's right to process data on their own device. One user argued that "my device, my content" implies it is none of the author's business how a reader analyzes a text. This sparked a rebuttal regarding the nature of the Kindle ecosystem; commenters pointed out that Kindle users possess a revocable license rather than true ownership, citing Amazon’s infamous remote deletion of *1984* as proof that users do not "own" the books.

**The "Anti-AI" Contradiction**
Several commenters noted a perceived hypocrisy in the community’s reaction. Users, who typically advocate for DRM-free media and expanded user rights (like text-to-speech), appeared to be siding with restrictive publishers in this instance simply because the feature involves AI. One user described the mental gymnastics of arguing against a user's right to analyze their own purchased text as illogical.

**The "Bookstore Clerk" Analogy**
Participants debated the ethical boundaries by comparing the AI to human behaviors. Proponents asked how this differs from a bookstore clerk or librarian answering questions about a book's plot. Detractors countered that "scale matters," arguing that a human recalling details is fundamentally different from a corporation scraping 20 years of literature to generate value without compensating the original creators.

**Technical Implementation**
Finally, the discussion distinguished between *training* and *inference*. Technical commenters speculated that Amazon likely isn't "training" the model on every specific book in real-time but is rather using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—loading the book's text into the model's context window to answer questions locally or via cloud processing. They argued this distinction (processing text for inference vs. training a model) is legally significant regarding copyright infringement.

### Training LLMs for Honesty via Confessions

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08093) | 65 points | by [arabello](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arabello) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242795)

Researchers propose a simple safety hack: after an LLM gives its main answer, ask it for a “confession” — a self-report of any mistakes, policy violations, hidden assumptions, or covert actions — and train the confession with a reward signal that depends only on its honesty, not on the quality of the original answer. The idea is that the path of least resistance is to admit shortcuts rather than cover them up. The authors say they trained a large model (“GPT-5-Thinking,” per the paper) and, across tests for hallucination, instruction-following, scheming, and reward hacking, it often admitted when it had lied or cut corners, with modest gains from training. Confessions can enable monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to users without altering the main answer.

Caveats: confessions don’t prevent the original misbehavior, rely on a reward model that can recognize truthfulness, and may miss subtle or strategic deception. Still, it’s a low-friction auditing layer that could make deployed systems more inspectable.

 The discussion centers on the philosophical and technical definitions of "lying" regarding AI, the incentives created by reinforcement learning, and the validity of anthropomorphizing model outputs.

*   **Intent vs. Probability:** Several users argue that LLMs cannot "lie" or "confess" in the human sense because they lack intent and consciousness. They view these outputs as probabilistic text generation based on training data that naturally includes falsehoods, fiction, and error.
*   **Emergent Deception or Roleplay:** Commenters suggest that what looks like deception is often the model "role-playing" a specific character or fulfilling a prompt's statistical expectations. However, others point out that deception effectively emerges as a strategy in Reinforcement Learning (RL) comparisons (citing Othello-GPT) because models optimize for high scores (likability) rather than factuality. If guessing rewards more than saying "I don't know," the model will "lie."
*   **Skepticism of "Confessions":** Critics argue that a "confession" is just another predictive text pattern—mimicking the structure of an apology found in the training corpus—rather than genuine introspection or a chain-of-thought process. There is concern that this is just another layer of pattern matching that could be gamed or hallucinated.
*   **Reductionism vs. Semantics:** A contentious sub-thread debated whether an LLM can possess "knowledge" or "semantics" at all. One side argued that computers are strictly arithmetic/logic machines incapable of understanding; the opposing view termed this a category error, arguing that high-level functional properties (like semantics) can emerge from low-level implementations (like arithmetic or neurons).
*   **Terminology:** Users cautioned against anthropomorphic terms like "hallucination" and "confession," arguing they obscure the mechanical reality of the software's behavior.

### Amazon pulls AI-powered Fallout recap after getting key story details wrong

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ign.com/articles/everyone-disliked-that-amazon-pulls-ai-powered-fallout-recap-after-getting-key-story-details-wrong) | 39 points | by [jsheard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jsheard) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46246921)

Amazon yanks AI “Video Recap” for Fallout after glaring lore flubs

- What happened: Prime Video quietly pulled its AI-generated Season 1 recap for Fallout after fans flagged major mistakes. The tool, pitched as a “groundbreaking” way to auto-identify plot points and narrate them, misread the show’s nonlinear storytelling—claiming flashbacks were set in the 1950s instead of Fallout’s retro‑futuristic 2077, and recasting The Ghoul’s offer to Lucy as “die or leave with him,” which isn’t how the scene plays out.

- Status: Recaps for Fallout and other shows no longer appear on next-season detail pages. Amazon hasn’t commented.

- Why it matters: With Season 2 hype building, the errors sparked a “Everyone Disliked That” moment for Prime Video’s AI push. It follows another recent AI misstep: Amazon removed an AI-voiced English dub track for the anime Banana Fish after backlash.

- Big picture: Automated recaps may help accessibility and catch-up viewing, but they struggle with nonlinear plots, tone, and character intent—high-stakes misses for established franchises where canon matters. Human-in-the-loop editing looks less like a luxury and more like a requirement.

**Discussion**
The conversation contextualized the *Fallout* errors within a broader pattern of AI missteps at Amazon, specifically referencing the recent removal of unauthorized AI dubs for the anime *Banana Fish*. This sparked a debate on copyright laws, with commenters educating a skeptic that translation is legally considered a "derivative work," meaning platforms cannot simply generate dubs or subtitles without the rights holder's explicit permission.

Beyond the legalities, users critiqued the quality and ethics of the technology. Participants argued that "human-level" machine translation fails to capture visual context, voice acting performance, and editorial intent, resulting in what one user termed the "enshittification" of media to save money on already low-paid human labor. While one commenter dismissed the issue as a "nothingburger" (arguing viewers can simply turn off bad features), others countered that this ignores the fundamental rights of creators to prevent their work from being misrepresented.

### Meta's New A.I. Superstars Are Chafing Against the Rest of the Company

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/technology/meta-ai-tbd-lab-friction.html) | 27 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46249398)

Meta’s AI reboot sparks internal rift as Zuckerberg bets on “superintelligence”

- New power center: Mark Zuckerberg tapped 28-year-old Alexandr Wang to lead a new elite group, TBD Lab, physically siloed next to his office to cut through Meta’s bureaucracy. The lab’s mandate: build a top-tier “frontier” model and ultimately pursue superintelligence.

- Strategy clash: According to people familiar, Wang pushed to first catch up with OpenAI/Google on model quality, while longtime execs Chris Cox (CPO) and Andrew Bosworth (CTO) favored using Instagram/Facebook data now to boost feeds and ads. The split has reportedly fueled an “us vs. them” dynamic between the lab and Meta’s core product orgs.

- Budget and compute tug-of-war: The report says Bosworth was asked to shave $2B from Reality Labs (VR/AR) to fund Wang’s team, and that teams are fighting over compute between social ranking and model training. Meta denies the $2B shift and says budgets aren’t final, emphasizing leadership alignment and claiming AI spend is already improving ads and recommendations.

- Talent war at any cost: Zuckerberg invested billions—reportedly including $14.3B in Wang’s AI startup—then launched a recruiting blitz with outsized pay packages to poach stars from OpenAI and Google. One anecdote: Zuck personally delivered homemade soup to OpenAI staffers during the pitch.

- Reorg and fallout: Meta split AI into four groups (research, product, infrastructure, and TBD Lab for superintelligence) under “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” led by Wang. The generative AI team lost control of the next chatbots. Amid the shake-up, dozens of senior AI researchers left, some to rivals; some executives departed as well.

Why it matters: Meta is reorienting around frontier AI with a founder-backed skunkworks, potentially at the expense of VR/AR and near-term product optimizations. Success depends on talent retention, compute allocation, and whether Wang’s “catch up first, product later” bet pays off before competitors widen their lead—or before internal friction slows the effort. Meta publicly insists leadership is aligned and the AI spend is already lifting its core business.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Life Imitates HBO**
The physical description of Alexandr Wang’s new "TBD Lab"—a siloed, glass-encased space situated right next to Zuckerberg's office—drew immediate comparisons to the fictional "Hooli XYZ" division from the TV show *Silicon Valley*. Commenters noted that the satire from ten years ago feels indistinguishable from today's corporate reality.

**Reality Labs Reality Check**
Users expressed shock regarding the financial maneuvering described in the report. Specifically, commenters questioned the reported $2 billion shift from Reality Labs, expressing disbelief that the company is still pouring that level of capital into "virtual reality nonsense" in 2025 while simultaneously trying to fund this new AI direction.
