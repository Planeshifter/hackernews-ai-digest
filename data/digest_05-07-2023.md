### Prolog for data science

#### [Submission URL](https://emiruz.com/post/2023-04-30-prolog-for-data-science/) | 164 points | by [usgroup](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=usgroup) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35855398)

In this article, the author explores the integration of Prolog as a key component in data science analysis, using symbolic reasoning to generate properties about the data under study. They include examples of piece-wise regression on time-series data using symbolic reasoning, demonstrating how to create symbols which represent facts about the data through the use of Python and Prolog. The author then shows how to merge overlapping segments to create bigger continuous linear spans, ultimately calculating an optimal piece-wise linear fitting to find the subset of non-overlapping spans that result in maximum coverage of the data.

The comments discuss various related topics. Some users mention the challenge of portability and incompatibility with previous versions in Datalog adoption. Others talk about the benefits and difficulties of working with Prolog and suggest resources for learning and using it. There are also discussions about data storytelling and decision-making based on data. Finally, one user shares a link to their project on SaaS metrics generator. However, there is an overall lack of engagement and comments on the topic.

### The Prime Video microservices to monolith story

#### [Submission URL](https://adrianco.medium.com/so-many-bad-takes-what-is-there-to-learn-from-the-prime-video-microservices-to-monolith-story-4bd0970423d4) | 472 points | by [mparnisari](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mparnisari) | [372 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35853148)

The Prime Video team's success with scaling up their audio/video monitoring service using a combination of serverless architecture and containers has sparked a debate over the usefulness of microservices versus a monolith approach. According to technology strategy advisor Adrian Cockcroft, the team's approach follows his own recommendation of building a serverless prototype first and then re-implementing it as a continuously running autoscaled container for sustained high traffic and low latency. Cockcroft also notes that microservices were over-sold as a solution to all problems and that there are times when a monolith or an existing service should be used instead. The Prime Video team's real-time user experience analytics engine for live video is a valuable addition to any video streaming service and can be accessed through Datazoom.io, a service whose chief architect and CTO are ex-Netflix colleagues of Cockcroft.

The benefits and drawbacks of microservices versus monoliths are discussed, with some users arguing that each approach has its merits depending on the project's specific needs. One user emphasizes the importance of selecting the right technology stack to minimize common errors during development and increase the chances of success.

### DEF CON to set thousands of hackers loose on LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/06/ai_hacking_defcon/) | 104 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35848573)

DEF CON's AI Village is set to host the largest red teaming exercise ever for any group of AI models, with hackers invited to find bugs and biases in large language models (LLMs). The event will feature LLMs built by AI companies like OpenAI and Google, and hackers will be tasked with finding flaws in these systems, including bias, hallucinations, and jailbreaks. The event, which will run from August 10-13 in Las Vegas, aims to promote the testing of a wide range of harms, and the hackers with the most points will win high-end Nvidia GPUs. Additionally, the event is supported by the White House Office of Science, Technology, and Policy; America's National Science Foundation's Computer and Information Science and Engineering Directorate; and the Congressional AI Caucus. 

One commenter expressed skepticism about the exercise and stated that it could lead to hackers planting exploits in open-source projects. Another commenter highlighted the challenge of debugging and ensuring security in non-deterministic computer programming, particularly in the context of machine learning and artificial intelligence. Another commenter discussed recent scientific progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning and the effort to make models more explainable and transparent. Other comments touched on the potential commercial applications of AI and concerns over data centers being located in China in the context of a potential conflict over Taiwan. Finally, some users joked about their inability to understand the articles and comments on the topic.

### AI tool designs mRNA vaccines that are more potent and stable

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01487-y) | 142 points | by [voisin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=voisin) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35847774)

Researchers at Baidu Research, the AI division of the Chinese search engine firm, have created an AI tool that could pave the way for mRNA-based vaccines that don't need refrigeration, potentially making them more widely available in resource-poor areas. The tool optimises mRNA sequences, allowing the genetic material to persist for longer and creating more stable mRNA. The enhanced stability offers improved protection against vaccine degradation, without the need for cold-chain equipment. The researchers tested the tool on COVID-19 and shingles vaccines in mice, leading to significant improvements in efficacy and shelf-life. The discussion surrounding the submission involved various topics, including the challenges of lattice parsing problems, the possible copyright and patent issues that RNA sequences and AI-generated works could face, and a debate on the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines.

### Google Calendar and Assistant Reminders Will Migrate to Google Tasks Soon

#### [Submission URL](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2023/02/calendar-and-assistant-reminders-to-tasks-migration.html) | 121 points | by [e2e4](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=e2e4) | [115 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35849243)

Google has announced that its Calendar and Assistant Reminders will soon be migrating to Google Tasks, according to a post on the Google Workspace Updates blog. The move will allow users to manage their to-do lists in a single place and will provide a more streamlined experience. Google Tasks' integration with other Workspace apps, such as Gmail and Drive, will also make it easier for users to stay organized and productive. The migration is expected to be completed by the end of 2023.

Most of the discussion on the Hacker News thread centers around the difference between calendar events and tasks, and how the consolidation of reminders and tasks in Google Tasks will simplify things. There are also suggestions for Google to improve the graphical representation of its product relationships and for the company to establish more user-friendly voice control systems similar to those seen in Star Trek. There is also a discussion about how Google is pushing its voice assistant technology, even when it may not be in the best interest of users.
