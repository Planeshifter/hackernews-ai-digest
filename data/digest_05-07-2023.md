### Vulkan Video Decoding

#### [Submission URL](https://wickedengine.net/2023/05/07/vulkan-video-decoding/) | 130 points | by [ibobev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ibobev) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35852774)

The Vulkan API now supports video decoding using the built-in fixed function video unit found in many GPUs. This feature allows for the creation of fast cross-platform video applications, freeing up the CPU from expensive decoding tasks. Rather than using existing libraries like FFMPEG, Vulkan's low-level approach supports interop with other graphics objects like buffers and textures. However, implementing Vulkan video functionality is complex and requires a deep understanding of the video format being used, such as H264 or H265. The compressed bitstream is placed in a GPU buffer and marked with VK_BUFFER_USAGE_VIDEO_DECODE_SRC_BIT_KHR to be usable in video decoding. Each unit must be separated correctly with the NAL start codes (0,0,1) or (0,0,0,1) byte sequence, and the video capabilities structure must be used to ensure correct alignment.

The Vulkan API now supports video decoding, freeing up CPU as the built-in GPU enables fast cross-platform video applications. However, it requires a deep understanding of video formats and precise bitstream separation. Commenters discuss alternatives to VAAPI, such as Video4Linux Memory-To-Memory API, DirectX, and FFMPEG. Moreover, they suggest that replacing VAAPI may depend on Intel's development, while some speculate about the possibility of crashless video decoding in modern web browsers with hardware decoders that tend to outperform software decoders in specific use cases. The discussion also touches on hardware decoders, AMD AV1 accelerators, and the challenges of programming for hardware interfaces.

In this post, the author showcases how Prolog can be used as a critical component in a data science analysis by demonstrating a widely applicable pattern that integrates analytic methods to generate properties about the data under study, which are then reasoned about using Prolog. The post includes examples of piece-wise regression on time series data via symbolic reasoning and discusses the general pattern of application. Overall, the author emphasizes the importance of making reasoning explicit in data science to reason more accurately and directly learn to reason better.

The post showcases how Prolog can be used for critical components in data science analysis. Prolog constructs symbolic reasoning using analytic methods, which allows users to reason directly and accurately, aiding in reasoning better. The discussion includes how Prolog could model flows related to economics and inducible logic programming, a field for learning/training based on Prolog syntax about logical propositions. It is also mentioned how SWI-prolog is attempting to make perfect integration points for the intelligent ways of processing multiple data sources, and there is a library for utilizing pairs with Prolog to solve linear regression problems. Lastly, there is a discussion about how reliance on data can cloud judgement, which could lead someone to pretend a decision is data-based when it is not, and how understanding one's interests and acknowledging them can lead to less bias.

#### [Submission URL](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/05/07/cyberpunk-2077s-path-tracing-update/) | 228 points | by [gautamcgoel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gautamcgoel) | [163 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35854772)

Raytracing, a technology used for creating advanced lighting effects in games, has been notoriously expensive and limited in most games due to the hardware requirements. However, recent technology demos have shown expanded raytracing effects. Cyberpunk 2077, a demanding AAA game, recently added a full path tracing mode, called "Overdrive", that utilizes raytracing. With path tracing enabled, the RX 6900 XT struggles along at 5.5 FPS, or 182 ms per frame. The use of raytracing kernels in Cyberpunk 2077's path tracing call demands a lot of vector registers, which RDNA 3, AMD's latest architecture, drastically improves upon.

Cyberpunk 2077 has a new feature called "Overdrive" that utilizes raytracing and has shown expanded raytracing effects in the game.

DLSS and ReSTIR were mentioned as alternative technologies that also make significant improvements to graphics quality.

### The Prime Video microservices to monolith story

#### [Submission URL](https://adrianco.medium.com/so-many-bad-takes-what-is-there-to-learn-from-the-prime-video-microservices-to-monolith-story-4bd0970423d4) | 479 points | by [mparnisari](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mparnisari) | [375 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35853148)

The Prime Video team recently published a story on scaling up their audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs by 90%, but many people missed the point and had bad takes on the matter. The team followed a Serverless First approach where they built a quick prototype using Step Functions and Lambda calls, then refactored it into a long running microservice that is horizontally scaled using ECS and invoked via a lambda function to handle sustained high traffic and improved efficiency. This is a microservice refactoring step, not a microservice to monolith transition, and is exactly what is recommended in Serverless First talks. The backlash against microservices arises from their over-sell as a solution for everything, and the complexity of Kubernetes comes at a cost that may not be necessary for small-scale enterprise workloads that are good candidates for a serverless first approach. Overall, it's important to understand when and how to effectively use microservices to build, manage, and operate systems. The real-time user experience analytics engine for live video that the team built is a valuable asset, and those running a video streaming service without real-time user experience monitoring may want to look into services like Datazoom.io.

The submission discusses the Prime Video team's approach to scaling up their audio/video monitoring service and reducing costs using a serverless first approach, which was misunderstood by many commenters. Some commenters criticized PHP and other specific technologies, while others argued for the importance of choosing the right technology stack to minimize common errors made by developers. The discussion also touched on the need to balance business needs and technical considerations during development, and the importance of avoiding rewrites and choosing stable frameworks.

### Belgium legalises ethical hacking

#### [Submission URL](https://www.law.kuleuven.be/citip/blog/belgium-legalises-ethical-hacking-a-threat-or-an-opportunity-for-cybersecurity/) | 435 points | by [jruohonen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jruohonen) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35847860)

Belgium has introduced a new whistleblower law that legalises "ethical hacking" under certain conditions even if the entity being hacked has not granted consent. The law sets out four conditions that ethical hackers must follow to be excused from criminal liability. One of the key conditions is that the hackers cannot aim to cause harm or receive illegitimate benefits. Hackers must also report any uncovered cybersecurity vulnerability to the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium and any organisations they investigated, the latest at the time they notify the CCB of a vulnerability.

Belgium has introduced a new whistleblower law called Klokkenluiderswet that legalizes "ethical hacking" under certain conditions. Ethical hackers cannot aim to cause harm or receive illegitimate benefits and must report uncovered cybersecurity vulnerabilities to the Centre for Cyber Security Belgium and any organizations they investigate. The discussion includes debates about whether companies that experience security incidents should be held liable, the difference between instances of reporting to a government agency versus public disclosure, and whether the law applies only to vulnerabilities located within Belgium. Some also express concern about the potential negative consequences of legalized hacking and the possible abuse of trust in the disclosed vulnerabilities.

### Qsort.h – Quicksort as a C macro (2019)

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/svpv/qsort) | 85 points | by [olitech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=olitech) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35846629)

A new implementation of Quicksort as a C macro has been shared by Alexey Tourbin on Hacker News. The implementation follows Robert Sedgewick's 1978 paper and works entirely on array indices while abstracting out access to the array elements with less and swap primitives provided by the caller. The distinctive feature of this implementation is its ability to sort a few dependent arrays not considered possible by other implementations. A benchmark has also been provided to evaluate the performance of a few implementations. While Michael Tokarev's Inline QSORT() implementation and the shared implementation were neck and neck, the STL implementation turned out to be the fastest.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/06/ai_hacking_defcon/) | 104 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35848573)

The DEF CON AI Village is holding what it describes as "the largest red teaming exercise ever for any group of AI models," inviting thousands of hackers to find bugs and biases in large language models built by OpenAI, Google and others. The event aims to address the diverse issues with these models, which remain unresolved due to a lack of people trained in red teaming and assessing them. Participants will have access to LLMs from various vendors and there will be a capture-the-flag-style point system to promote testing of "a wide range of harms." The event is supported by the White House Office of Science, Technology, and Policy.

There is general skepticism and concerns raised in the comments about the DEF CON AI Village's red teaming exercise for testing large language models. Some users criticize the logistics of the event, questioning the testing methods and the ethical considerations around using language models for potentially harmful purposes. Others expressed curiosity about the efficacy of red teaming for AI models, some believing that the approach is too deterministic and unsuitable for machine learning. Another commenter proposed that modifying machine learning models for explainability will benefit the discipline and is a higher priority than finding bugs and biases. Finally, some users express frustration with the low quality of mainstream news and the prevailing content for context excerpts in natural language processing.

### AI tool designs mRNA vaccines that are more potent and stable

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-01487-y) | 142 points | by [voisin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=voisin) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35847774)

Scientists at the California division of Baidu Research have developed an AI tool that optimises the gene sequences of mRNA vaccines, offering greater potency and stability. The tool utilises techniques from computational linguistics to design more intricate mRNA sequences than those used in current vaccines. This leads to more stable mRNA, which allows for more antigens to be produced by the protein-making machinery in individuals, and a rise in protective antibodies. The enhanced structural complexity also offers improved protection against vaccine degradation, eliminating the need for ultracold storage facilities. Sanofi has licensed the LinearDesign algorithm.
