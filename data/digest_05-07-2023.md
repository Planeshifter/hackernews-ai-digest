The Vulkan API has introduced a new feature that enables video decoding using the built-in fixed function video unit found in many GPUs. This makes it possible to create cross-platform video applications that are fast and efficient, freeing up the CPU from resource-intensive decoding tasks. The benefit of using a low level video API like Vulkan is that it allows for asynchronous processing on the GPU's video unit, leaving your main rendering unaffected. While there is a bit of a learning curve to implementing Vulkan video functionality, the resource requirements are minimal and the benefits are significant.

#### [Submission URL](https://adrianco.medium.com/so-many-bad-takes-what-is-there-to-learn-from-the-prime-video-microservices-to-monolith-story-4bd0970423d4) | 472 points | by [mparnisari](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mparnisari) | [372 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35853148)

The Prime Video team's success with scaling up their audio/video monitoring service using a combination of serverless architecture and containers has sparked a debate over the usefulness of microservices versus a monolith approach. According to technology strategy advisor Adrian Cockcroft, the team's approach follows his own recommendation of building a serverless prototype first and then re-implementing it as a continuously running autoscaled container for sustained high traffic and low latency. Cockcroft also notes that microservices were over-sold as a solution to all problems and that there are times when a monolith or an existing service should be used instead. The Prime Video team's real-time user experience analytics engine for live video is a valuable addition to any video streaming service and can be accessed through Datazoom.io, a service whose chief architect and CTO are ex-Netflix colleagues of Cockcroft.

The discussion revolves around the pros and cons of using the PHP language and the usefulness of microservices versus monoliths in software development. Some users argue that PHP has its weaknesses and is not the ideal language for building large-scale projects, while others believe that it can be an effective tool in the hands of experienced developers. The benefits and drawbacks of microservices versus monoliths are also discussed, with some users arguing that each approach has its merits depending on the project's specific needs. One user emphasizes the importance of selecting the right technology stack to minimize common errors during development and increase the chances of success.

#### [Submission URL](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/05/07/cyberpunk-2077s-path-tracing-update/) | 219 points | by [gautamcgoel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gautamcgoel) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35854772)

Hardware acceleration for raytracing has advanced significantly since Nvidia's Turing first introduced it, but its cost is still very expensive, leaving most games to stick to limited raytracing effects or avoid it altogether. However, Cyberpunk 2077 recently received a full path tracing mode called "Overdrive" in a recent patch, making it the most recent and demanding AAA game to include expanded raytracing effects. Enabling path tracing with a RX 6900 XT struggles at just 5.5 FPS with a dominated 162 ms raytracing call. Despite low occupancy, the game still achieves decent hardware utilization thanks to decent cache hitrates,  but there's room for improvement. RDNA 3 architecture by AMD has dramatically improved raytracing by making notable capacity improvements to the vector register file and caches for better occupancy and cache hitrates, as well as new traversal stack management instructions, and dual issue capability for faster non-raytracing instructions.
