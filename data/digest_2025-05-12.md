In a fascinating blend of neuroscience and AI innovation, a new development known as the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) aims to bridge the divide between the current state of AI and the incredible adaptability of biological brains. Developed by researchers from Sakana AI and universities in Tsukuba and Copenhagen, the CTM leverages the concept of neural synchronization—an essential feature in biological brains—to improve AI systems' flexibility and adaptability.

Most modern AI strategies prioritize computational efficiency by ignoring temporal dynamics, a choice that often limits their resemblance to the human mind's flexible nature. Unlike traditional neural networks that reduce neural computations to static values, the CTM focuses on the dynamic timing and synchronization of neurons, which are crucial for biological intelligence.

The researchers argue that temporal dynamics, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity and neural oscillations, are vital components that modern AI lacks for achieving human-like cognition. The CTM introduces a decoupled internal dimension and neuron-level models to process a history of incoming signals, moving away from static activations like ReLU.

In an interactive demonstration, the CTM showcases its abilities in solving mazes by utilizing neural synchronization as its core mechanism. The maze-solving task illustrates how the CTM deploys neural dynamics to interact with its environment, offering a glimpse into how these advanced models could revolutionize AI by embracing the complexities of temporal processing found in nature.

By placing emphasis on neuron timing and synchronization, the CTM not only challenges current practices but also sparks a conversation about the future direction of AI development—one that may ultimately bring us closer to understanding and replicating human-like reasoning.

### Avoiding AI is hard – but our freedom to opt out must be protected

#### [Submission URL](https://theconversation.com/avoiding-ai-is-hard-but-our-freedom-to-opt-out-must-be-protected-255873) | 243 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [139 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43958382)

In an age where artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly dictates the narratives of our daily lives, a pressing question arises that's often overlooked: What happens when we can't opt out of AI's influence? This query is front and center in an enlightening article by James Jin Kang from RMIT University Vietnam, published on The Conversation.

AI now orchestrates everything from job applications to healthcare decisions, adding a layer of complexity that often bypasses human judgment. In a world where an algorithm can reject your resume before a human even sees it, or where medical treatments are automatically selected by a machine, our autonomy faces unprecedented challenges. For many, AI’s encroachment feels akin to a sci-fi reality, one that edges uncomfortably close with each algorithm-driven decision.

Avoiding AI is no simple task. It underpins crucial systems—healthcare, transportation, finance—and extends its reach to social media, government services, and even the news we consume. Decisions made by AI in our daily lives are not only difficult to challenge but can require legal battles to overturn. The possibility of living entirely free from AI seems as elusive as choosing to abstain from electricity or the internet.

As AI systems gain ground, they bring with them biases and inequities. Automated processes in hiring or credit scoring can inadvertently favor certain demographics over others, creating social barriers and widening the gap between those integrated into the AI-driven world and those who lag behind. The societal impact is profound: opting out of AI might soon translate to opting out of essential modern life itself.

Echoing the timeless lesson of Goethe's "The Sorcerer’s Apprentice," AI holds the allure of powerful capabilities yet poses risks when unchecked. The moral of the tale—to avoid unleashing uncontrollable forces—resonates as we confront AI’s growing role in shaping our futures. The core concern is not just about technical safety but about protecting our freedom—to choose, to opt out, to maintain autonomy in the digital era.

To safeguard the right to a life free from AI's pervasive grip, systemic changes are imperative. Current AI governance frameworks emphasize fairness and accountability, but they typically ignore the fundamental right to disengage from AI without incurring societal penalties. Governments and businesses must craft policies that respect individuals' freedoms, ensuring no one is left behind in the digital transition.

Furthermore, digital literacy should be prioritized so individuals can understand and challenge technologies affecting their lives. Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial; individuals must have avenues to peer into these systems and hold them accountable.

Ultimately, as AI weaves deeper into the fabric of societal infrastructure—analogous to essential utilities like electricity—we must deliberate urgently on how to integrate it in a way that preserves human choice. Our collective future hinges on answering this pivotal question: As AI saturates more spaces in our lives, what do we potentially stand to lose?

The Hacker News discussion on AI's pervasive influence highlights several key themes and debates:

### 1. **AI in Hiring and Bias Concerns**  
   - Users critiqued AI-driven resume screening tools, noting that while automated systems (e.g., LLMs) mimic human judgment, they risk perpetuating biases. Companies may adopt these tools to reduce liability, but proving discriminatory intent or harm remains challenging.  
   - A subthread contrasted large corporations (e.g., Apple) using such tools with smaller-scale implementations, like in Omaha, where screening might be less invasive.  

### 2. **Accountability and Legal Challenges**  
   - The EU’s GDPR was cited as a framework requiring human review of AI decisions, though skeptics argued that human reviewers (e.g., HR staff) might lack expertise to override flawed AI judgments (e.g., confusing Java with JavaScript).  
   - Users debated whether companies can evade responsibility by blaming AI systems. Some emphasized that humans designing or deploying AI must be held accountable, referencing a 1979 IBM manual stating, “A computer should never be held accountable—it’s a tool for human management.”  

### 3. **Technical Realities of AI Systems**  
   - A detailed subthread explored spam filters as an example of AI making “final decisions.” Users discussed whether emails are silently discarded or flagged, technical nuances of email server logging, and the line between automation and human oversight.  

### 4. **AI vs. Human Decision-Making**  
   - While some argued AI systems inherit human biases (e.g., in insurance or loan approvals), others countered that humans are equally flawed. One user noted, “AI doesn’t change accountability—companies are still liable for bad outcomes, AI or not.”  

### 5. **Accessibility and Equity**  
   - Concerns were raised about marginalized groups facing disproportionate harm from AI errors (e.g., loan denials). Critics highlighted the high cost of litigation, which often makes challenging AI decisions inaccessible to lower-income individuals.  

### 6. **Skepticism Toward Regulation**  
   - While some called for stricter AI governance, others doubted enforcement efficacy, citing corporate lobbying and under-resourced regulatory agencies.  

### Key Takeaway  
The discussion reflects tension between recognizing AI’s potential benefits and grappling with its risks. Participants emphasized that systemic accountability—not just technical fixes—is critical to ensuring AI serves society equitably. As one user starkly put it, “Opting out of AI might soon mean opting out of modern life itself.”

### US Copyright Office found AI companies breach copyright. Its boss was fired

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/us_copyright_office_ai_copyright/) | 436 points | by [croes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=croes) | [374 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43961247)

In a surprising turn of events, the head of the US Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter, was reportedly fired a day after a draft report was published, suggesting that AI companies may be breaching copyright law. The report, part of an extensive investigation into the relationship between AI and copyright, stated that the use of copyrighted content by AI developers often exceeds the fair use doctrine. This conclusion could spell legal trouble for major tech companies, including Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft, all currently facing litigation over copyright issues. These companies have defended their actions, claiming adherence to fair use provisions, but the report argues otherwise, especially when AI models are used for commercial purposes in a way that competes with existing markets.

The timing of Perlmutter's dismissal has raised eyebrows, with some suggesting it was politically motivated to favor Elon Musk, who has been vocal about loosening intellectual property laws. Musk has recently been in the spotlight for supporting moves to eliminate IP protections and has ambitions to train AI models using vast data from his social media platform, X.

Other speculations point to a broader political agenda tied to a recent personnel change in the Library of Congress, which oversees the Copyright Office. This change was reportedly linked to disputes over diversity and the appropriateness of materials available in libraries for children—a policy direction heavily criticized by the Trump administration.

As the legal battles unfold, the tech industry and lawmakers are keenly watching how the copyright and AI crossroads will reshape future policies, potentially impacting not only how AI models are trained but also how copyright law is enforced in the digital age.
