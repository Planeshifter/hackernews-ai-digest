In a captivating tale of debugging adventure, a developer recounts their quest to unravel the mystery behind an astonishing 3,200% CPU utilization on their overloaded machine. Armed with Java 17's thread dumps featuring CPU time statistics, they embarked on a journey through a labyrinth of stack traces and buggy code to determine the source of their woe.

The root of the problem lay in an odd snippet of code within a function named `someFunction` in which an iteration loop over `unrelatedObjects` was erroneously performing operations solely on `relatedObject`. Despite reforming and testing this function, the issue persisted, suggesting deeper complexities at play.

Through sleuthing, the coder identified that a `TreeMap`, crucially unguarded by synchronization, was being accessed by multiple threads in parallel. This discovery led to an eye-opening experiment simulating high contention on the TreeMap. When subjected to multiple threads, the shared TreeMap sparked numerous exceptions and spiked CPU utilization—proof that the race conditions compromised not just data integrity but performance, leading to near-infinite computational loops.

Further digging and fascinating experiments revealed that in Java's Red-Black Tree implementation of TreeMap, such unchecked access could indeed form cycles, escalating the problem. Employing reflection, the developer exposed these cycles, granting a visceral insight into the havoc wreaked by unbounded concurrency.

This gripping debugging narrative not only highlights common pitfalls in multithreaded programming but also underscores the importance of protecting shared data structures with proper synchronization. For those intrigued by the full code exploration and reflection techniques, the author's GitHub repository holds the invaluable experiments, bringing more clarity to those navigating similar conundromes.

The Hacker News discussion explores the complexities of debugging concurrency issues, sparked by a developer’s discovery of a 3200% CPU spike caused by an unsynchronized Java `TreeMap`. Key themes and insights include:

1. **Concurrency Pitfalls**:  
   - The original issue stemmed from unsafe parallel access to a shared `TreeMap`, highlighting dangers of unsynchronized mutable state. Solutions like using `ConcurrentHashMap` or `Collections.synchronizedMap` were debated, though even these have caveats (e.g., thread safety at the collection level doesn’t protect individual operations or element integrity).  

2. **Immutable Data Structures**:  
   - Several users advocated for immutable data structures (as seen in Rust or functional programming) to eliminate shared-state concurrency problems. Functional approaches avoid side effects, simplifying multi-threaded logic.  

3. **Unexpected Bugs**:  
   - A typo placing `unrelatedObjects` into a `TreeMap` instead of `relatedObject` was noted as a potential root cause. However, fixes like "empty checks" were critiqued for not addressing thread safety.  

4. **Comparator/Comparable Risks**:  
   - Faulty `Comparator` implementations (e.g., violating *total order* contracts) can lead to infinite loops during sorting. Examples included Rust’s sorting algorithm breaking due to such issues and historical I/O Competition problems.  

5. **System Limitations**:  
   - Anecdotes about resource-constrained systems (e.g., old Sun servers with limited RAM) illustrated how concurrency bugs compound with I/O bottlenecks, leading to crashes or admin intervention.  

6. **Debugging Philosophy**:  
   - Users emphasized rigorous testing, transactional safeguards, and avoiding assumptions about thread safety. Tools like reflection (to inspect corrupted trees) and randomized testing (to detect comparator bugs) were championed.  

Ultimately, the discussion underscores the fragility of shared mutable state and the importance of synchronization, immutability, and defensive coding in multi-threaded environments.

In a bold move shaking up the AI world, Andrew Ng recently unveiled a new document extraction service that has created quite a stir. Hailed on social media platform X, the tool's real-world effectiveness was put to the test by the founders of Pulse, Sid and Ritvik, who used it on complex financial documents. Unfortunately, the results were less than stellar.

The service struggled significantly with extracting accurate data from intricate financial statements and nested tables. Alarming issues soon came to light: over 50% of outputs included hallucinated values, missing negative signs, and currency markers, not to mention entirely fabricated numbers. The processing time was also sluggish, exceeding 30 seconds per document, which spells trouble when dealing with thousands of pages.

A deeper dive revealed just how perilous these inaccuracies could be. In environments where financial decisions hinge on data integrity, this level of error poses a wrecking-ball threat to data pipelines. Given that even a 99% accuracy level might introduce 2,000 potential error points out of a hypothetical 1,000-page dataset, stakeholders demand top-notch precision—beyond 99.9%—for critical operations.

Pulse critiques hinge on the intrinsic weaknesses of using large language models (LLMs) for document extraction. The models' probabilistic nature means outputs vary from run to run, lacking the spatial acuity necessary for interpreting complex layouts. Processing speed also plays spoilsport, bottlenecking large-scale document tasks.

In contrast, Pulse has engineered a hybrid solution: blending proprietary table transformer models with tried-and-true computer vision algorithms, reserving LLMs for niche, controlled functions. Their approach promises almost-zero-error probability, immaculate data preservation, and nimble processing speeds—ideal for sectors like finance, law, and healthcare where precision can't be bargained.

For organizations grappling with mountains of mission-critical documents, Pulse offers an enticing alternative. Founders Sid and Ritvik invite interested parties to witness the difference firsthand by booking a demo. With successful demonstrations and a freshly announced $3.9M seed round funding, Pulse is set to redefine document processing standards.

### Crossing the uncanny valley of conversational voice

#### [Submission URL](https://www.sesame.com/research/crossing_the_uncanny_valley_of_voice#demo) | 64 points | by [nelwr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nelwr) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43200400)

Sesame Research Team is pushing the boundaries of digital voice technology with their recent advancements designed to bridge the "uncanny valley" of conversational voices. Their mission is to craft virtual companions capable of engaging in lifelike dialogue by honing in on four essential attributes: emotional intelligence, conversational dynamics, contextual awareness, and consistent personality. The team believes these elements are crucial for achieving "voice presence," a quality sought after to transform digital interactions into meaningful experiences that foster confidence and trust.

To demonstrate this progress, Sesame has unveiled a new demo featuring digital voices, Maya and Miles, optimized for friendliness and expressivity. These digital voices aim to go beyond traditional, monotonous voice assistants by adapting their tone and presence in real time, according to the context of the conversation.

Behind this leap forward is the Conversational Speech Model (CSM), which employs a sophisticated learning system using transformers. This model enhances the naturalness and coherence of speech by considering the history of the conversation, diving into more than just high-quality audio reproduction. Unlike older text-to-speech models, CSM frames speech generation as a multimodal task, creatively tackling the "one-to-many" problem, where understanding and selecting the appropriate variation of speech is crucial.

Key to this process is the integration of semantic and acoustic tokens, which respectively capture the linguistic essence and the finer acoustic details needed for high-fidelity voice synthesis. This two-step strategy, while challenging, allows for a structured synthesis approach but is currently hindered by limitations such as the sequential dependency in RVQ-based methods, impacting real-time application performance.

Overall, Sesame's work signifies an exciting shift towards more responsive and nuanced digital conversations, reflecting a significant step forward in the field of conversational voice technology. The team invites users to explore these advancements through their demo—ushering in a new era where AI companions can truly 'listen' and 'respond' just as attentively as a human counterpart would.
