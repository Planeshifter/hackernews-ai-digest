#### [Submission URL](https://rnikhil.com/2023/12/31/ai-cfr-solver-poker.html) | 69 points | by [whoami_nr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoami_nr) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38823240)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about solvers in Poker and how they work. The author, who used to play Poker professionally, explains that solvers are tools used to analyze and optimize gameplay. Unlike games like Chess and Go, Poker involves imperfect information as players don't know their opponents' cards. Solving a Poker game means finding a Nash Equilibrium strategy, also known as a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy, where neither player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy. However, while GTO ensures unexploitability, it may not maximize winnings. The best response strategy is one that maximally exploits an opponent's non-equilibrium play. Solvers determine the GTO play by using EV (Expected Value)-maximizing algorithms, where each agent represents a player and the goal is to maximize earnings. By iteratively playing against each other's strategies, the agents find the Nash equilibrium point. Regret is a measure of how well one could have done with an alternative action compared to their overall strategy. Minimizing regret is central to all GTO algorithms, with the most well-known being CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization). The author compares studying Poker to CFR, as they would play hands, review them with a coach, and aim to play more optimally in the future to reduce regret. The author also mentions the multi-armed bandit problem, which is a classic reinforcement learning problem and relates to Poker played in the partial information setting. The article concludes by discussing exploration vs. exploitation in decision making, using the example of picking travel destinations or restaurants.

The discussion on the submission includes various points and perspectives:

- One user mentions that CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization) solvers are slow and require a lot of RAM, but there is a smaller and abstract version of the game called Setback that doesn't need a perfect Nash equilibrium solution.
- Another user adds that commercially available solvers like CFR are not very strong and mentions Pluribus as an example of a precomputed solver that reduced state space and mapped hand combinations.
- A user shares their experience with using solvers like Monker Solver for multiple sports and states that they are fairly fast.
- The original poster mentions CFR in the context of transportation and logistics problems and gives other examples as well.
- A user comments that making money playing online poker by following computer-optimized strategies can be risky, but insights from optimized play are appreciated.
- The author responds, agreeing with the user's comment and adding that making money in online poker is more difficult now with increased scrutiny, and mentions GGPoker's detection system.
- Some users discuss the existence of detection systems for cheating in online poker and the challenges associated with implementing solvers.
- Another user comments on the theory of minimizing expected regret and its relevance to risk diversification and multiple perturbation groups in the modeling world.
- A user expresses surprise at the strength of open-source poker AIs and wonders if implementing CFR methods in poker is generally difficult.
- The author clarifies that there are CFR implementations and provides examples like Pluribus, but implementing them can be challenging due to replicating research. They also mention the cost of training and the possibility of bypassing KYC checks for multiple accounts.
- The user mentions training tools like GTO+ and PLOMastermind and a 2013 poker solver created by Oleg Ostroumov.
- Another user expresses surprise at the difference between the chess world and the poker world in terms of strong open-source engines and suggests that the attractiveness of making money might be a factor.
- The author explains that closed-source software in poker makes sense due to capital deployment and changing play patterns.
- A user adds that there have been recent examples in the chess world of closed-source commercial engines and open-source options.
  
Overall, the discussion covers various topics such as the limitations and challenges of poker solvers, commercial availability, cheating detection systems, and comparisons between the chess and poker worlds.

### Emacs-copilot: Large language model code completion for Emacs

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jart/emacs-copilot) | 361 points | by [yla92](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yla92) | [147 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38822164)

Introducing Emacs Copilot, a large language model code completion tool for Emacs. This tool allows you to do pair programming with a locally running language model that generates code completions within Emacs buffers. With just ~100 lines of LISP, Emacs can generate code completions similar to what Github Copilot and VSCode are famous for, but with superior quality and freedom. You can interrupt the language model at any time by hitting C-g, and it remembers your local editing history on a file-by-file basis. The tool is language-agnostic and determines the programming language based on the file extension. Check out the repository for more details and instructions on how to get started!

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of Emacs Copilot and the use of large language models (LLMs) in programming. 

- One comment mentions the increased productivity and quality of code achieved with LLMs compared to regular coding. They highlight the benefits of using LLMs for prototyping and debugging, and emphasize the importance of understanding and copying the generated code.

- Another comment praises the capabilities of Emacs in integrating LLMs, particularly mentioning the impressive Lisp support and the potential for further improvement.

- A user expresses their enthusiasm for the integration of LLMs in Emacs, comparing it to the beauty and longevity of the Duomo in Florence and suggesting that it will greatly enhance programming productivity.

- The topic of AI-based tools is raised, with one comment mentioning the potential acceleration of AI-based development tools in the future, and another user suggesting the usefulness of such tools for serious AI development.

- The efficiency of coding in modern front-end development frameworks like React is briefly discussed.

- A user reflects on GPT-generated commit messages and the challenges they present, such as difficulty in reviewing pull requests and the responsibility associated with using LLMs.

- There is a mention of the benefits of literate programming and its ability to provide a comprehensive and maintainable environment for coding.

- The discussion touches on specific technical aspects, including using Tramp for remote LLM integration, the ability to connect to LLMs over a LAN network, and the possibility of leveraging Llamafiles and the Llamafile API for more powerful AI development.

- A user shares their interest in self-hosted LLMs and expresses gratitude for the promotion of projects like Llamafiles. They also mention the distributed nature of StableDiffusion models and the challenges associated with loading and switching between different models.

- The value of local AI deployment and the security concerns associated with downloading executable files are discussed.

Overall, the discussion covers a range of topics, from the benefits and challenges of LLMs in programming to the technical aspects of integrating LLMs in Emacs and concerns about AI-based tools and their security implications.

### Chief Justice Roberts Says AI Will Transform How the Courts Work

The top story on Hacker News is a link to the Supreme Court's website, specifically their year-end report for 2023. One user highlights some interesting aspects of the report, including Justice David Brewer's reference to a typewriter fountain pen in 1905 and the potential for AI to revolutionize legal research. They also jokingly mention the idea of lawyers submitting briefs with nonexistent case citations. Another user comments on the use of LLM-like systems and AI in legal work, mentioning the exploration of specific legal training with GPT-4 and their skepticism about its usefulness. 

In another discussion, a user talks about testing different ways to explain very high-level concepts to GPT-4, using the example of Coke vs Pepsi. They note that LLMs (Language Model Models, possibly a typo for LMs) have incredibly diverse use cases and productivity boosts. 

A user makes the point that ChatGPT and LLMs generally model modern Supreme Court justices perfectly and can give desired conclusions that have structured and reasonable justifications. Another user clarifies that in today's context, justices rely on the gathering and analyzing of data, which is done by law clerks. 

The conversation then takes a humorous turn, with users discussing if one could summon the ghost of Thomas Jefferson to settle constitutional law matters. The discussion delves into the role of judges and their decisions being based on their beliefs, judgments, and philosophical reasoning. One user argues that judgments are not solely based on philosophical reasoning but also on the interpretation of the Constitution and the wisdom of the founding fathers. Another user counters by stating that judgments are not entirely objective and can vary based on personal interpretation. They highlight that the power of the Supreme Court comes from its judicial review authority, granted by the Constitution. 

Finally, a user flags a comment about the Bush vs. Gore case and mentions that it seems like a good point to mention when discussing the Supreme Court's decisions.
