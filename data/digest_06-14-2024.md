#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/NVIDIA/warp) | 456 points | by [jarmitage](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jarmitage) | [128 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40680737)

NVIDIA has unveiled "Warp," a Python framework tailored for high-performance simulation and graphics on GPUs. Warp takes ordinary Python functions and Just-In-Time compiles them into efficient kernel code compatible with both CPUs and CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPUs, allowing for swift execution. Primarily geared towards spatial computing, Warp boasts a comprehensive set of primitives that simplify the creation of programs for physics simulation, robotics, perception, and geometry processing. Notably, Warp kernels are differentiable, seamlessly integrating with machine learning pipelines through platforms like PyTorch and JAX.

To get started with Warp, it's recommended to install Python version 3.9 or newer. The framework supports x86-64 and ARMv8 CPUs on Windows, Linux, and macOS, with GPU functionality necessitating a CUDA-capable NVIDIA GPU and driver (at least GeForce GTX 9xx). Installation is straightforward via PyPI; users can simply run "pip install warp-lang" to acquire Warp. For added features and example support, executing "pip install warp-lang[extras]" is advised. 

Warp's existing binaries hosted on PyPI are configured with the CUDA 11.8 runtime, while versions built with CUDA 12.5 runtime are accessible on the GitHub Releases page. To install the latter, users can provide the URL of the appropriate wheel file while running the installation command. Developers keen on building the library themselves can refer to the documentation for specific tools and steps required. For those keen on exploring the capabilities of Warp, the framework's examples directory contains scripts showcasing various simulation methods using the Warp API. With examples generating USD files encompassing time-sampled animations, users are encouraged to install the necessary packages like usd-core, matplotlib, and pyglet. Running examples is simplified through command-line execution, providing a hands-on experience with implementing different simulation techniques.

In essence, NVIDIA's "Warp" presents a promising avenue for developers looking to harness the power of GPUs for enhanced performance in simulation and graphics tasks, poised to streamline workflows and expand possibilities in spatial computing and machine learning integrations.
