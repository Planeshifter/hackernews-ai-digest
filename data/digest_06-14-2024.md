### AIM Jacking on Macintosh Systems (2001)

#### [Submission URL](http://mazur-archives.s3.amazonaws.com/aol-files/articles/names_hypah_aimexploit.html) | 9 points | by [rob](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rob) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40682232)

In a classic case of tech exploitation, a user named Hypah has been able to jack AOL Instant Messenger screen names on Macintosh systems by manipulating the language code atom. Even though the PC exploit was patched by AOL, the Macintosh system remained vulnerable. Hypah took matters into his own hands and started snatching up coveted three-character AIM names, resulting in 4751 stolen names in just two days. But fear not, all these names are stuck in limbo as Hypah canceled the registration process for each, leaving them with random passwords and unusable accounts. It's a wild world of online mischief out there!

The discussion revolves around the topic of jacking three-letter screen names that were popular back in 2001 and how they have disappeared over time. One user mentions that people no longer use short screen names and now prefer handles that include more characters, with some desired names exceeding 7 characters in length. Remembering people's short names to crack their passwords is considered a mind-blowing way to access large password lists. Another user shares their experience in cracking the short character usernames, achieving a difficult quest and contacting the original owner of the screen name, which was eventually relinquished. Lastly, a user simply comments with "#770," possibly indicating their brief reaction or acknowledgment of the content.
