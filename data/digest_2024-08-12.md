### Senate: Kroger's new AI pricing scheme is 'corporate greed out of control'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.rawstory.com/kroger-pricing-strategy/) | 39 points | by [ajdude](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ajdude) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41224070)

Kroger's new AI-driven dynamic pricing model has sparked criticism from lawmakers, notably Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bob Casey, who branded it as a manifestation of "corporate greed." The grocery giant's partnership with AI company IntelligenceNode and Microsoft allows for tailored pricing strategies based on customer data, raising privacy concerns and fears of increased inequality. Critics argue that this approach could lead to customers being charged differently based on factors like age and gender, thus exacerbating existing financial pressures for families already struggling with high grocery costs. As Kroger expands this pricing system, the Senators have called for transparency and accountability regarding its implementation. 

The discussion on Hacker News regarding Kroger's AI-driven dynamic pricing model reveals a mix of concerns and opinions from users. Some commenters view the use of demographic screening for pricing as a worrying trend, equating it to a form of exploitation, particularly affecting vulnerable populations. A user noted that such practices could worsen existing inequalities by potentially increasing prices for certain groups, like families facing economic hardship.

Others compared this approach to common marketing strategies that have been normalized in society, such as discounts based on student status or gender-specific promotions. This led to discussions about whether dynamic pricing based on individual characteristics is inherently unjust or simply a market strategy. There were also mentions of transparency and legality, with some users questioning whether this model crosses ethical lines.

Finally, the conversation touched on broader societal issues, including rising costs of basic necessities and corporate practices, with references to historical narratives about wealth and class disparity. The consensus seemed to lean towards advocating for more accountability and awareness regarding how these pricing models could impact consumer fairness and access to essential goods.
