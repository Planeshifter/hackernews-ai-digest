The dangers of open-source AI systems are highlighted in a guest post on IEEE Spectrum. While closed-source AI applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT have secure software held by the maker, powerful unsecured AI systems are being rapidly released without regulations. Companies like Meta, Stability AI, Hugging Face, Mistral, EleutherAI, and the Technology Innovation Institute are releasing unsecured AI systems, which could generate misleading or toxic content. While the open-source movement is important for democratizing access to AI, there is currently a lack of control over the risks posed by unsecured AI. Regulation is needed to address these concerns.

The comments on this submission cover various aspects of the dangers and implications of open-source AI systems. Some users express concerns about closed-source AI applications, stating that they may also pose risks and that public safety requires regulation. Others argue that researchers working behind closed doors can create dangerous things, and the risks are not limited to open-source AI. 

Some comments discuss the potential for misuse of open-source AI models, such as using them to generate misleading or toxic content. There is a debate about whether open-source AI systems should be called "unsecured" or "unsecured AI models." Some users argue that replacing the term "AI" with "computer" in the discussion provides better insights into how the human mind works and the potential dangers.

There are also discussions about the role of regulation and the need for transparency in open-source AI. Some users argue that the risks associated with AI can be mitigated by commercial service providers offering well-secured systems. Others express skepticism about the article and the motives behind it, suggesting that it may be misleading or propaganda.

Overall, the comments reflect a range of opinions on the dangers and regulation of open-source AI systems, with some users emphasizing the importance of responsible development and others questioning the level of risk and potential for misuse.

### Your pacemaker should be running open source software

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/01/12/column/) | 18 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38984030)

In a recent article by Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols, the author highlights the issue of proprietary software in medical devices, specifically implantable medical devices like pacemakers, defibrillators, and insulin pumps. Vaughan-Nichols tells the story of Karen Sandler, the Executive Director of the Software Freedom Conservancy, who faced a life-or-death situation when she couldn't access data from her pacemaker because it ran on proprietary software. This incident raises concerns about the lack of transparency and security in medical devices, as proprietary software is a black box that only the manufacturer has control over. Vaughan-Nichols emphasizes that all software has bugs and vulnerabilities, and open-source software tends to be safer and more reliable over time. He also references previous cases where medical devices were found to have security vulnerabilities and were subject to recall. The author's main point is that relying on proprietary software in medical devices puts patients at risk and highlights the need for greater transparency and security in the industry.

The discussion on this submission primarily focuses on the need for third-party verification and the importance of open-source software in ensuring the safety and reliability of medical devices. Some users argue that running certified and audited software by competent third-party experts is essential for identifying and mitigating safety defects. They also highlight that open-source software tends to have a higher quality level and allows for additional quality assurance measures. 

Others discuss the challenges of relying on closed-source software in medical devices, citing cases where certified software was replaced with uncertified versions, potentially compromising patient safety. They argue that only certified source code is constantly validated in production and that open-source software is a sufficient alternative for safety-critical deployments. 

There is also a discussion on the liability of component providers and the importance of transparency in the medical field. Some users emphasize the need for full chemical makeup and formulation information in medical products, while others highlight the importance of third-party validation in ensuring the efficacy and safety of medications. 

The topic of regulation and testing by centralized authorities like the FDA is also mentioned, with suggestions that decentralization of verification processes could improve safety and efficiency.

Overall, the discussion revolves around the significance of open-source software, the need for third-party verification, and the challenges related to closed-source and proprietary software in the medical device industry.
