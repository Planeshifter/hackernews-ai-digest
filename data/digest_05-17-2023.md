#### [Submission URL](https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2023/05/depression-reverse-brain-signals.html) | 304 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [200 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35975353)

Stanford Medicine researchers have discovered how magnetic stimulation reverses the abnormal flow of neural activity in major depressive disorder patients. The technique changes the direction of the brain signals to dissipate depression and restore the normal timing of activity to ease symptoms. Researchers also discovered that the backward streams of neural activity between key areas of the brain could serve as a biomarker to diagnose depression. The Stanford neuromodulation therapy, which modifies brain activity related to depression, uses magnetic pulses to stimulate the brain and can accelerate remission for treatment-resistant depression in a shorter time than traditional treatments.
