#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/nickm980/smallville) | 102 points | by [nm980](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nm980) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35980223)

Smallville is a project that aims to create generative agent simulations for RPG games or research. Generative agents are virtual characters that can learn and adapt to their environment, making non-playable characters more realistic and dynamic. Smallville uses LLM models such as ChatGPT or StableLM to enable agents to observe their surroundings, store memories, and react to state changes in the game world. The project provides a Java server and a JavaScript SDK for creating generative agents, which can be connected to the server and run in a game. Examples and documentation are available on npm to help developers get started.

The comments discuss the challenges of using large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or StableLM, which require significant computational and memory resources. Some commenters express interest in the project and suggest improvements, such as adding prompt-driven changing or refactoring, while others discuss their own experiences and projects related to generative agents and AI in gaming.

The tool, which is popular among the 7 million people who use it for machine learning, data analysis and education, will use Google's Codey models, a family of code models fine-tuned on a dataset of high-quality, permissively licensed code from external sources. The first Codey features in Colab will focus on code generation, with a "Generate" button allowing users to input text prompts, while paid users will receive autocomplete suggestions.

Discussions around this new feature include comments expressing excitement about the update and other users sharing how they have found VS-cd running notebooks helpful. Another discussion focuses on a program that allows programmers to write code just by typing out plain English sentences. Some commenters discuss difficulties with requirements gathering and business analysis in software development.

### Conditional CSS with:has and:nth-last-child

#### [Submission URL](https://ishadeed.com/article/conditional-css-has-nth-last-child/) | 115 points | by [shadeed](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shadeed) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35976891)

In a recent blog post, Ahmad Shadeed discusses the power of combining the CSS :nth-last-child and :has selectors to create conditional component and layout states. While :nth-last-child allows the counting of child elements in CSS, :has can be used to check if a parent element has at least a specific number of items and style it accordingly. Shadeed demonstrates the potential of this technique through various examples, including a changing grid based on the number of items, a dynamic header layout, a dynamic news section, and more. This approach opens up endless possibilities for creating more flexible and adaptive designs with CSS.

Pandas AI is a new Python library that uses generative artificial intelligence capabilities to turn dataframes into conversationalists. It is designed to enhance, rather than replace, the already beloved Pandas library. With Pandas AI, users can create dataframes that write their own reports, analyze complex data and provide easy-to-understand summaries. This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to use Pandas AI. While the library offers extensive possibilities, it is important to remember that it involves OpenAI pricing and passing the entire dataframe with each question, which may not be ideal for handling large datasets.

Some users express skepticism about the library, suggesting it is trying to simply capitalize on the AI hype without offering significant improvements. Others highlight the potential benefits of AI-assisted data analysis and suggest alternative libraries like Polars. Overall, there is both interest and caution around the use of AI in the context of data analysis.
