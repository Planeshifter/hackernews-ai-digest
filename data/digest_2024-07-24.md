### AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y) | 248 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [175 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41058194)

A recent study delves into an intriguing phenomenon called "model collapse," affecting generative AI models like GPT when they are trained on data generated by their predecessors. As we enter an era where large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate online content, researchers warn that using this model-generated text indiscriminately can lead to irreversible defects in subsequent AI models. 

The study highlights a degenerative process whereby future models, trained on polluted datasets mostly consisting of prior AI outputs, begin to lose touch with genuine human-generated content. This degeneration occurs in two phases: initially, these models start to forget details about the "tails" of data distributions, leading to a simplified and less varied understanding of text. Over time, this can culminate in a severe divergence from the original data, significantly impairing the output quality.

The implications are substantial; it suggests that as LLMs disseminate content more widely, the importance of preserving original, human-generated data becomes crucial. Researchers point out that without this genuine source, the future quality of AI-generated content may decline dramatically, reducing the effectiveness of these models in understanding and producing complex, high-quality human language. Thus, as AI technologies evolve, preserving authentic human interactions could be key to maintaining the richness and accuracy of generative models in the digital age.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the phenomenon of "model collapse" in generative AI, specifically how synthetic datasets generated by AI can adversely affect future AI models. Users debated the implications of training AI on content primarily produced by other AIs, noting concerns that this could lead to a degradation of the quality and diversity of generated content.

Several comments highlight the challenges of distinguishing between human-generated and AI-generated content, with some suggesting that over-reliance on the latter could skew the AI's understanding of language. The conversation also pointed out how models that mostly learn from popular or heavily weighted web pages might not capture the full spectrum of human language, leading to a narrow, less authentic output.

Some users referenced the importance of maintaining high-quality human-generated datasets to counteract the potential negative effects of model collapse. Others highlighted the need for more robust filtering mechanisms in AI training to ensure that the models do not inadvertently propagate low-quality or misleading content.

There was also a discussion about the ethical implications of using AI in writing and content creation, where concerns were raised about trust in AI-generated material and the role of writers. Many participants emphasized the need for ongoing research and critical examination of how these models are developed and trained to mitigate risks associated with dependence on synthetic data.
