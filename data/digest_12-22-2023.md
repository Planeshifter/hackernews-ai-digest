### Direct initialization of transformers using larger pretrained ones

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09299) | 44 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38737262)

Researchers at Stanford University have developed a technique called weight subcloning, which allows for the direct initialization of smaller transformer models using weights from larger pretrained models. Training large transformers from scratch can be time-consuming and computationally demanding, so transfer learning is commonly used to initialize models with weights from pretrained models. However, if a pretrained model of the required size is not available, this approach becomes challenging. Weight subcloning addresses this problem by performing an operation on the pretrained model to obtain an initialized scaled-down model. This technique improves training speed and convergence for vision transformers in image classification and language models designed for next token prediction. The researchers achieved up to 4x faster training using weight subcloning compared to random initialization.

In a recent blog post, the author reflects on the focus of memory safety in programming languages, particularly in the case of Rust. They argue that the distinction between memory safe languages (MSLs) and non-memory safe languages is not sufficient to capture the broader concept of safety in programming. While memory safety is important, it is not the only aspect to consider.

The author acknowledges that Rust's marketing has heavily emphasized memory safety, which has its merits. However, they wonder if it would have been better to highlight a more general concept of safety. They also express curiosity about the future of C++ successor languages in light of upcoming legislation that could mandate the use of MSLs in government procurement.

The author then addresses a question raised on Hacker News about Python's inclusion in the category of "memory safe" languages. They explain that while calling C from Python can introduce potential problems, the fault lies with the C code, not Python itself. Pure Python, they argue, is indeed memory safe. However, they admit that existing definitions of memory safety can be vague and unsatisfying.

The blog post also references a document published by the Five Eyes, which emphasizes the importance of memory safety in programming languages. It outlines memory safe programming languages (MSLs) that can eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities and mentions C and C++ as examples of memory unsafe languages. The document also recognizes that hybrid programming models, combining safe and unsafe languages, will be used for the foreseeable future.

In conclusion, the author raises thought-provoking questions about the definition and scope of memory safety in programming languages, highlighting the need to consider safety beyond just memory. They also mention the potential challenges and limitations in adopting MSLs in real-world scenarios.

One user starts by mentioning that Swift and C++ have an interesting interoperability story, with Swift's compiler including Clang to support C++. They express surprise that the blog post didn't discuss the similarities between Swift and Rust, which they believe to be potential successors to C++.

Another user responds that Rust's focus on memory safety does not solve all the problems, as it still allows for potentially unsafe features like FFI and conditional panics. They argue that building safe abstractions in Rust requires taking abstraction layers seriously. They also mention their struggle with building quality abstractions in Swift and Java when it comes to FFI.

A different user brings up a relevant document published by the Five Eyes, which emphasizes the importance of memory safety in programming languages. They mention that the document lists C#, Java, Ruby, Rust, and Swift as examples of memory-safe languages. They later add that they found a European Union document mentioning Rust as well.

Another user highlights the importance of governments improving memory safety in technology, sharing anecdotes about their experience with government projects that encountered issues due to low-quality, insecure software. They express enthusiasm for Rust and its potential impact on government projects, but caution that the results may not be immediate.

The discussion then veers off into a clarification about Rust and the intention behind the blog post. One user mentions that they interpreted the post as suggesting Rust as a replacement for C++ in government projects, while another user expresses confusion and states that they believe the post doesn't make that claim.

Finally, a user flags the discussion as interesting and comments that it presents different points and raises thought-provoking questions.
