BrainKernel: a snarky, LLM-powered process manager that “judges” what to kill

What it is: A Python/Textual TUI that uses an LLM to analyze running processes by context (parentage, disk I/O, behavior history) and decide whether they’re harmless (e.g., a browser on a video call) or bloatware worth killing. It roasts offenders before acting and logs them in a “Hall of Shame.”

What’s new in v3.4 “The Silent Guardian”:
- Diplomatic Immunity: Hardcoded protection for browsers, chat apps, IDEs; it may scold them but won’t kill them.
- Stealth Mode: Tuned to work smoothly with Groq’s cloud API.
- <1% CPU overhead: “Delta Caching” to monitor 300+ processes without lag.

Features:
- Cloud or local LLM: Groq (free/fast) or Ollama.
- Focus Mode: Set a “focus app” (e.g., VS Code); background distractions >5% CPU get suspended.
- Quick controls: Protect a PID, ban a process name for auto-kill, force a roast, resume all, view shame log.
- Safety rails: PID creation-time checks to avoid recycled-PID mishaps, debouncing decisions for 5 minutes, protected app categories.

Why it’s interesting: It’s a playful but thought-provoking experiment in LLM-driven OS heuristics—less “replacing the scheduler” and more a context-aware, user-space task manager with attitude.

Getting started:
- pip install psutil textual
- python main.py
- Add a Groq API key in-app (or point to Ollama)

**BrainKernel: A snarky, LLM-powered process manager that “judges” what to kill**
This Python TUI uses an LLM (via Groq or locally with Ollama) to analyze process metadata—like parentage and disk I/O—to decide if apps are harmless tools or "bloatware" worth killing. It features a "Hall of Shame" for roasted processes and a "Focus Mode" that suspends distractions consuming too much CPU.

**Discussion:**
*   **The "Cursed" Efficiency:** The author frames the project as an experiment in "cursed" computing, acknowledging the irony of burning datacenter power (or local GPU watts) just to optimize a laptop. Commenters joked about the trade-off of "burning a coal plant to decide to close Discord," which the author dubbed "peak 2025 energy."
*   **Technical Semantics:** Users pointed out that this doesn't actually replace the Windows (NTOS) scheduler in the kernel (Ring 0). The author clarified that it acts as a "High-Level Governor" in userspace that overrides the OS's fairness logic by suspending processes entirely.
*   **Neurotic Management:** One commenter noted the tool essentially outsources the "neurotic" habit of staring at task managers to kill resource hogs (like Dropbox), describing it not as a scheduler, but as a "scheduler's manager."
