#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/drone-quadrotor) | 164 points | by [Brajeshwar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar) | [113 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39315440)

Researchers at New York University's Agile Robotics and Perception Lab, in collaboration with the Technology Innovation Institute (TII), have developed a system that can train a drone to fly in just 18 seconds using simulation. The researchers used techniques like reinforcement learning and curriculum-based training to streamline the process of teaching drones to fly autonomously. The system is able to train a drone to perform stable and controllable flight in just 18 seconds on a MacBook Pro. This breakthrough could simplify the process of getting drones to fly autonomously and enable faster deployment of autonomous drone applications.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to the ability of animals, specifically baby birds and humans, to learn to fly or walk shortly after birth. Some commenters point out that it is inherent in their hardware and behavior to learn these skills, while others suggest that the learning process is more complex and involves genetic programming and reflexes. The conversation also touches on the difficulties of human childbirth and the long development process compared to other animals. There is a discussion about the trauma of childbirth and the assumption that it is always traumatic, with differing opinions on the matter. The conversation further explores the relationship between brain and body size in different species. Lastly, there is mention of the hardware and muscular differences between baby birds and humans and the impacts on their respective development processes.

### Sam Altman seeking trillions for AI chip fabrication from UAE, others

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/02/report-sam-altman-seeking-trillions-for-ai-chip-fabrication-from-uae-others/) | 49 points | by [whiteboardr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whiteboardr) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39318848)

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is reportedly seeking to raise $5 trillion to $7 trillion for AI chip manufacturing. This funding aims to address the shortage of graphic processing units (GPUs) needed for training and running large language models. Altman is pitching a partnership between OpenAI, investors, chip makers, and power providers to build chip foundries, with OpenAI committing to be a significant customer. Altman has met with potential investors worldwide, including the United Arab Emirates and representatives from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC). The fundraising goal reflects the need to expand global capacity for semiconductor manufacturing to meet the growing demand for AI-specific chips. However, the involvement of the UAE raises potential geopolitical concerns about foreign control over the tech industry. The US government has been cautious about allowing foreign control of microchip supply due to their importance to the digital economy and national security. Altman's funding goal is significantly higher than the $5 billion investment recently announced by the White House to advance US-made semiconductor technologies. It remains unclear whether Altman has secured any commitments for his fundraising goal.

Discussion:

- There is skepticism about the feasibility of raising $5 to $7 trillion for AI chip manufacturing, with some questioning the practicality of such a large fundraising goal.
- Comparisons are made to the market capitalization of companies like TSMC ($500 billion), ASML ($350 billion), and NVIDIA ($1.7 trillion).
- Concerns are raised about the potential geopolitical implications of involving the United Arab Emirates in the project, given the importance of microchips to the digital economy and national security.
- It is noted that Apple and Microsoft, with market valuations of $3 trillion, have not ventured into semiconductor manufacturing themselves.
- There is discussion about the financials and profitability of the chip manufacturing industry.
- Some commenters draw comparisons between Sam Altman and Elon Musk, highlighting their similar approaches to business and funding.
- There is debate about Altman's track record and competency as a CEO, with some questioning his technical understanding and business acumen.
- The discussion also touches on the role of personal charisma and attention-grabbing tactics in attracting funding and public support.
- There are contrasting opinions on whether Altman's ambitious funding goal is realistic or if it is a marketing ploy.
- The potential impact of the project on the microchip industry and the broader economy is discussed.
- Some commenters express caution about drawing parallels between Altman and other successful entrepreneurs, emphasizing the need to consider individual achievements and track records when evaluating business ventures.
- There is a side conversation about the general perception of Silicon Valley and the criticisms directed towards its leaders.
- The involvement of the UAE in the project is seen as significant and potentially influential due to their substantial investments in the tech industry.
- Some commenters express doubt about Altman's ability to deliver on his fundraising goal, and discuss broader issues related to technology and investment.

### AI cannot be used to deny health care coverage, feds clarify to insurers

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/02/ai-cannot-be-used-to-deny-health-care-coverage-feds-clarify-to-insurers/) | 114 points | by [WhyUVoteGarbage](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=WhyUVoteGarbage) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39309534)

The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has clarified that health insurance companies cannot use algorithms or artificial intelligence (AI) to determine care or deny coverage to members on Medicare Advantage plans. This clarification comes in response to lawsuits filed by patients claiming that UnitedHealth and Humana have been using a flawed AI-powered tool to deny care to elderly patients on Medicare Advantage plans. The tool, called nH Predict, allegedly produces inaccurate estimates for how long a patient will need post-acute care in facilities like nursing homes. The CMS memo states that coverage decisions must be based on the individual patient's circumstances and should not rely solely on algorithmic predictions. The CMS also warned insurers to ensure that any AI tools or algorithms used do not perpetuate bias or discrimination. Failure to comply with the CMS guidelines can result in penalties and sanctions for insurers.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to the use of AI in healthcare and the flaws in the current healthcare system. 
Some users express concerns about the regulations surrounding AI in healthcare, arguing that regulations often draw arbitrary lines and fail to fully understand the outcomes of algorithmic predictions. They point out that statistical models can be interpreted, while AI models are often treated as black boxes. Others disagree and explain that deterministic processes can be built into AI models, and decisions should be interpreted based on the model's parameters and tweaked if needed.
There is also a discussion about the blame for denying coverage to patients. One user suggests blaming the AI systems, while another argues that the blame should be placed on the individuals responsible for implementing the AI systems.
The conversation also touches on the flaws of the healthcare system itself, with a user criticizing the system's capitalist nature and another pointing out the issue of misaligned motivations between insurance companies, doctors, and patients.
The discussion highlights the complexity and challenges associated with AI in healthcare, including the need to address biases and the limitations of current regulatory approaches. Users express different perspectives on the role of AI in decision-making and the overall functioning of the healthcare system.
