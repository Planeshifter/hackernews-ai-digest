#### [Submission URL](https://waymo.com/blog/#short-all-systems-go-at-sfo-waymo-has-received-our-pilot-permit) | 691 points | by [ChrisArchitect](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ChrisArchitect) | [714 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45264562)

Waymo teams up with Lyft to bring fully driverless rides to Nashville in 2026, as airport and city rollouts accelerate

- What’s new: Waymo says riders in Nashville will be able to hail fully autonomous rides starting in 2026—first via the Waymo app, with Lyft integration to follow. It’s the first announced U.S. market where Waymo will be available inside the Lyft app at scale.
- Expansion drumbeat: The company also flagged Dallas for a 2026 launch; Denver service groundwork begins this fall; and it’s opening up in the broader Seattle metro.
- Airports heat up: Waymo received a pilot permit to operate commercially at SFO (starting with pickups/dropoffs at the Kiss & Fly area) and got authorization for fully autonomous service at San José Mineta (SJC) terminals, with commercial service targeted for later this year. This builds on its existing Phoenix Sky Harbor operations.
- Scale claims: Waymo touts “hundreds of thousands” of weekly fully autonomous trips and 100M+ public road miles, saying it’s entering a faster commercial expansion phase.
- Tech notes: Denver will see a mixed fleet—Jaguar I-PACE with the 5th‑gen Driver and Zeekr RT vehicles with the 6th‑gen Driver—designed to sustain autonomous ops in harsher climates, reflecting years of winter-weather training.
- Why it matters: The Lyft partnership extends Waymo’s distribution beyond its own app; airport service unlocks high-frequency, high-trust use cases; and multi-city timelines suggest Waymo is pushing hard to convert pilot density into mainstream availability.
- What to watch: Regulatory pace city-by-city, size of geofences, wait times and pricing, the Lyft rollout timing, and how quickly Waymo can expand curb access at airports from satellite zones to terminal curbs.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion: Autonomous Driving vs. Flying**

The discussion pivots from Waymo’s autonomous vehicle expansion to a debate on why fully autonomous *passenger planes* lag behind self-driving cars, despite aviation’s reliance on advanced autopilot systems. Key points:

1. **Structured vs. Unstructured Environments**  
   - Flying is seen as more predictable (e.g., regulated air corridors, ILS/GPS guidance) versus chaotic road environments with pedestrians, cyclists, and erratic drivers.  
   - **Autopilots** excel in cruise control (low demand) but struggle with complex tasks like takeoff, landing (especially in crosswinds), and taxiing. Sensors in planes (altitude, speed, pitch) are simpler than the multi-dimensional data required for road navigation (cameras, lidar, real-time traffic analysis).

2. **Human Pilots and Redundancy**  
   - Human pilots remain critical for edge cases (e.g., mechanical failures, emergency landings like the "Miracle on the Hudson"). While automation handles routine tasks, human oversight is still mandated.  
   - A subthread cites a survey where 93% of pilots admitted to napping mid-flight, sparking debate about human reliability versus algorithmic precision.  

3. **Regulatory and Economic Barriers**  
   - Aviation regulations prioritize extreme safety, making certification for fully autonomous systems politically and technically fraught. Costs for redundancy (e.g., triple-redundant systems) and infrastructure (ILS maintenance) are high.  
   - Small cargo planes (e.g., Cessnas) are deemed more likely candidates for early automation due to lower stakes and crew cost savings, unlike passenger jets.

4. **Drones as a Precedent**  
   - Remote-controlled military drones (e.g., MQ-1 Predator) are noted, but scaling to passenger planes faces hurdles like latency, communication reliability, and public trust.  
   - Taxiing automation, via ground control systems, is speculated as a near-term target for airports.

5. **Skepticism and Analogies**  
   - Users analogize autonomous driving as "2D complexity" (navigating traffic) versus flying as "3D complexity" (trajectory planning, weather). However, aviation’s structured workflows may eventually favor automation more than roads.  
   - Jokes about drone crashes and "robotlords" underscore skepticism about fully autonomous flights in the near future.

**Takeaway**: While autonomous flying is technically feasible in controlled contexts (e.g., drones, cargo), regulatory, economic, and trust barriers make passenger planes a distant prospect. Autonomous cars, despite chaotic environments, benefit from incremental deployment and lower stakes, whereas aviation’s safety-first culture resists rapid disruption.

### Microsoft Favors Anthropic over OpenAI for Visual Studio Code

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/report/778641/microsoft-visual-studio-code-anthropic-claude-4) | 206 points | by [corvad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=corvad) | [93 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45263063)

Microsoft favors Anthropic’s Claude over OpenAI in VS Code’s new auto model picker

- Visual Studio Code is adding automatic AI model selection for GitHub Copilot that will choose between Claude Sonnet 4, GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, and others. Free users get dynamic selection; paid users will primarily run on Claude Sonnet 4.
- Internally, Microsoft has been steering developers to Claude 4 for coding tasks. An email from Microsoft dev chief Julia Liuson in June called Claude Sonnet 4 the recommended model based on internal benchmarks, a stance that reportedly hasn’t changed post–GPT-5.
- Microsoft is also testing Anthropic models inside Microsoft 365, where they’ve reportedly outperformed OpenAI for some Excel and PowerPoint features (per The Information).
- At the same time, Microsoft is ramping its own models: Mustafa Suleyman said MAI-1-preview was trained on a “tiny” 15,000 H100 cluster, with “significant investments” coming.
- This shift lands as Microsoft and OpenAI reshape their partnership, allowing OpenAI to use rival clouds and paving the way for a potential IPO—despite Microsoft’s $13B stake and revenue-sharing ties.

Why it matters: Copilot’s defaulting to Claude suggests Microsoft is increasingly model-agnostic in practice—and willing to prioritize whichever LLM performs best for dev workflows, even if that means favoring a rival over OpenAI while it builds up its own stack.

The Hacker News discussion reveals mixed reactions and insights on Microsoft's shift toward Anthropic's Claude in VS Code and Copilot:

1. **Strategic Business Motivations**:  
   Users compare Microsoft’s move to past strategies like promoting Teams over Slack, suggesting this reflects a pattern of prioritizing internal partnerships (e.g., Azure, Entra) despite existing relationships with competitors. Some speculate Microsoft aims to commoditize AI models while leveraging its ecosystem dominance.

2. **Model Performance Debates**:  
   - **Claude Strengths**: Many praise Claude Sonnet 4 for coding tasks, citing superior context window size (968k vs. GPT-5’s 368k), spatial/UI design understanding, and codebase navigation. Users report Claude excelling in React and frontend workflows.  
   - **GPT-5 Advantages**: Others argue GPT-5 outperforms Claude in math, complex architecture planning, and reducing hallucinations. One user notes GPT-5 handles formal proofs and large-scale system design better.  
   - **Niche Use Cases**: Perplexity and Gemini are mentioned for research, while Claude faces criticism for LaTeX rendering issues and occasional incorrect reasoning in math-heavy tasks.

3. **User Experience Criticisms**:  
   - Anthropic’s phone number verification requirement frustrates some, seen as a barrier for business use. Comparisons are drawn to services like Ticketmaster and Docusign, with debates on whether this prevents fraud or invades privacy.  
   - Mixed opinions on Claude’s UI: some find it cleaner, while others prefer GPT-5’s integration with GitHub and general reliability.

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   Commentators interpret Microsoft’s model-agnostic approach as hedging against OpenAI’s independence (e.g., potential IPO) while investing in its own models (MAI-1). Skeptics question if this signals commoditization of AI models, with Microsoft focusing on tooling rather than model ownership.

Overall, the thread reflects a split between users valuing Claude’s coding-specific strengths and those prioritizing GPT-5’s versatility, alongside skepticism about Microsoft’s strategic alignment with Anthropic.

### Forget RAG? Introducing KIP, a Protocol for a Living AI Brain

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ldclabs/KIP/wiki/Forget-RAG%3F-Introducing-KIP,-a-Protocol-for-a-Living-AI-Brain) | 9 points | by [zensh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zensh) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45264154)

The pitch: KIP (Knowledge Interaction Protocol) is an open spec that pairs an LLM’s “neural core” with a persistent, structured “symbolic core” (a knowledge graph) so agents can actually learn, update, and reason over time—rather than just retrieve text into a context window.

What’s new
- Beyond RAG: Instead of fetching unstructured chunks, KIP queries a graph of explicit concepts and propositions. It’s stateful, so the model can correct itself and compound knowledge.
- Two-way symbiosis: The LLM doesn’t just call a tool; it co-evolves the memory. KIP is the bridge between fast, real-time reasoning (LLM) and long-term memory (graph).
- LLM-native languages: KQL (query) and KML (manipulation) are declarative and designed to be generated by LLMs, resembling readable “chains of thought” the system can execute.
- Explainability: Answers can include the exact KQL used, making reasoning auditable.
- Persistent learning: “Knowledge Capsules” let agents UPSERT facts atomically. There’s a “Genesis Capsule” that defines the schema inside the graph, allowing the ontology to evolve.
- Identity built-in: Concepts like $self aim to give agents a stable, inspectable identity beyond prompts.

Why it matters
- Long-term, verifiable memory could make agents more reliable, personalized, and debuggable than pure RAG pipelines.
- A self-bootstrapping schema hints at adaptable domain models without hardcoding ontologies.

Caveats to watch
- Ontology drift and schema governance in the wild.
- Scalability and latency of graph ops under real workloads.
- Quality control for automated UPSERTs (garbage-in, garbage-stays).
- How “metabolic” forgetting is defined and enforced.
- Clear benchmarks vs. strong RAG baselines.

Status and links
- Spec: github.com/ldclabs/KIP
- Rust SDK and an implementation on Anda DB: github.com/ldclabs/anda-db
- Team comes from Web3 (ICPandaDAO) and frames this as infra for decentralized, autonomous AI agents.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Benchmarking & Performance Concerns:**  
   - Users noted the absence of stable benchmarks and raised concerns that added complexity from KIP might impact system performance. Current LLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 2.5 Pro) reportedly struggle to power KIP effectively, with one user citing unmet performance expectations in a Python app integrating KIP.  

2. **Integration Challenges with Existing LLMs:**  
   - While KIP’s vision of combining structured knowledge graphs with LLMs is seen as promising, participants highlighted limitations of current models. Even advanced LLMs like GPT-5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro were noted as insufficient for generating complex KIP queries or fully leveraging the framework.  

3. **Optimism for Future LLMs:**  
   - Despite current hurdles, there’s interest in exploring how stronger future LLMs could enhance KIP’s utility, particularly in generating intricate queries and evolving knowledge graphs. The combination of knowledge graphs with more capable models is viewed as a potential breakthrough area.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
The discussion reflects cautious optimism about KIP’s long-term potential but emphasizes the need for improved benchmarks, performance optimizations, and advancements in LLM capabilities to realize its full promise.

### Show HN: AI Code Detector – detect AI-generated code with 95% accuracy

#### [Submission URL](https://code-detector.ai/) | 71 points | by [henryl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=henryl) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45265831)

Span launches an “AI Code Detector” that claims to flag AI‑generated code regardless of which tool produced it. The system, span-detect-1, is a classifier trained on millions of AI- and human-written samples and operates on semantically segmented code “chunks,” labeling them as AI, human, or unknown.

Highlights
- How it works: Looks for style, syntax, and structural patterns in code chunks. Low-signal lines (e.g., imports/boilerplate) are marked “unknown” rather than guessed; ~10% of chunks fall into this bucket.
- Claimed accuracy: 95% on TypeScript and Python; varies with chunk size. Span says it tests on independent datasets to avoid overfitting.
- Source-agnostic: No vendor integrations or tagging required; intended to detect code from any AI assistant.
- Commercial use: Exposed via API and as part of Span’s developer intelligence platform to track adoption and outcomes (e.g., AI vs. human code ratio, defects at 90 days); “dose–response” on PR velocity is listed as coming soon.

Why it matters
Span is pitching this as a way for engineering leaders to quantify AI assistant usage and its quality impact in real repos—moving beyond vendor self-reporting.

Questions HN will likely ask
- Generalization beyond TS/Python? Robustness to style normalization or adversarial edits?
- False positive/negative costs at 95% accuracy; per-repo calibration?
- Privacy/security of code sent to the detector and governance implications for developer tracking.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Span's AI Code Detector:**

1. **Accuracy Concerns & Testing:**  
   - Users questioned the detector’s reliability, citing tests with contrasting code examples. A clean ChatGPT-generated Python script was flagged as 100% AI, while a messy student-written script was marked 0% AI. This raised doubts about false positives/negates based on code structure (e.g., clean vs. messy formatting).  
   - **Key Quote:** *“The messy script was detected 0% chance AI… clean script 100% confident AI”* – [mndz](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205638).  

2. **Adversarial Manipulation & Robustness:**  
   - Concerns arose about bypassing detection via stylistic edits (e.g., obfuscation, boilerplate tweaks). Commenters referenced research ([Sadasivan et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.11156)) showing detectors struggle as LLMs improve and distributions blur.  
   - Skepticism about long-term viability: *“Detection becomes impossible as models approach indistinguishability”* – [mndz](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205638).  

3. **Impact on Coding Practices:**  
   - Debates emerged about incentivizing “bad code” if detectors penalize clean AI-generated patterns. Some argued it might discourage developers from writing well-structured code to avoid false positives.  

4. **Technical Limitations:**  
   - Questions about language generalization (beyond Python/TypeScript) and reliance on training data biases. Span’s team hinted at future Ruby/C#/Java support but acknowledged challenges in cross-language generalization.  
   - Metrics critique: Users emphasized needing precision/recall over accuracy alone, especially given potential high costs of false classifications.  

5. **Practical Use Cases:**  
   - Interest in CI/CD integration to block low-quality AI PRs (*“Tired of AI trash PRs”* – [cmnx](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205638)).  
   - Concerns about privacy/security when sending code to third-party APIs.  

6. **Humorous Takes & Off-Topic Jokes:**  
   - A tongue-in-cheek comment about thermal insulation materials ([ldl12345](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205638)) humorously highlighted off-topic noise in discussions.  
   - Meta-jokes: *“AI code detector is itself AI-generated”* – [fncyfrdbt](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40205638).  

**Overall Sentiment:** Cautious interest in Span’s tool, tempered by skepticism about technical robustness, ethical implications, and long-term relevance as AI code quality evolves. Emphasis on transparency in metrics and dataset diversity.
