Moshi is taking the world of real-time dialogue by storm as an innovative speech-to-text foundation model. Developed by kyutai-labs, this fully duplex spoken dialogue framework leverages Mimi, a cutting-edge streaming neural audio codec that processes audio at amazing speeds. With a mere 80ms latency and impressive compression, Mimi handles high-quality audio better than traditional codecs. 

Moshi models dual audio streams—one from itself and another from the user—allowing for seamless interaction and improved text generation through an advanced transformer architecture that predicts its own audio tokens. Rendering text responses has never been so efficient, with theoretical latencies as low as 160ms on powerful GPUs.

The repository features multiple implementations, including Python versions for PyTorch and macOS MLX, alongside a Rust version. Several models and demos are also available for users eager to interact with Moshi live. 

With requirements detailing the latest Python versions and installation via PyPI, Moshi is accessible for developers seeking cutting-edge tools in dialogue systems, showcasing a step up in audio processing technology.

In the discussion surrounding the Moshi speech-to-text model, several users expressed diverse opinions on its performance and potential. Some praised Moshi's low latency of 80ms, noting that this makes it a significant advancement in real-time dialogue systems. Others, however, compared its capabilities to existing large language models (LLMs), suggesting that despite its strengths, Moshi's content generation quality resembled earlier models, such as those from 2019. 

There was also a recognition of how Moshi is built on advanced audio processing technology, utilizing a dual audio stream system to enhance interaction. However, some users questioned the overall effectiveness of its responses, highlighting that while the system had potential, there were instances where the quality of replies didn't meet expectations.

A few developers shared their experiences integrating Moshi with other technologies, like Whisper for speech-to-text tasks. Concerns were raised about the need for improvement in areas such as multi-model interaction, where some users felt the model struggled to maintain coherent conversations.

Overall, while there is excitement about Moshi's capabilities and advancements in latency and audio handling, there remains a level of skepticism regarding its content quality compared to the latest LLMs. Users are eager to see further developments and updates that could enhance both its conversational abilities and response accuracy.

### Larry Ellison's AI-Powered Surveillance Dystopia Is Already Here

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/larry-ellisons-ai-powered-surveillance-dystopia-is-already-here/) | 46 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41574396)

Hacker News today highlights a chilling vision of surveillance from Oracle's CEO, Larry Ellison, who envisions an omnipresent, AI-driven monitoring system that constantly surveils citizens. Speaking to investors, Ellison detailed how police body cameras, car cameras, and drones would stream video to Oracle's data centers, where AI would analyze the feeds. This concept raises urgent questions about privacy and the implications of such oversight, with Ellison asserting that constant monitoring will supposedly encourage both police and citizens to behave well. 

Ellison also proposed innovative but controversial solutions for school safety, leveraging AI to detect potential threats—an approach that has faced criticism for failing to deliver real security and often leading to misunderstandings and panic. Despite the ambition behind these tech solutions, there are significant concerns surrounding their actual efficacy, the potential for bias, and the overarching question of who truly benefits from such extensive surveillance. The warnings against a 1984-esque society seem more pertinent than ever, as Ellison's vision blurs the line between safety and surveillance, provoking intense ethical discussions among tech enthusiasts and the general public alike.

The discussion on Hacker News surrounding Larry Ellison's vision for AI-driven surveillance revealed various perspectives on the implications of such a system. Several commenters expressed skepticism toward Ellison's assurances that continuous monitoring would promote good behavior among both police and citizens. Some noted that relying on performance metrics for law enforcement could lead to negative outcomes and unintended consequences.

Others discussed the dangers of omnipresent surveillance, highlighting that it often fosters a sense of discomfort or paranoia in communities rather than genuine security. A few commenters drew parallels to community engagement strategies, arguing that fostering human connections and communication among neighbors is a more effective way to ensure safety than surveillance technologies.

Concerns about mental health repercussions and the potential for surveillance systems to exacerbate existing biases were also raised. Overall, the discussion underscored a deep unease about the trade-offs between proposed technological solutions for safety and the potential loss of personal privacy and community trust.
