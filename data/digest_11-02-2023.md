#### [Submission URL](https://www.businessinsider.com/sam-altman-and-demis-hassabis-just-want-to-control-ai-2023-10) | 768 points | by [g42gregory](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=g42gregory) | [826 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38108873)

Yann LeCun, the chief AI scientist at Meta, has criticized prominent AI leaders for spreading doomsday scenarios about AI risks. In a post on X, LeCun accused figures such as OpenAI's Sam Altman, Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis, and Anthropic's Dario Amodei of engaging in "fear-mongering" and "massive corporate lobbying" in order to gain control over the AI industry. LeCun argues that the real threat lies in a small number of companies controlling AI and robbing others of its riches, rather than in far-fetched doomsday scenarios. He believes that the focus should be on how AI is developed and the need for open collaboration rather than on hypothetical dangers.

Microsoft's use of automation and artificial intelligence (AI) to curate its news homepage, MSN.com, is causing controversy as false and bizarre stories are being amplified. The site, which is one of the most visited websites globally and a source of news for millions of Americans, has increasingly relied on AI over human editors. This shift has resulted in the publication of false claims and conspiracy theories. Microsoft's decision to lay off editors and replace them with automation has raised questions about the responsible use of AI and its impact on the journalism industry. The Guardian newspaper also accused Microsoft of damaging its reputation after republishing one of its articles alongside an AI-generated poll, which drew criticism from readers.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the use of AI in Microsoft's news curation on MSN.com and its impact on jobs, the quality of content, and potential biases. Some commenters argue that AI is replacing content writing jobs and that the negative effects of AI on jobs are being downplayed. Others highlight the importance of context, expressing concerns that AI-generated stories lack nuance and understanding. There is also speculation about Microsoft's motives and criticisms of its decision-making process. Some users raise questions about the responsibility of AI in journalism and its potential to spread false or bizarre stories.

New York City has a big rat problem, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is enlisting the help of its commuters to track the extent of the infestation. Over the past 30 days, more than 1.2 million New Yorkers have reported rat sightings at various subway stations through the MTA's Transit app. The results reveal that rats are present in almost every subway station, with some stations experiencing a higher percentage of rat sightings than others. The busiest stations have been identified as the most rat-infested, with the rodents appearing most active after dark, particularly around 2 AM. Interestingly, rats are more commonly spotted underground rather than in elevated subway stations. Despite efforts by the city's sanitation department, opinions among New Yorkers are divided on whether rats truly run the city or if it's the people who hold the power. The data collected through the app is used to improve the quality of the transit service and is shared with other riders and transit agencies. The project, known as "Rat-My-Ride," will publicly launch on October 2nd, providing more detailed data on rat sightings throughout the city's subway system.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to rats in New York City and their impact on the city and its residents. Here are some key points from the discussion:

- One user mentions that rats are a big problem in Manhattan but wonders if they are the primary problem causing issues in the city. They provide a link to an article showing that high percentages of restaurants in Manhattan have been found to have evidence of rat infestations.
- Another user comments that rats are not a significant threat to human health as they carry bacteria such as Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and Leptospira, which can also be carried by humans.
- Some users discuss the historical perspective of rats and their association with the Black Plague, questioning whether rats were the actual cause or just carriers of the disease.
- There is a debate about the role of rats in the ecosystem, with one user arguing that they interfere with the natural system and others suggesting that they have a place in the urban environment.
- One user mentions that rats cause mental health issues and major security problems in homeless shelters.
- There is a mention of the difficulty in controlling rat populations and the need for more effective measures.
- The discussion also touches on other topics like LoRaWAN technology for monitoring rat activity, the design of transit apps like Transit, and the presence of cats in buildings as potential rat deterrents.

These are just a few highlights from the discussion, which covers various perspectives and experiences related to the rat problem in New York City.
