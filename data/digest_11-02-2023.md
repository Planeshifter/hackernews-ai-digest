New York City has a big rat problem, and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is enlisting the help of its commuters to track the extent of the infestation. Over the past 30 days, more than 1.2 million New Yorkers have reported rat sightings at various subway stations through the MTA's Transit app. The results reveal that rats are present in almost every subway station, with some stations experiencing a higher percentage of rat sightings than others. The busiest stations have been identified as the most rat-infested, with the rodents appearing most active after dark, particularly around 2 AM. Interestingly, rats are more commonly spotted underground rather than in elevated subway stations. Despite efforts by the city's sanitation department, opinions among New Yorkers are divided on whether rats truly run the city or if it's the people who hold the power. The data collected through the app is used to improve the quality of the transit service and is shared with other riders and transit agencies. The project, known as "Rat-My-Ride," will publicly launch on October 2nd, providing more detailed data on rat sightings throughout the city's subway system.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to rats in New York City and their impact on the city and its residents. Here are some key points from the discussion:

- One user mentions that rats are a big problem in Manhattan but wonders if they are the primary problem causing issues in the city. They provide a link to an article showing that high percentages of restaurants in Manhattan have been found to have evidence of rat infestations.
- Another user comments that rats are not a significant threat to human health as they carry bacteria such as Clostridium difficile, Salmonella, and Leptospira, which can also be carried by humans.
- Some users discuss the historical perspective of rats and their association with the Black Plague, questioning whether rats were the actual cause or just carriers of the disease.
- There is a debate about the role of rats in the ecosystem, with one user arguing that they interfere with the natural system and others suggesting that they have a place in the urban environment.
- One user mentions that rats cause mental health issues and major security problems in homeless shelters.
- There is a mention of the difficulty in controlling rat populations and the need for more effective measures.
- The discussion also touches on other topics like LoRaWAN technology for monitoring rat activity, the design of transit apps like Transit, and the presence of cats in buildings as potential rat deterrents.

These are just a few highlights from the discussion, which covers various perspectives and experiences related to the rat problem in New York City.

### FTC: Amazon made $1B through secret price raising algorithms

#### [Submission URL](https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-details-ftc-antitrust-lawsuit-against-amazon-made-public-2023-11-02/) | 39 points | by [green-eclipse](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=green-eclipse) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38116637)

In a new court filing, the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has accused Amazon of using illegal strategies to increase its profits, including the use of an algorithm that raised prices for U.S. households by over $1 billion. The algorithm, called "Project Nessie," was created by Amazon to predict which products other online stores would follow in terms of price increases. After these stores matched or raised their prices, Amazon would continue to sell the products at inflated prices, resulting in excess profit. Amazon claims that the FTC has mischaracterized the pricing tool and that it stopped using it several years ago. The FTC also accuses Amazon of using the Signal messaging app's disappearing message feature to hide information from antitrust enforcers and of requiring sellers under its Prime feature to use its own logistics and delivery services. The lawsuit also alleges that Amazon treated Walmart.com differently than smaller sellers, prohibiting Walmart from selling on its platform and deterring the company from offering discounts to online shoppers who chose to pick up their purchases in-store.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the FTC's allegations against Amazon includes a few key points:

1. Some users point out that $1 billion in increased prices is a small fraction considering Amazon's annual profit of $250 billion. They argue that the potential risk of antitrust investigations is worth the relatively minimal monetary impact.

2. One user elicits the allegation that Amazon raised prices illegally, and another user responds with "delayed" without any further explanation.

3. A link to an archived version of the court filing is shared by a user.

4. Another user mentions that Amazon made its pricing algorithms public.

5. There is a user who mentions that the FTC's original lawsuit was filed in September, but not many reductions were made public until the recent version was filed in the US District Court in Seattle. One user in response states that they haven't checked or reviewed the details of the lawsuit.

Overall, the discussion seems to touch upon the potential impact of the allegations, the legality of Amazon's pricing strategies, the availability of court documents, and the timing of the lawsuit.
