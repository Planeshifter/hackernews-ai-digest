### RT-2 AI model translates vision and language into robotic actions

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/ai/google-deepmind-rt2-robotics-vla-model/) | 162 points | by [BhattMayurJ](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BhattMayurJ) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36905076)

Google DeepMind has unveiled its new vision-language-action (VLA) model, Robotics Transformer 2 (RT-2), which enables robots to better understand and perform actions in both familiar and new situations. Unlike traditional robot learning methods that involve training robots on billions of data points, RT-2 uses a small amount of robot training data and transfers concepts from its language and vision training data to direct robot actions. In testing, RT-2 performed as well as its predecessor on trained tasks and almost doubled its performance on novel tasks. This advancement brings us closer to a future of helpful robots that can rapidly adapt to new environments and situations.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the capabilities and limitations of Google DeepMind's new Robotics Transformer 2 (RT-2) model. Some users express skepticism about the model's understanding of detailed movements and its ability to handle complex tasks. Others highlight the challenges of reverse-engineering the cognitive processes involved in human movements. There is also a discussion about the collection and generalization of data for machine learning models and the potential implications of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Some users provide additional resources for further reading on the subject.

### WebArena: A realistic web environment for building autonomous agents

#### [Submission URL](https://webarena.dev/) | 78 points | by [jeron](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jeron) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36901815)

WebArena is a web environment for building autonomous agents, and it's now available for users to try out. With functionality and data designed to mimic real-world scenarios, WebArena creates websites from popular categories like social forums, online shopping, content management, and more. It also includes tools and knowledge resources to help agents emulate human problem-solving. One interesting feature of WebArena is its benchmark for interpreting high-level natural language commands and executing web-based interactions. It offers a set of realistic tasks that require long-term planning and reasoning capabilities, such as finding art museums in Pittsburgh, optimizing travel itineraries, and updating README files. Users can explore the WebArena website demos and even try out the tasks themselves. This tool could be a valuable resource for developers and researchers working on autonomous agents and natural language understanding.

### Real life indirection is the root of all evil, and AI agents can fix it

#### [Submission URL](https://marianogappa.github.io/software/2023/07/28/real-life-indirection-is-the-root-of-all-evil-and-ai-agents-can-fix-it/) | 29 points | by [maloga](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=maloga) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36906175)

A recent blog post explores the concept of "indirection in the real world" and how it can lead to negative consequences. Indirection, a principle in computer programming, is not inherently bad, but too much of it can lead to difficulty in understanding code or navigating complicated systems. The author argues that indirection is present in various aspects of daily life, such as relying on others for food, shelter, and safety. While indirection has led to improvements in society, it also contributes to issues like war, inequality, obesity, and political corruption. The post suggests that transparency is a key solution to mitigate these problems by removing the indirection and exposing the underlying issues. Examples of transparency efforts include health warnings on packaging and whistleblowing to expose tax evasion and hidden wealth.
