#### [Submission URL](https://fleetwood.dev/posts/you-could-have-designed-SOTA-positional-encoding) | 182 points | by [Philpax](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Philpax) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166948)

In a recent deep dive into the evolution of positional encoding for transformer models, a fascinating exploration on improving self-attention mechanisms was shared. The post guides readers through the iterative discovery of Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), a significant enhancement featured in the latest LLama 3.2 release, by breaking down the requirements and methodologies in an accessible way.

The challenge stems from the inherent permutation invariance of self-attention: without positional information, identical tokens in different contexts, such as "dog" in "The dog chased another dog," yield indistinguishable outputs. To tackle this, the author outlines desirable properties for an effective positional encoding scheme: unique encodings for every position, linear relationships between positions for intuitive learning, adaptability to variable sequence lengths, a deterministic generation process, and extensibility to multidimensional data.

Starting with a preliminary method of integer position encoding, the article critiques the shortcomings of naïve approaches—like exceeding the semantic signal with position values—while guiding readers through the complexities of implementing a successful encoding strategy. This exploration serves not only as an insightful analysis of RoPE but also as a reminder of the intricate dance between simplicity and complexity in building effective AI models.

### AI-generated poetry is indistinguishable from human-written and more favorably

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1) | 14 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166405)

A recent study reveals that AI-generated poetry has reached an impressive level of sophistication, making it virtually indistinguishable from human-written works, at least for non-expert readers. In experiments involving over 16,000 participants, results showed that people scored only 46.6% accuracy in identifying the authorship of poems, often mistaking AI-generated pieces for those penned by renowned poets. Interestingly, these AI poems were rated more favorably in terms of rhythm and beauty, suggesting that their relative simplicity might make them more appealing to the average reader. This trend highlights a common bias, where non-experts misinterpret the complexity of human poetry as incoherence, believing instead that the more straightforward AI poems are of human origin. While previous studies showed a bias against recognizing AI art, this new research flips the narrative, suggesting that AI-generated poetry could be seen as "more human than human." However, once participants knew a poem was AI-generated, their ratings dropped significantly, confirming the ongoing skepticism around AI's creative capabilities.

In the discussion sparked by the study on AI-generated poetry, commenters offered varying perspectives. Some expressed skepticism about the significance of the findings, pondering the relevance of distinguishing between human and AI authorship, highlighting that the perceived quality remains subjective. Others pointed out that while AI-generated poetry was rated highly in terms of rhyme and beauty, it was often confused with works from well-known human poets, suggesting that the simplicity in AI poetry may appeal to readers unfamiliar with poetic intricacies.

A few participants emphasized that their experiences with generating poetry using AI tools had yielded results comparable to those of famous poets, noting that even blind taste tests showed favor toward AI-created works. However, there's acknowledgment of ongoing bias against AI as creative entities, especially when participants learned the poems were AI-generated, which led to lower ratings. Overall, the conversation indicated a complex relationship with AI's potential in creative fields, touching on issues of authorship, quality assessment, and the subjective nature of literary appreciation.
