#### [Submission URL](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/openai-asks-white-house-relief-100000706.html) | 705 points | by [jonbaer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jonbaer) | [638 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43352531)

In today's update from the tech world, OpenAI is taking a proactive step to help shape future AI regulations in the US. The company has reached out to the Trump administration, advocating for federal protection against the hodgepodge of state-level regulations targeting AI technologies. OpenAI suggests that in exchange for AI companies voluntarily sharing their models with the federal government, they should receive relief from these state rules. This move comes as numerous AI-related bills are in the works across the country, potentially hampering technological advancement amid competitive pressures from China.

OpenAI's proposal includes leveraging the US AI Safety Institute as a liaison between the government and the private sector. By fostering a harmonious relationship through voluntary model reviews, companies could gain liability protections and avoid state-based regulations that may not align with federal standards. Moreover, OpenAI emphasizes the importance of robust AI infrastructure investments and copyright reform, particularly highlighting concerns over data access that could impede US competitiveness in AI.

The company also urges for access to government-held data, which they argue would significantly enhance AI development. With a delicate balance between innovation and regulation at play, OpenAI’s proposals aim to ensure the US maintains its edge in the global AI race. This dialogue is part of a broader discussion initiated by the White House as it drafts policies to underpin AI leadership.

Meanwhile, market updates reveal a reactive day for traders with notable stock movements, such as Intel's impressive rise by over 15% and Adobe's notable drop by more than 13%. Stay tuned for more unfolding developments as both the tech sphere and the markets navigate through these dynamic times.

### C Plus Prolog

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/needleful/c_plus_prolog) | 163 points | by [mpweiher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpweiher) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43357955)

In a fascinating attempt to blend two worlds, the GitHub repository "C Plus Prolog" proposes an innovative fusion of Prolog and C programming languages, aptly named "C+P." This creative endeavor seeks to combine the deductive logic prowess of Prolog with the practical capabilities of C. The repository's creator humorously positions this as a longstanding scientific pursuit to merge these seemingly incompatible languages into a cohesive whole.

The readme takes you on a whimsical journey where Prolog, often known for its terse and cryptic elegance, adopts C-like verbosity, including unusual quirks such as using Prolog's syntax quirks to mimic C structures. This mash-up introduces novel syntax, like altering common operators and employing new ones such as `*@`, or presenting unique handling of character literals and variable types. The *=> operator stands out; it's used for pattern matching in code, akin to defining macros but on Prolog terms.

Moreover, C+P offers a peculiar take on generics, presenting a system that functions like C++ templates but with a touch of manual involvement. The Prolog aspect allows powerful compile-time manipulations, showcasing its potential in transcending mere syntactic translations to achieving robust expression in code logic.

Even if Prolog isn’t touted as the universal solution, nor C its sole companion in utility, C Plus Prolog demonstrates a unique amalgam that could inspire and puzzle many a coder in equal measure. It's a compelling experiment in programming language design that blazes a trail holders of traditional syntaxes might find worth exploring.

The Hacker News discussion around the "C Plus Prolog" submission explores Prolog's strengths, challenges, and real-world applications, alongside comparisons to other tools. Key points include:

1. **Prolog’s Core Mechanics**:  
   - Debates on Prolog’s **non-deterministic search** (e.g., depth-first vs. breadth-first) clarify that while execution is deterministic, backtracking enables flexible problem-solving. Users note logical correctness matters more than search strategy.  
   - **Constraint-solving** examples, like scheduling workers with shift rules, highlight Prolog’s declarative power but also frustration with cryptic syntax and debugging complex constraints.

2. **Use Cases and Alternatives**:  
   - Prolog is praised for **theorem proving**, **planning**, and **parsing** (via Definite Clause Grammars), but users suggest alternatives like **Answer Set Programming (ASP)** for combinatorial optimization (e.g., Potassco’s tools) or **Z3** for SAT/SMT solvers.  
   - Some share projects blending Prolog with **JavaScript** or **C**, sparking discussions on hybridizing relational and imperative paradigms, akin to Haskell’s approach.

3. **Learning Curve and Practicality**:  
   - Newcomers face a steep curve, especially when tackling low-level tasks or transitioning from functional/OOP backgrounds. Resources like SWI-Prolog, Scryer, and Markus Triska’s tutorials are recommended.  
   - Critiques focus on **performance limitations** in real-world apps and the need for hybrid approaches (e.g., mixing Prolog with C for speed).  

4. **Niche Applications**:  
   - Nostalgic mentions of Prolog in **legacy systems** (e.g., Windows NT network configuration) contrast with modern uses in logic puzzles, educational tools, or game AI.  

**Verdict**: Prolog remains a powerful tool for logic-driven problems, but its adoption is tempered by syntax quirks, performance constraints, and the rise of specialized tools like ASP/Z3. Enthusiasts advocate for its unique strengths, while pragmatists lean on hybrids or alternatives.

### AI Search Has a Citation Problem

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cjr.org/tow_center/we-compared-eight-ai-search-engines-theyre-all-bad-at-citing-news.php) | 19 points | by [nobody9999](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nobody9999) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43356547)

Today, we're diving into a hot topic shaking up the world of digital journalism—generative AI search tools replacing traditional search engines. These AI-driven tools are seeing increasing use, with nearly a quarter of Americans turning to them instead of Google or Bing. However, as they repurpose content for users, they're triggering a lot of concern among news publishers.

The Tow Center for Digital Journalism recently tested eight chatbots with live search capabilities to see how accurately they retrieve and attribute news articles. Unfortunately, findings show a staggering tendency for these bots to confidently deliver incorrect information. Across different platforms, inaccuracy varied, with some, like Grok 3, having an error rate of 94%. Even premium models, supposedly superior due to their cost, often exhibited a paradox of offering more incorrect answers than their free counterparts, especially in comparison to platforms like Perplexity Pro.

The bots' major failing is not only in their factual inaccuracies but in their presentation. Many deliver incorrect information without qualifying phrases or acknowledging their knowledge gaps, creating a deceptive aura of reliability. This misleading confidence could potentially influence users into believing falsehoods with undue certainty.

Even more concerning is how some chatbots accessed content from publishers who had blocked their crawlers, questioning ethical boundaries and the respect of digital preferences outlined in the Robots Exclusion Protocol. Only five of the eight tested chatbots made their crawler names public, allowing publishers an opportunity to block them, indicating trust and transparency issues in the industry.

As these tools grow, there's a greater urgency in scrutinizing how they access and present news. Publishers, developers, and end-users need to jointly consider the implications of their use to ensure the health of digital journalistic ecosystems and the integrity of information dissemination.

The discussion explores various challenges and concerns with generative AI tools in generating and citing content. Key points include:

1. **Inaccuracies and Fabrications**: Users report tools like Microsoft Copilot frequently citing incorrect or fabricated documents. Fabricated sources and information ("hallucinations") are noted as significant issues, especially in critical domains like medicine or law, raising legal and trustworthiness concerns.

2. **Verification Challenges**: AI-generated summaries often lack verifiable sourcing, and while some tools (e.g., Claude) attempt source validation, they may still rewrite content improperly instead of direct citation. Token limitations (e.g., lengthy URLs) also hinder accurate attribution.

3. **Ethical and Technical Limitations**: AI tools sometimes disregard publisher opt-outs (Robots Exclusion Protocol) and blend factual content with fiction, muddying reliability. Users also highlight the time-consuming nature of verifying AI outputs.

4. **Mixed Tool Performance**: While some tools (e.g., Perplexity) are praised for specific use cases, sourcing issues persist across platforms. The discussion underscores the need for improved validation frameworks and transparency to ensure accountability as AI adoption grows. 

Overall, participants stress the urgency of addressing accuracy, ethical sourcing, and technical constraints to mitigate risks in critical applications.

### It's not cheating if you write the video game solver yourself

#### [Submission URL](https://robertheaton.com/cocoon/) | 21 points | by [ozanonay](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ozanonay) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43356100)

When the author's family embarked on a trip, leaving him solo at home, it wasn't just an opportunity to binge-watch TV and feast on takeout; it was time to tackle the video game "Cocoon." This artsy puzzle game features a bee-like protagonist navigating abstract worlds within four orbs. As he delves into these orb-contained universes, intricate puzzles unfold, pushing the player's cognitive limits.

Day one of this gamer retreat saw the author thoroughly entertained by the game’s ambiance and cleverly designed challenges, even though he craved a story beyond its metaphorical gestures towards entropy and decay. By day two, he hit the proverbial wall, stuck at a particular puzzle. Not one to be defeated, he devised a novel approach: write a computer program to solve the puzzle for him.

Determining that programming a solution was more of an intellectual exercise than actual cheating, he set out to model the game using a finite state machine—a conceptual device for capturing the possible states and transitions within the game. By recreating the game's mechanics virtually, he aimed to instruct his program to navigate the abstract conundrum that thwarted him.

Though "Cocoon" is layered in complexity and symbolism, the author found a way to blend his love for programming and gaming, transforming his solo time into an unexpected yet enriching coding journey. A finite state machine became his chosen tool, allowing analytical insight and a simulated victory over a video game challenge. This geek-out session was his kind of 'vacation', proving fun is in the journey of creative self-solutions.

The discussion revolves around two primary threads:  

1. **Programming & Puzzle-Solving**:  
   - User **jmhll** highlights the intellectual appeal of designing programs to solve games, such as Sudoku solvers, framing it as a creative challenge.  
   - **mk_chan** responds by noting they stopped playing chess once they lost interest but now casually play with friends while focusing on programming.  
   - **nwllnghff** praises programming as a masterful skill, emphasizing its value in problem-solving.  

2. **Reflections on Family & Time**:  
   - **knd775** ambiguously references family trips or dynamics (likely tying into the article’s theme of solo time during family absences).  
   - **rmrm** critiques the article as confusing, suggesting it “doesn’t make sense” or feels inadequately explained.  
   - **dnkmn** counters with a philosophical take, musing that “absence makes the heart grow fonder” and championing time spent on personal pursuits (e.g., programming) as fulfilling.  

The conversation balances technical enthusiasm for coding challenges with personal anecdotes about solitude, family, and intellectual satisfaction.
