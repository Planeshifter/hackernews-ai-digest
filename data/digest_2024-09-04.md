### Canva says its new AI features justify raising subscription prices by 300%

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2024/09/03/canva-hiking-teams-subscription-prices-ai-features/) | 29 points | by [doener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41446598)

Canva is making headlines with its decision to boost subscription prices for its "Teams" service by up to 300%, marking the first significant increase since 2020. The popular design platform, known for its user-friendly interface, attributes this steep price hike to the introduction of advanced AI-powered features, particularly its new Magic Studio—a comprehensive toolset for generating images, videos, and more.

As of early December, U.S. users will see their Teams subscription soar from $119.99 per year to $500, with a temporary discount of $300 for the first year. While Canva claims these changes are necessary for enhancing team collaboration and streamlining design processes, many users are expressing concern that the price jump could alienate smaller teams that have contributed to Canva's success through grassroots advocacy.

Some users, however, see the increased cost as justifiable given the platform's expanded capabilities. As the debate continues, Canva maintains that its Pro plans remain unchanged, keeping the platform accessible for those not requiring team-based features. With ongoing talks surrounding a potential IPO, Canva's future pricing and product evolution remain on the minds of both avid fans and critics alike.

The discussion surrounding Canva's steep price increase for its "Teams" subscription has revealed a mix of opinions among users. Some participants express skepticism about the sustainability of subscription models, citing concerns that the high cost, which is increasing by up to 300%, could alienate smaller teams that are crucial to Canva's grassroots support. Others argue that the addition of advanced features, particularly AI capabilities, justifies the price hike. 

Several commenters point out the disconnect between subscription pricing and the value delivered, emphasizing that while some tools may offer innovative features, the financial burden could limit access for users who rely on affordable solutions. There's also a broader discourse on trends within the tech industry, with some suggesting that many companies, similar to Canva, are testing the limits of user tolerance for pricing changes in light of new technologies.

Additional comments reflect on past experiences with subscription services, with users sharing sentiments about the viability of such models. The general consensus seems to indicate a need for careful consideration of user needs and market dynamics as companies evolve their pricing strategies.
