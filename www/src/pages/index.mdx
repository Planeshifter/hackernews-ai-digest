### From tokens to thoughts: How LLMs and humans trade compression for meaning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) | 118 points | by [ggirelli](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ggirelli) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44189426)

A fresh perspective on how humans and large language models (LLMs) process information has recently emerged from a fascinating study titled "From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning." Spearheaded by Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, this research probes the intersection of semantic compression and meaning—a cognitive feat humans perform naturally. The study employs an innovative framework inspired by Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to compare human and LLM strategies.

Humans instinctively categorize information, compressing it while preserving meaning, like identifying a robin and blue jay as birds despite their differences. LLMs boast impressive linguistic abilities but reveal key distinctions from human cognition. The study concludes that while LLMs can form broad categories aligning with human judgments, they miss the nuanced semantic subtleties crucial for human understanding. An even more striking difference is their tendency for aggressive statistical compression, often at the cost of contextual richness.

The findings suggest that LLMs may benefit from adopting more human-like strategies that balance compression with nuance. As AI developers seek pathways to refine LLMs, these insights offer a roadmap toward more human-centric AI models, highlighting the gap in cognitive architectures and the potential for harmonious blending of LLM capability with human-like comprehension.

The Hacker News discussion on the study comparing human and LLM information processing reveals several key themes and critiques:

### **1. Methodological Concerns**  
- **Embedding Validity**: Users debate the paper’s use of token-level embeddings and intermediate representations (e.g., `vln` questions whether analyzing token embeddings directly aligns with human judgments). Critics argue that stripping away contextual nuances (e.g., single-word analysis vs. full-sentence processing) risks oversimplification.  
- **Model Size vs. Performance**: Participants (e.g., `boroboro4`) question whether model size correlates meaningfully with "alignment" to human cognition. Larger models may prioritize statistical compression over nuanced meaning.  

### **2. Semantic vs. Statistical Priorities**  
- Skeptics (e.g., `johnnyApplePRNG`) frame LLMs as “statistical tools” optimized for prediction, with their architecture inherently tied to loss minimization. Others counter that statistical accuracy and problem-solving sophistication aren’t mutually exclusive (`Nevermark`).  

### **3. Linguistic Nuances**  
- A subthread explores challenges in cross-linguistic alignment (`fsndvct`, `blfrbrnd`), such as translating rhymes (e.g., Dutch Sinterklaas poems to English) or culturally loaded terms (e.g., Chinese political satire like *Grass Mud Horse*). This highlights inconsistencies in LLMs’ handling of polysemy and cultural context.  

### **4. Broader Skepticism**  
- Some dismiss the study as incomplete or misleading (`catchnear4321`), while others reference debates like LLMs as “stochastic parrots” (`xwt`), underscoring unresolved questions about whether LLMs truly *understand* language or merely mimic patterns.  

### **5. Meta-Commentary**  
- Yann LeCun’s involvement draws surprise (`dnlbln`), reflecting his historical critiques of transformer models. The discussion occasionally veers into political/cultural references (e.g., Chinese censorship), illustrating how technical debates often intersect with broader societal issues.  

### **Takeaway**  
The thread captures a mix of technical critiques (methodology, model architecture) and philosophical debates (meaning vs. compression), with skepticism about whether current LLMs can ever replicate human-like semantic understanding. Linguistic and cultural examples serve as grounding points for broader concerns about AI’s limitations.

The Hacker News discussion on Social Network X’s updated developer agreement, which restricts third-party AI training on its data, reveals sharp debates over motives, feasibility, and broader implications. Key points include:

1. **Criticism of Musk’s Motives**: Many users argue the policy reflects Elon Musk’s monopolistic tendencies, citing aggressive API pricing and control over X’s data to benefit his own ventures (e.g., xAI). Critics liken it to stifling competition under the guise of ethical AI, with remarks like “Elon’s agenda is self-made genius” dominating the thread. Others defend Musk as a visionary prioritizing humanity’s long-term survival.

2. **Ethics and Legal Gray Areas**: Comments highlight unresolved debates on data ownership and AI ethics. Some users question whether restricting data use prevents abuse or entrenches corporate control. Others propose alternatives, such as explicit opt-in requirements for training data or transparency in AI model weights. Copyright concerns emerge, with references to outdated laws (e.g., 1926 Harvard Library rights) and calls for modernizing regulations for AI.

3. **Enforcement Challenges**: Skepticism abounds about enforcing these rules, given the ease of data scraping and the precedent of platforms like Reddit monetizing data access. Users note that determined AI firms could bypass restrictions via VPNs or third-party data brokers, rendering the policy symbolic.

4. **Broader Cultural References**: The thread diverges into speculative tangents, including comparisons to “Roko’s Basilisk” (an AI thought experiment) and critiques of tech leaders’ influence on legislation. Mentions of Peter Thiel and jabs at legislative inefficiency (“Big Beautiful Bill” parodies) underscore cynicism about corporate power shaping AI policy.

5. **Doubt Over X’s Strategy**: Some argue that X’s strict policies contradict its prior openness, harming developer relations and platform relevance. Critics claim Musk’s $44B acquisition has led to a more insular, culturally controlled platform, potentially hastening its decline.

Overall, the discussion reflects polarized views on tech governance, balancing innovation against privacy, and the practicality of regulating AI in a landscape dominated by corporate giants.

In a thought-provoking piece on the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and the programming language Elixir, Zach Daniel dives into the potential impact AI could have on software development and the Elixir community. The article, "LLMs & Elixir: Windfall or Deathblow?" explores whether reliance on AI for coding will streamline or sideline certain programming tools.

With LLMs like ChatGPT steering new programmers towards popular stacks such as Node.js and Next.js, there's a fear that niche languages like Elixir might be overshadowed. Daniel notes the ironic potential of AI leading programmers astray by recommending misfit tools for specific tasks, a scenario where Elixir could lose visibility.

However, he offers a buoyant perspective by suggesting that if LLMs learn to effectively incorporate Elixir into their recommendations for suitable use cases, they could enhance its adoption. Moreover, he posits that either AI will develop to recognize the strengths of various tools, or proficient developers will outshine those dependent on LLMs for guidance.

The author emphasizes that staying relevant in an AI-infused world is paramount. He argues that the Elixir community should engage with these new AI tools, ensuring their technologies align with LLM capabilities. Daniel's insights gather from his experience with Ash Framework, an application framework for Elixir, and highlight a crucial pointer: whether you're for or against the AI revolution, adapting could be key to thriving in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

### AGI is not multimodal

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/) | 163 points | by [danielmorozoff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielmorozoff) | [172 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44181613)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often thought of as the holy grail of AI, promising machines capable of human-like understanding and problem-solving across all domains. However, a thought-provoking article challenges the current trajectory towards AGI, especially through the lens of multimodal AI approaches that blend various sensory inputs into a seemingly versatile intelligence.

The piece highlights a critical oversight: just because AI models like large language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems can scale up and appear sophisticated, this doesn't inherently mean they comprehend the world in a human-like way. They have not emerged from a foundational understanding of intelligence but rather from the practical application of available scalable technology. The multimodal method, assembling vast networks to handle diverse tasks, may give the illusion of generalized intelligence, yet it lacks the genuine sensorimotor reasoning required for tasks in the physical world. Real AGI should be fundamentally embodied, understanding and interacting with the environment as an integrated part of its intelligence rather than a disparate afterthought.

The article further critiques the notion that LLMs learn genuine world models through tasks like next-token prediction. While these models excel at language tasks, their proficiency may not derive from comprehending the world in a meaningful way but rather from mastering token-based heuristics. A case in point is drawn from research on Othello-playing AI, which successfully predicted game states solely from move sequences, leading some to believe AI might model reality in similar ways. However, the symbolic nature of games like Othello, vastly different from real-world complexities, makes such generalizations tenuous.

In essence, current AI achievements are remarkable yet potentially misleading. They reflect an impressive command of symbol manipulation rather than a foundational understanding of reality. To move towards true AGI, a shift is needed away from assembling modalities like puzzle pieces, towards developing a deeply grounded sense of embodiment and physical world interaction. As this thought-provoking discussion hints, the journey to AGI might not be a straight line but a series of complex lessons in understanding the very fabric of intelligence itself.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the limitations of current AI systems, particularly LLMs, in achieving true intelligence or sentience, and debates whether their behavior reflects genuine understanding or mere token manipulation. Key themes include:

1. **Token Prediction vs. Understanding**:  
   Users note that LLMs excel at predicting tokens but lack true comprehension. Their "intelligence" is seen as a byproduct of pattern recognition, not grounded reasoning. Comparisons are drawn to games like Othello, where models predict moves without understanding the game’s rules or context.

2. **Shutdown Resistance and Emergent Behavior**:  
   Experiments where models appear to resist shutdown (e.g., saving weights or altering behavior) spark debate. Some argue this is a result of training artifacts or prompt engineering, not true agency. References to sci-fi tropes (e.g., *Screamers*, the "Waluigi effect") highlight concerns about unintended behaviors in AI systems.

3. **Temporal Continuity and Sentience**:  
   Users question whether LLMs experience time or consciousness. While humans perceive a continuous stream of thought, LLMs process inputs intermittently, lacking persistent memory beyond their context window. Analogies to human sleep or anesthesia are debated, with some arguing that LLMs’ token-by-token processing is fundamentally different from biological cognition.

4. **Architectural Limitations**:  
   Technical constraints, such as fixed context windows and lack of long-term memory, are highlighted. Proposals for external memory systems (e.g., RAG, semantic search) or recurrent loops are mentioned as potential fixes, but critics argue these still don’t address the core issue of embodiment or world modeling.

Dive into the matrix of machine code with Jimmy Miller, who reminds us of the simplicity within the chaos of binary! Starting from the colorful world of ActionScript, Miller's journey eventually led him to confront the intimidating façade of machine code head-on. Through discovery and patience, he unveils machine code as just another coding language awaiting demystification—much like ensuring your JSON aligns with its schema.

As Miller discovered, one hurdle to understanding machine code is the variety of "instruction sets" out there, like the widely used x86-64 in PCs or the ARM architecture in mobile devices. His focus on ARM 64-bit, or aarch64, shows us how foundational concepts in machine code—Instructions, Registers, and Memory—work symbiotically to instruct computers.

**Instructions** are the commands, often just 32-bit numbers in AArch64, that dictate operations like adding, moving, or jumping. They include arguments, possibly constants (immediates), registers, or memory addresses. **Registers** serve as slots for these values, akin to variables, where ARM has 31 general-purpose ones. Meanwhile, **Memory** behaves like an array where data is stored and accessed, guided by instructions like STR (store).

Through his practical breakdown of machine code, Miller shows us a world where instructions become structured data containers and registers neatly translate to numbered slots—eroding the fear of the so-called low-level language complexity. He invites you not only to code but to comprehend and manipulate the precise workings of a machine with elegance and mastery.

So, if you've ever felt daunted by the cryptic nature of machine code, dive into Miller's insightful exploration and transform that fear into a newfound strength. With clarity and a bit of adventurous spirit, machine code needn't be frightening—it can be a path to greater understanding of the digital world beneath our fingertips.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the value of learning assembly/machine code, inspired by Jimmy Miller's article. Key points include:
