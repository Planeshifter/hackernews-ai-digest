### Encoding tic-tac-toe in 15 bits

#### [Submission URL](https://cbarrick.dev/posts/2024/02/19/tic-tac-toe) | 129 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39456135)

Alejandra González, also known as @blyxyas, recently shared a fascinating blog post on how to encode a tic-tac-toe game state using as few bits as possible. While she managed to compress it into 18 bits, the challenge was to do even better. By representing each cell with a pair of bits (one for a circle, one for a cross), the grid could be encoded using only 15 bits. This clever solution allowed for efficient implementation of core methods like getting and setting cell values using bit manipulation.

However, the quest for optimization didn't stop there. By viewing the game state as a base-3 number and each cell as a digit in base-3, it was possible to further reduce the memory usage to 16 bits. This approach required rethinking the methods to work with base-3 digits and involved a bit more complexity compared to the base-4 representation. Ultimately, the choice between the two representations depended on specific needs, with the base-4 option offering better CPU performance due to simpler operations.

While the base-3 representation might not be a common choice for most applications, it could offer significant memory savings in scenarios requiring storage of a vast number of uncompressed game states. This exercise in optimization showcases the creativity and thought process involved in finding efficient solutions, even if they might seem like a wild case of premature optimization at first glance.

The top story on Hacker News today covers a fascinating paper titled "GALA3D: Towards Text-to-3D Complex Scene Generation via Layout-guided Generative Gaussian Splatting." This research introduces a user-friendly approach for generating 3D scenes from text descriptions, leveraging large language models and layout-guided control. The framework enables the creation of realistic 3D scenes with consistent geometry, texture, and scale, showcasing state-of-the-art advancements in scene-level 3D content generation.

The paper details the overall framework of GALA3D, which involves creating a coarse layout from text descriptions, refining the layout with adaptive geometric constraints, optimizing 3D content generation through compositional diffusions, and refining the layout for better adherence to real-world scene constraints. The research includes qualitative comparisons with other methods like SJC, ProlificDreamer, and more, highlighting the efficacy of GALA3D in generating high-fidelity 3D scenes.

Moreover, the paper showcases various generated samples, such as a bedroom with furniture, a cat on a plank of wood, and a camping scene, demonstrating the versatility and creativity of the GALA3D framework. Additionally, the paper explores scene editing capabilities, allowing users to manipulate elements within generated scenes, like adding a cardboard box or moving objects around.

Overall, the GALA3D paper presents an innovative and comprehensive approach to text-to-3D scene generation, offering a groundbreaking solution for creating immersive and realistic 3D environments. The framework's user-friendly interface and ability to maintain object-level fidelity within scenes make it a valuable contribution to the field of 3D content generation.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around the topic of text-to-3D scene generation presented in the GALA3D paper. Here are some key points from the discussion:

1. **User Concerns:** There is a user expressing reluctance towards engaging in lengthy discussions about computer-generated 3D models, emphasizing the importance of practicality and real-world applications in disciplines working with 3D models professionally.
2. **Workflow Efficiency:** Another user mentions the potential of AI in improving workflow efficiency, highlighting the balance between automated processes and human intervention in model creation.
3. **Research Comparison:** Discussants draw parallels with OpenAI's work on GPT-2 and Google's research, debating the potential utility of generative 3D scenes in comparison.
4. **Control in Scene Generation:** Users mention projects like ControlNet and StableDiffusion as examples of systems that provide control over generated 3D scenes, contrasting them with the text-guided approach of GALA3D.
5. **Text-to-3D Challenges:** There is a discussion on the challenges and potential of text-to-3D modeling, with considerations about model fidelity, sparsity of functional shapes in text descriptions, and the efficiency of descriptive languages like OpenSCAD.
6. **Application in Game Development:** Mention of procedural rigging physics-based generative animations in game development as a practical application of combining different technologies.
7. **Political Connotations:** A brief exchange delves into political aspects, referencing a comparison involving artificial intelligence and the Cold War between big powers.

In summary, the conversation delves into the intricacies of text-guided 3D scene generation, the challenges in model control and accuracy, potential real-world applications, and even touches upon political interpretations in the context of advanced technologies.
