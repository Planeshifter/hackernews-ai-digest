### The LLMentalist Effect

#### [Submission URL](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/) | 114 points | by [zahlman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zahlman) | [110 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983571)

In a thought-provoking piece, Baldur Bjarnason explores the phenomenon he dubs the "LLMentalist Effect," likening the perceived intelligence of chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the age-old art of psychic con tricks. He argues that, despite public perception, LLMs lack the capacity for true reasoning or intelligence. Instead, like a psychic employing "cold reading" techniques, LLMs effectively use statistical guesses and validation statements to create an illusion of understanding and specificity.

Bjarnason suggests that this misconception is much like what happens in a psychic’s con: people see intelligence where none exists, fueled by a psychological trick akin to the Forer effect—a tendency to accept vague and general statements as highly accurate for oneself. He observes that some LLM enthusiasts exhibit a mix of awe and skepticism reminiscent of those charmed by psychic readings.

Critically, Bjarnason illuminates the process behind psychic cons, drawing fascinating parallels to AI interactions. He explains how psychics—and by extension, LLMs—craft convincing illusions by catering to eagerly self-selecting audiences, setting charismatic scenes, and offering statements that appear personalized yet are broadly applicable. Through such tactics, both tap into subjective validation to leave their audiences believing that something truly extraordinary has occurred.

Ultimately, Bjarnason stresses that while many use cases for LLMs appear valuable, they risk veering into the realm of pseudoscience and overhyped tech narratives if not scrutinized carefully. Concluding with a nod to skepticism, his insights invite us to question the nature of intelligence and how easily we can be enchanted by the seemingly miraculous capabilities of both psychics and machines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion**

The discussion explores the analogy between LLMs and psychic cold-reading techniques, debating whether these models exhibit true intelligence or merely a convincing illusion. Key themes emerge:

1. **Illusion vs. Reality of Intelligence**  
   - Participants compare LLMs to psychics, arguing both use statistical patterns and vague, validated statements to create a false sense of specificity. One user notes that LLMs, like psychics, rely on "self-selecting audiences" prone to anthropomorphizing outputs.  
   - The "Eliza effect" is highlighted, where humans project intelligence onto systems through charismatic interactions (e.g., a Santa Claus-themed program charming children).

2. **Mechanics of LLMs**  
   - LLMs are framed as *stochastic parrots* that mimic reasoning via statistical pattern-matching, not true understanding. For example, generating grammatically correct sentences doesn’t equate to comprehension.  
   - Critics argue that RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) may inadvertently train models to produce confident, appealing answers rather than truthful ones, mirroring psychics offering "comforting news" to clients.

3. **Defining Intelligence**  
   - Debate arises over *intelligence* as a concept: some define it narrowly (problem-solving ability), while others emphasize consciousness, awareness, or collective/biological intelligence. AI researchers are accused of prioritizing "usefulness" over philosophical rigor.  
   - A divide exists between those viewing intelligence as *information processing* (applied even to plants or cells) and those insisting on human-like reasoning and consciousness.

4. **Practical Utility vs. Hype**  
   - Some assert LLMs’ value lies in utility regardless of "thinking" capability. Others warn of overinvestment based on inflated expectations, likening it to the 2000s dot-com bubble.  
   - Skeptics highlight limitations: LLMs fail at puzzles requiring structured reasoning, and commercially viable uses often lack transformative impact, prioritizing cost savings over innovation.

5. **Criticism of Research Narratives**  
   - Critics accuse AI researchers of vague definitions and PR-driven narratives, dismissing interdisciplinary insights (e.g., cognitive science). One user laments that discussions about intelligence often devolve into abstract, unproductive debates.

**Conclusion**  
The thread reflects a mix of skepticism and cautious optimism. While LLMs’ practical applications are acknowledged, participants stress the need for clearer frameworks to distinguish statistical pattern-matching from genuine reasoning. The parallel to psychic trickery underscores broader concerns about anthropomorphism and commercialization in AI discourse.

### Conclusion:  
The discussion reflects a blend of technical criticism (detection challenges, terminology misuse) and broader existential concerns about AI’s societal role. While some find the tool novel, skepticism dominates, particularly around Mozilla’s priorities and the feasibility of reliably detecting ever-evolving AI-generated content.

### Value-Based Deep RL Scales Predictably

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04327) | 66 points | by [bearseascape](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bearseascape) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979846)

In an intriguing new paper on arXiv, researchers Oleh Rybkin, Michal Nauman, Preston Fu, Charlie Snell, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, and Aviral Kumar explore an essential aspect of machine learning—scaling predictability—in value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditionally, the machine learning community has viewed scaling RL as notoriously unpredictable. However, this team shows that it's more straightforward than previously thought when dealt with the right approach.

The research breaks down the scaling process into three key findings. Firstly, the team discovered that the relationship between data and compute demands for achieving specific performance levels forms a Pareto frontier. They identified a crucial metric called the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio that influences this frontier. Understanding this helps in predicting the data requirements given more compute, and vice versa.

Secondly, the researchers devised a strategy for optimal resource allocation. For any given performance target, they outlined how best to distribute resources across data and compute to maximize output. This leads to selecting hyperparameters that best utilize the given budget.

Thirdly, they addressed concerns unique to RL, such as overfitting and plasticity loss, by estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters. This insight allowed them to manage and optimize these effects, assisting in achieving more consistent scaling behavior.

Their comprehensive examination of three RL algorithms (SAC, BRO, and PQL) across platforms like DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym underlines the validity of their approach. Their methodology offers a promising direction for scaling RL systems predictably, making large-scale experiments more manageable and less guesswork-intensive. This breakthrough stands to simplify previously challenging aspects of machine learning, paving the way for more robust and scalable AI applications.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**  
1. **Comparison to Prior Work**: A user references a YouTube video (unlinked) highlighting historical discussions on compute vs. data scaling, suggesting potential parallels or contrasts to the paper's findings. They also commend the paper for "rediscovering fundamental theorems," implying the work integrates key ideas for predictable scaling.  

2. **Scalability Questions**: A commenter questions how scalable value-based off-policy RL (like SAC) truly is in practice, contrasting it with policy-based methods. They raise concerns about whether the approach’s reliance on recorded data (rather than actively exploring environments) might limit scalability.  

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity & Optimism**: A third user acknowledges RL’s notorious finickiness with hyperparameters, making research stressful, but praises the paper for enabling concrete predictions about training settings. They express excitement that this work could simplify RL training, leading to more reliable "recipes" and expanding research accessibility.  

**Overall Tone**: The discussion reflects guarded optimism—applauding efforts to systematize RL scaling while flagging practical hurdles (scalability nuances, hyperparameter tuning). The paper is seen as a step toward demystifying RL experimentation.

### Bolt: Bootstrap long chain-of-thought in LLMs without distillation [pdf]

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03860) | 13 points | by [TaurenHunter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TaurenHunter) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979901)

In an exciting advancement in the world of language models, a new study titled "BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without Distillation" by Bo Pang and colleagues presents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike earlier methods that heavily relied on distillation from existing models—like OpenAI's o1—BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought) introduces a novel strategy to achieve superior reasoning without costly reliance on models or intensive human input.

The BOLT method is remarkable not just for its innovative approach but also for its simplicity. It requires only a few in-context learning examples, as evidenced by their experiment with just 10 examples. The process involves three key stages: bootstrapping LongCoT data using in-context learning on a standard instruct model, LongCoT supervised finetuning, and continued online training for refinement. The team employed the Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model, successfully scaling their strategy across various model sizes.

The study yielded impressive outcomes across multiple benchmarks, including Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, and MATH500, showcasing BOLT's ability to enhance reasoning in diverse tasks beyond the traditional focus areas such as math and coding. This research not only opens new avenues for the development of LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities but also underscores the potential for simplified, scalable methods in deploying complex AI functionalities.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around clarifying the concept of model **distillation** and challenging claims that methods like BOLT (or other models such as DeepSeek) fully avoid distillation from existing LLMs (e.g., OpenAI). Key points:  

1. **Distillation Definition**:  
   - Distillation typically transfers knowledge from a larger "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model by training the student to mimic the teacher's token probability distributions or outputs.  
   - This requires aligned tokenization schemes and training data from the teacher.  

2. **Debates Over Terminology**:  
   - Some argue that fine-tuning smaller models on outputs from larger models (even with limited data) could still be considered distillation, albeit simplified.  
   - Critics (e.g., user **krtp**) distinguish true distillation (optimizing KL divergence between teacher/student distributions) from standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which lacks alignment with the teacher’s token-level distributions.  

3. **BOLT’s Claims vs. Reality**:  
   - Comments suggest DeepSeek and similar models likely used distillation (or analogous techniques), contradicting assertions of "no distillation."  
   - The BOLT paper’s reliance on in-context examples for bootstrapping might still align with lightweight distillation-like processes.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - User **nckthgrk** notes distillation often requires millions of examples depending on model size, raising questions about whether BOLT’s 10-example approach fully captures general reasoning capabilities.  

**Key Takeaway**: The debate highlights ambiguity around defining "distillation," with skeptics arguing many methods (including BOLT) implicitly rely on knowledge transfer akin to distillation’s principles. Broader implications for LLM advancement depend on clearer definitions and ethical transparency.

### Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation (2019)

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) | 162 points | by [tehnub](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tehnub) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976698)

In the digital age, manual, repetitive tasks, or "slogs" as they’re coined, can sap the productivity of operations teams. Though some teams might dream of full automation, they often stall due to the perceived all-or-nothing nature of such projects. Enter the notion of "do-nothing scripting," a clever strategy to ease these mundane processes into the realm of automation bit by bit.

The concept of do-nothing scripting involves creating a script that maps out a cumbersome manual task, like provisioning user accounts, as discrete, manageable steps. Each step is encapsulated in a function—a simple script that prompts the user to perform each part of the task manually. While it doesn’t automate the process immediately, it creates an organized pathway toward eventual automation, ensuring no steps are misplaced or forgotten.

The real charm lies in its progressiveness: each step becomes a candidate for future automation. Over time, this incremental approach can build a robust library of automation scripts, minimizing toil gradually rather than in one monumental leap. The method transforms frustrating slogs into structured procedural flows, lowering the threshold for automation initiatives and making it easier for teams to focus their energies on more rewarding challenges.

Ultimately, do-nothing scripting shines as a strategic bridge between manual burden and automated efficiency, helping teams nudge their operating procedures from a time-consuming slog to an efficient sprint.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion on "do-nothing scripting" highlights its value as a low-effort gateway to automation, though with nuanced critiques and extensions. Key points include:  

1. **Incremental Adoption**: Commenters praised the approach for reducing the cognitive load of tackling manual processes. Scripting discrete steps (e.g., Jira workflows, SSH key provisioning) creates a clear roadmap for future automation while providing immediate documentation.  

2. **Tool Comparisons**: Some favored command-line scripts for transparency and repeatability over GUI tools. Others suggested Jupyter notebooks or Ansible playbooks as alternatives for structured workflows.  

3. **Critiques**: Criticisms centered on potential overhead (e.g., unnecessary scripts for tasks already solvable via tools like `github-keygen`) and security risks (e.g., blindly generating SSH keys via AI-generated scripts without human oversight).  

4. **Broader Insights**:  
   - **Documentation**: Scripts act as living checklists, aiding onboarding and process accountability.  
   - **GUIs as Bottlenecks**: Several users lamented the brittleness of automating GUI-driven tasks versus CLI-native workflows.  
   - **AI Integration**: An example of using ChatGPT to generate "do-nothing" steps raised debates about balancing automation speed with security best practices.  

5. **Related Work**: Links to prior discussions (3+ years old) show lasting interest in minimal automation strategies, alongside tools like Fabric and POSSE-inspired scripts.  

Ultimately, the method is seen as a pragmatic bridge from manual to automated work, though success hinges on avoiding over-engineering and prioritizing critical steps.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jeprinz/pantograph/blob/main/README.md) | 68 points | by [rybla](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rybla) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42975171)

In today's tech buzz, Hacker News is spotlighting Pantograph, a cutting-edge structure editor crafted by Jacob Prinz and Henry Blanchette. This intriguing tool, detailed in the POPL 2025 paper titled "Pantograph: A Fluid and Typed Structure Editor", is designed for more intuitive programming by operating directly on a typed syntax tree.

Traditional editors parse text before checking types, but Pantograph flips the script by allowing users to fill 'typed holes' within a syntax tree. This lets programmers manipulate complex expressions like lists with ease, simplifying edits that previously required arduous reconfigurations. A key feature is its 'tree selection' or 'zipper editing', which enhances typical structure editing by maintaining program grammars and, ideally, their types.

Pantograph also takes well-typed programming a step further by introducing a grammar of type diffs to handle how edits alter program types. It offers some automated fixes for type errors, yet wisely allows users to address certain issues later to preserve potentially useful code fragments.

This innovative system is poised to simplify functional programming and is now available for users to explore online. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, Pantograph offers an exciting new approach to writing and editing code efficiently. For those eager to dive deeper into its functionalities or contribute to its development, the project's code is open-source and available for exploration on GitHub.

### The Age of Agent Experience

#### [Submission URL](https://stytch.com/blog/the-age-of-agent-experience/) | 98 points | by [bobfunk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bobfunk) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974429)

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI agents like ChatGPT Operator and coding tools such as Devin are revolutionizing user interaction with apps by autonomously navigating interfaces, executing tasks, and making requests on users' behalf. This shift necessitates a new focus on designing the "Agent Experience" (AX), where autonomous agents become a primary audience requiring secure, transparent, and efficient handling of data and actions.

Julianna Lamb emphasizes the growing importance of AX alongside traditional User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). Just like UX reshaped how humans interface with technology and DX prioritized developer tools and APIs, AX addresses the needs of AI agents that increasingly perform tasks autonomously. This change is propelled by agents' enhanced capabilities due to advancements in large language models and multi-modal inputs, which imbue them with "agency" – the power to initiate actions and manage tasks independently.

To harness AI agents effectively, businesses must ensure robust systems for agent authentication and authorization, with OAuth being a powerful ally in this regard. OAuth allows secure, delegated access without sharing passwords, using access tokens, and defining specific scopes. This facilitates secure user consent and streamlined agent operations, which are paramount as agents take on more roles traditionally handled by users.

The shift towards AX requires investing in clean, well-defined APIs that provide agents with reliable access to the necessary functionalities. Easy onboarding, minimal friction, and efficient operations are key to maximizing both agent productivity and user satisfaction. In certain cases, such as high-stakes transactions, step-up authentication should be employed to ensure human oversight over crucial actions.

As agents increasingly handle product or platform interactions, companies offering open ecosystems with easy onboarding, open APIs, and secure authentication are set to excel, outpacing closed, vertically integrated systems. By ensuring a quality agent experience, businesses not only support AI-driven agents but enhance their overall offering for human users, driving wider adoption and satisfaction.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the challenges and opportunities in designing for AI agents (Agent Experience or AX) as they interact with systems on users' behalf. Key themes include:  

1. **Authentication & Security**:  
   - **OAuth** is highlighted as a critical tool for secure agent authentication, enabling delegated access without password sharing. Users emphasize its role in tracking agent actions and revoking access if agents misbehave.  
   - **Step-up authentication** (e.g., requiring human approval for sensitive transactions) and **hardware-based security** (physical tokens, USB keys) are proposed for high-stakes actions, though some criticize these as cumbersome.  

2. **CAPTCHA Challenges**:  
   - Traditional CAPTCHAs are seen as ineffective against AI agents, which can solve them cheaply. Alternatives like behavioral analysis (e.g., mouse movement patterns, network signals) or phone-based verification are debated.  

3. **APIs vs. Screen-Scraping**:  
   - Participants advocate for **robust APIs** over screen-scraping, which is brittle and error-prone. Examples like Plaid’s transition from screen-scraping to OAuth in fintech illustrate this shift.  
   - Some argue UIs designed for humans force agents to rely on unreliable methods, leading to calls for standardized, agent-friendly APIs.  

4. **Economic Incentives & Ecosystems**:  
   - Open platforms with **agent-friendly APIs** are predicted to outperform closed systems. Amazon’s dominance is cited as a cautionary example, where prioritizing sales over UX leads to competitive challenges.  
   - Concerns about brands losing control in open ecosystems are balanced against the inevitability of agents reshaping markets.  

5. **Technical Hurdles**:  
   - Developers note the difficulty of creating agents that navigate human-centric UIs, citing Firefox extensions using LLMs that break when websites change.  
   - Proposals include **HATEOAS** (hypermedia APIs) for agent navigation and behavioral heuristics (e.g., timing, deterministic signals) to distinguish agents from humans.  

6. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - Some users question whether OAuth truly meets agent needs yet, pointing to evolving standards. Others joke about agents "working in corporate factories" or replacing humans entirely.  

**Takeaway**: The shift to AX requires rethinking authentication, API design, and security, with OAuth and open ecosystems poised to play central roles. However, technical and economic challenges persist, particularly in balancing automation with human oversight and adapting legacy systems for agents. The discussion reflects both optimism for AI-driven efficiency and skepticism about implementation hurdles.

### Robust autonomy emerges from self-play

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03349) | 134 points | by [reqo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reqo) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42968700)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers have demonstrated a novel application of self-play, a concept previously known for its role in training AI to excel at games like chess and Go. However, this time, self-play has been leveraged to tackle the complexities of autonomous driving. The team has managed to create an AI driving system that learns and perfects its driving behavior solely through self-play within a simulated environment.

### The New York Times Has Spent $10.8M in Its Legal Battle with OpenAI So Far

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/) | 81 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952306)

In a tug-of-war over the future of media content, some major publishers have opted to embrace AI, pocketing substantial payouts from OpenAI in exchange for allowing their content to fuel ChatGPT and similar technologies. This approach seems to offer a steady revenue stream as traditional internet advertising faces uncertainty. For instance, Dotdash Meredith reported an annual intake of $16 million from such a licensing deal, while News Corp has touted its agreement with OpenAI as transformative.

However, The New York Times has taken a defiant path, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using its content without permission, arguing for compensation to the tune of billions for what they see as unlawful actions. This legal crusade has cost The Times a hefty $10.8 million in AI-related litigation expenses for 2024. Standing firm on their principles, The Times is positioned as one of the few publishers robust enough, buoyed by over 11 million subscribers, to confront tech titans in court.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has publicly disagreed with The Times’ severe stance, suggesting that their legal approach could place them on "the wrong side of history." As the tussle continues, it highlights a broader industry dilemma: how to balance the potential tech benefits with fair compensation for original content creators. Meanwhile, industry giants including Vogue's parent Condé Nast, Time magazine, and others have still chosen licensing agreements, which are designed for mutual benefit, albeit with renegotiation options in the near future.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legal and ethical implications of OpenAI using copyrighted content, particularly highlighted by *The New York Times* (NYT) lawsuit. Key arguments and themes include:

1. **Verbatim Reproduction & Copyright Infringement**:  
   - Participants debate whether ChatGPT’s ability to reproduce NYT articles verbatim—even with extensive "prompt engineering"—constitutes copyright violation. Examples cited include OpenAI’s use of 10,000 prompts to generate near-identical copies of NYT content, which critics argue demonstrates intentional infringement.  
   - **Counterarguments** suggest OpenAI’s model, like mathematical sequences (e.g., generating Pi digits), isn’t inherently infringing unless outputs directly replicate copyrighted works. However, others insist *exact reproductions*, even via tokenized data, violate copyright law regardless of technical methods.

2. **Technical vs. Legal Interpretations**:  
   - Disagreements arise over whether AI-generated outputs using tokenized training data are equivalent to direct copying. Some argue copyright law cares only about the end result (exact reproductions), not the process, while others claim algorithms transforming data into new outputs are distinct from traditional infringement.  
   - Analogies like sharing a Marvel movie via BitTorrent (clearly illegal) versus AI indirectly reconstructing content highlight tensions between intent and technical execution.

3. **Corporate Power Dynamics**:  
   - Critics argue corporations like OpenAI exploit copyrighted material at scale, contrasting with individual creators who face harsher scrutiny. The framing pits “production” (corporations monetizing AI) against “consumption” (individuals sharing content), with concerns that the legal system favors entities with resources.  
   - OpenAI’s dismissive stance toward NYT’s claims is seen as emblematic of tech giants undermining content creators’ rights.

4. **OpenAI’s Defense & Legal Strategy**:  
   - OpenAI’s argument that training on publicly available data is legitimate faces skepticism. Critics liken it to “IP laundering,” where copyrighted content is obscured through AI processes. Others question if prompt-based outputs absolve liability, especially when users deliberately extract paywalled articles.  
   - The NYT’s lawsuit hinges on proving OpenAI’s models were designed to replicate proprietary content, with evidence of systematic verbatim outputs strengthening their case.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores unresolved tensions between AI innovation and copyright enforcement, with participants split on whether existing laws adequately address AI’s unique challenges. While technical nuances complicate legal judgments, the NYT’s case highlights growing scrutiny over AI’s reliance on uncompensated copyrighted material.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-research-suggests-huaweis-ascend-910c-delivers-60-percent-nvidia-h100-inference-performance) | 115 points | by [sien](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sien) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42943906)

Amidst the ongoing semiconductor race, Huawei has upped its ante by unveiling the HiSilicon Ascend 910C, a revamped version of the Ascend 910 AI processor. Despite trailing behind Nvidia's H100 in raw performance, the 910C aims to reduce China's reliance on American GPUs and asserts an interesting value proposition in AI inference tasks, delivering about 60% of the performance of Nvidia's market-leading offering. 

DeepSeek's research reveals that with minor kernel optimizations, the 910C could significantly exceed expectations in inference performance, hinting at Huawei's evolving capabilities despite facing U.S. sanctions and limited TSMC process tech access. Through DeepSeek's PyTorch repository, engineers can transition from CUDA to CUNN with less hassle, facilitating Huawei's processor integration into existing AI workflows.

Though China still struggles in the training reliability sphere—where Nvidia leads due to its longstanding hardware-software ecosystem integration—the Ascend 910C showcases promise as a competitive option. However, experts argue that Huawei's infrastructure needs refinement to stand firm on a global footing, especially in the wake of more complex Transformer architectures in AI models.

In the bigger picture, Huawei and SMIC have progressed to match capabilities dating back to TSMC's 2019–2020 offerings. This iteration of Huawei's AI chip utilizes SMIC’s 2nd Generation 7nm-class N+2 process, invoking a sense of catching up despite lagging behind cutting-edge tech. As the scene unfolds, many eyes remain on whether Huawei can challenge Nvidia's AI training dominance while sustaining inroads made in the inference landscape.

### Summary of Discussion:  
The Hacker News discussion about Huawei’s Ascend 910C AI chip and China’s semiconductor progress revolves around **technical challenges**, **geopolitical dynamics**, and **commercial viability debates**:

#### **1. Technical Challenges and SMIC’s Progress**  
- **Yield Comparisons**: SMIC’s 7nm-class (N+2) process reportedly achieves ~20% yields for the Ascend 910C, significantly lower than TSMC’s mature 7nm yields (~90% for Huawei’s Kirin 9000S phone chips). Skeptics argue larger chip sizes (e.g., 665mm2 for Ascend 910C vs. ~100mm2 for Kirin) severely impact yields, raising cost concerns.  
- **Design Improvements**: The 910C is noted as a redesign ("chiplet" packaging) of the 910B (previously made by TSMC), suggesting iterative progress. However, critics highlight Huawei/SMIC still rely on older DUV lithography tools like ASML’s NXT:2000i, lagging behind cutting-edge EUV tech.  

#### **2. Geopolitical Tensions and Taiwan**  
- **Taiwan’s Silicon Shield**: Users debate whether China’s semiconductor ambitions are tied to reunification with Taiwan. Some argue China aims to “make TSMC irrelevant” by advancing domestic production (via SMIC) and reducing reliance on Taiwanese/Western tech. Others counter that TSMC’s fabs would be destroyed in a conflict, leaving China dependent on U.S.-allied ASML tools regardless.  
- **Sanctions and Decoupling**: U.S. export controls on high-end GPUs (e.g., H100) and equipment (ASML EUV) force China to prioritize self-reliance. However, skeptics note China’s AI chips still trail in efficiency and scale, relying on subsidies and state-backed cloud projects.  

#### **3. Commercial Viability and Energy Costs**  
- **Subsidies vs. Market Realities**: Critics argue Huawei’s chips (and phones) survive due to heavy government subsidies and “political pricing,” not true commercial competitiveness. Others counter that China’s cheaper electricity (vs. Europe/U.S.) could offset power-hungry AI chips like the 910C.  
- **Nvidia’s Dominance**: Nvidia’s H100 (costing $3k to produce, sold at $25k) exemplifies Western pricing power. China struggles to match this due to sanctions, design limitations, and software ecosystem gaps (e.g., CUDA’s dominance).  

#### **4. Broader Implications**  
- **Global Supply Chains**: A hypothetical China-Taiwan conflict would disrupt chip supplies, but Taiwan’s “Silicon Shield” is seen as weakening as SMIC advances and the West reshores production (e.g., TSMC Arizona).  
- **AGI and Governance**: Some warn China’s centralized governance risks misaligned AI development, though others dismiss this as Western bias.  

**TL;DR**: Huawei/SMIC’s Ascend 910C shows incremental progress in AI inference but faces yield, efficiency, and ecosystem hurdles. Geopolitically, China’s chip push is intertwined with Taiwan tensions and tech decoupling, though doubts persist about sustainability without subsidies or cutting-edge tools. Nvidia’s software/hardware dominance remains unmatched.

Meta's latest tool, Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH), is revolutionizing the landscape of software testing and security. This innovative system leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of mutation-guided test generation, specifically targeting undetected faults (mutants) within source code. ACH excels where traditional methods fall short by focusing on actual faults rather than simply increasing code coverage. It transforms vague descriptions of potential bugs into a powerful suite of tests, automatically generating both realistic faults and the tests to catch them.

At its core, ACH carries out three pivotal steps: engineers describe the bugs they are concerned about, ACH automatically generates a multitude of bugs, and finally, it creates tests to specifically catch these threats. This process not only enhances code resilience against regressions but does so efficiently and effectively, saving precious human labor.

Meta has already applied ACH to several platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and found it particularly useful for strengthening code against specific concerns. The tool is adaptable to any class of faults, promising to modernize automated test generation and help engineers derive actionable insights from diverse informational sources.

The significance of ACH lies not just in its technical innovation but also in its potential to simplify risk assessments, lighten cognitive burdens for developers, and bolster overall online safety. Future plans include expanding the deployment of ACH, seeking industry-wide adoption, and further advancing the system’s capabilities to optimize compliance testing. With ACH, Meta is setting a new standard for how we harden software systems against the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.

The discussion revolves around two primary threads:
