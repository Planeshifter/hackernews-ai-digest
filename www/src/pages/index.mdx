### CISA publishes 447 page draft of cyber incident reporting rule

#### [Submission URL](https://therecord.media/cisa-publishes-circia-rule-cyber-incident-reporting) | 62 points | by [anigbrowl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anigbrowl) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39954149)

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released a 447-page draft of a new rule requiring critical infrastructure organizations to report cyber incidents promptly to the federal government. This rule, known as the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), aims to enhance the government's ability to respond to incidents and improve cybersecurity across various sectors. The rule mandates reporting cyber incidents within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours for certain critical infrastructure organizations.

CISA will designate 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including manufacturing, energy, financial services, healthcare, transportation, and water utilities, to comply with the new reporting requirements. Despite concerns about the potential burden and cost of implementing the rule, CISA officials believe that the information received will help enhance cybersecurity measures and provide valuable insights to the cybersecurity community.

Some cybersecurity experts have expressed mixed feelings about the initial draft, questioning the limited scope of organizations covered by the rule. Concerns have been raised about excluding smaller companies, such as hospitals and medical device firms, from the reporting requirements, potentially leading to incomplete data and increased risks. Suggestions have been made to streamline reporting obligations for smaller organizations while ensuring comprehensive incident reporting.

The public will have 60 days to comment on the rule before it is officially published on April 4, with CISA planning to make revisions over the next 18 months. Despite challenges and criticisms, the implementation of CIRCIA is seen as a significant step towards improving cybersecurity preparedness and response in critical infrastructure sectors.

### AI eye-tracking to determine whether child has autism

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/06/deal-dive-earlitec-diagnostics-raises-21-5m-to-help-diagnose-autism-earlier/) | 15 points | by [jasontlouro](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasontlouro) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39953861)

EarliTec Diagnostics, a startup based in Atlanta, just secured $21.5 million in a Series B round to further develop its system for diagnosing autism in children as young as 16 months old. Their innovative approach involves using AI to track a child's eye movements while watching short videos and social interactions on a screen. By analyzing how a child focuses on the video, the system can provide valuable insights for clinicians. This 12-minute test aims to streamline the diagnostic process, leading to faster outcomes for children and parents.

CEO Tom Ressemann emphasized the significance of early diagnosis and the positive impact it can have on a child's developmental journey. The company's flexible testing method allows it to integrate smoothly into existing workflows, whether in the child's home, at a clinic, or at school. With the fresh capital, EarliTec plans to expand its commercialization efforts and potentially broaden the age range of children its system can diagnose, while also improving assessment and treatment options.

The funding landscape for autism-related startups is evolving, with growing interest from venture capitalists in the healthcare space focusing on neurodiversity. Recent developments, such as the closing of a $60 million fund by the Autism Impact Fund, highlight a shift towards investing in solutions that support individuals with autism. Ressemann notes the importance of increased awareness regarding the prevalence of autism in driving investor interest. The expanding market for solutions addressing developmental delays underscores the potential for financial returns while making a positive impact on children's lives.

Overall, the intersection of technology, healthcare, and neurodiversity presents a promising avenue for startups like EarliTec to thrive and make a meaningful difference in the lives of those affected by autism.
