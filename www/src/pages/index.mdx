### Artificial spider gland spins scalable spider silk just like nature

#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/materials/artificial-gland-spins-spider-silk-rapidly-repeatedly/) | 24 points | by [wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39119655)

Scientists have successfully spun artificial spider silk using an artificial gland that mimics the natural process of spider silk production. Researchers from Japan's RIKEN Center for Sustainable Resource Science and the RIKEN Cluster for Pioneering Research constructed an artificial silk gland designed to replicate the physical and chemical changes that occur in a spider's gland. The artificial gland required precise microfluidic mechanisms to self-assemble proteins into silk fibers that behave like natural spider silk. The breakthrough has the potential to revolutionize the textiles industry and have diverse medical applications, such as sutures and artificial ligaments. The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.

The discussion on this submission on Hacker News includes a few comments that seem unrelated to the topic. One user, "krnck," mentions that they cannot write a "cvng" (assuming they meant "covering") of 100 meters in "rp" (possibly "rope") that weighs 2kg. Another user, "thr," comments about a "flying cr wk" (possibly referring to a flying car work) without providing further context. Lastly, a user named "gnmn" asks for a specific type of material, mentioning "silk pc plstc" (possibly referring to silk-like plastic). These comments appear to be off-topic and unrelated to the artificial spider silk discussed in the submission.
