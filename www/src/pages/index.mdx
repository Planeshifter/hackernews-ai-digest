Google is making waves in the search engine realm by diving headfirst into AI. Their latest update, dubbed "AI Overviews," is set to revolutionize the search experience for billions of users worldwide. Spearheaded by Google's new head of Search, Liz Reid, this shift towards AI-driven search aims to streamline the searching process, allowing users to focus on what matters most to them.

This overhaul isn't just about generating summaries; it's a comprehensive AI transformation that touches every aspect of the search process. From automatic categorization to personalized trip itineraries, Google's AI is taking the wheel to enhance user experience. With features like Lens search through video capture and intelligent result organization, Google is setting a new standard for search engines.

While not every search query will trigger these advanced AI capabilities, Google aims to assist users in more complex situations where traditional search methods fall short. By leveraging their Gemini AI model to combine the Knowledge Graph with web data, Google strives to deliver accurate and insightful answers to even the most specific queries.

By prioritizing factual accuracy over creativity, Google hopes to provide users with reliable information through AI Overviews. Despite potential challenges like false information, Google remains committed to directing users to high-quality content on the open web. This evolution in search reflects Google's ongoing efforts to adapt to changing user needs and preferences while maintaining a focus on delivering a human touch to search results.

As Google continues to push the boundaries of search with AI, users can expect a more intuitive and personalized search experience that caters to their diverse needs and preferences.

The discussion on Hacker News covers various aspects related to Google's AI-driven search updates and the implications they might have. Users express concerns about the impact of AI-generated search results, with some worrying about Google AI favoring websites with HowTo content and potential traffic loss for other websites. The conversation delves into the financial implications of Google's AI advancements, including discussions about AdWords, AdSense, and the challenges faced by content creators relying on AI-generated reviews. There are also discussions about the cost of energy consumption for AI search engines and the debate around the quality of results and indexing. Some users point out frustrations with specific search queries and issues with search engine optimization in the context of AI-driven search results. The conversation also touches on the accuracy and necessity of double-checking information found through search engines and the potential shift towards AI-generated search results. Overall, the users are engaging in a critical examination of the evolving landscape of search engines in the age of AI.

### Current AI models are more creative than humans on divergent thinking tasks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10858891/) | 14 points | by [amichail](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amichail) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40359920)

The top story on Hacker News today discusses a recent study that compared the creative potential of humans to that of artificial intelligence (AI) generative language models. The study found that AI, specifically GPT-4, was significantly more creative than human participants in divergent thinking tasks. This suggests that current AI models demonstrate a higher level of creative potential than humans when it comes to generating original and elaborate responses. The emergence of AI models like GPT has sparked conversations about the capabilities and limitations of AI in various domains, including creativity. Researchers are delving into the implications of AI on tasks that require creative thinking and problem-solving, challenging the traditional notion that creativity is a uniquely human trait.

The discussion on the Hacker News thread regarding the top story about a study comparing the creative potential of humans and AI brings up different perspectives. One user, "mistrial9", points out that a recent white paper solved a technical non-confidence debate by stating that General Artificial Intelligence (GAI) handles fifty percent of human tasks, such as color desk jobs, and fifty percent of the tasks are blindness, making a declaration of futility. Another user, "Nasrudith", highlights that human creativity is narrowly defined, and Mechanical Turk work is suggested to be surpassed by AI, pointing out that the AI substitutes lack of true intent much like outsourced cheap labor. However, the user notes that in a general sense, human creativity is still applicable. Additionally, "Terr_" comments that machines might appear creative to humans, but the intrinsically motivated nature of human creativity tasks remains.

On another note, "jrssn" mentions how current random number generators are used for creative tasks related to number-picking. Another user, "Log_out_", emphasizes that generations of mission failure in divergent thinkers are slowing down the genetic science culture, suggesting that AI is finally beginning to fill the gap. The user concludes by noting the necessity of removing the filtered human breakthroughs to drive real innovation.
