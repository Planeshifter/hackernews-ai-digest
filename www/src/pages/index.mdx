### Building Document-Centric, CRDT-Native Editors

#### [Submission URL](https://blocksuite.io/blog/document-centric.html) | 64 points | by [rapnie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rapnie) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41923693)

Yifeng Wang explores the design limitations of traditional editor frameworks and introduces an innovative document-centric approach for collaborative editing. While popular frameworks like React and Vue emphasize component-based development, Wang argues that this methodology can hinder cross-editor integration and state management, particularly for complex applications requiring rich text and media editing.

After encountering frustrations with existing editors during their quest to enhance a collaborative knowledge base product, the team experimented with existing solutions but found them inadequate. This prompted a reevaluation of their architecture, leading to the adoption of a document-centric model powered by Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs). 

This new approach decouples document data from the editor instances, allowing for seamless sharing of document states across multiple editors, simplifying user operation history tracking, and enhancing flexibility in how documents can be managed. This shift not only addresses technical challenges but also promises a more scalable and immersive editing experience akin to a blend between Google Docs and Figma.

Wang posits that embracing this document-centric philosophy can revolutionize the way collaborative editing is approached, paving the way for more unified and efficient user experiences.

In the Hacker News discussion about Yifeng Wang's article on building document-centric, CRDT-native editors, participants share various opinions and insights about the advantages and challenges of implementing Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) in collaborative editing environments.
