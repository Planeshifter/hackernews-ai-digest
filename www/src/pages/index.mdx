### Hand Tracking for Mouse Input (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://chernando.com/blog/2023/07/23/hand-tracking-for-mouse-input.html) | 203 points | by [wonger_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wonger_) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42185842)

In an exciting exploration of intuitive technology, a tech enthusiast has embarked on a project to replicate Apple Vision Pro's innovative finger input functionality using a combination of MediaPipe and Python. The project aims to transform hand gestures, specifically finger pinching, into mouse controls for computer use, creating a hands-free experience.

Starting off with the MediaPipe library—known for its pre-built machine learning solutions—he faced initial challenges with lag when using the Python version alongside OpenCV. After troubleshooting and identifying performance issues, he pivoted to the smoother web version of MediaPipe, devising a unique approach to transmit hand movements from a browser to a Python backend using a WebSocket server.

The setup involves the use of finger landmarks to control the mouse cursor based on the thumb tip's position. Detection of pinching gestures further simulates mouse clicks essential for clicking and dragging actions. However, this brought up challenges in measuring distances accurately with varying hand positions relative to the camera, which he ingeniously solved by calculating "relative distances" between finger tips and their respective knuckles.

Despite achieving reasonable functionality, the project was not without hiccups. Jittering issues—caused by the natural movement of the hand tracker—prompted him to implement a moving average to smooth out cursor movement. Additionally, he addressed usability by creating a safe zone at the edges of the screen to enhance interaction without requiring extreme hand movements.

Overall, the endeavor reflects a growing interest in gesture-based technology and a creative spirit determined to innovate despite technical setbacks. The project not only demonstrates ingenuity in solving practical issues but also opens up fascinating possibilities for future developments in human-computer interaction.

In the discussions surrounding the submission on Hacker News, users shared their experiences and insights related to the project replicating Apple Vision Pro's finger input functionality. 

Many commenters noted that transitioning from the Python to a JavaScript version of the implementation improved performance, particularly with OpenCV, which is known for its lag issues in Python. Some expressed satisfaction with achieving a working JavaScript version and recognized the complicated nature of using machine learning libraries across different programming languages.

The conversation shifted towards technical aspects of implementing filters to smooth cursor movement, with suggestions of alternative filtering methods, such as IIR filters, to reduce noise and improve response time. Users recommended various approaches for effectively handling hand tracking, and noted challenges like jitter caused by natural hand movements.

Additionally, some commenters referenced related projects like "Project Gameface," which aim to enhance user interaction with computing systems using hand-tracking technology. There was discussion about the potential for these projects to alleviate repetitive strain injuries by allowing hands-free control.

Overall, the dialogue highlighted a mix of technical challenges, project suggestions, and a shared enthusiasm for gesture-based technology innovations. Users encouraged further exploration and development in this field, exchanging tips on improving performance and usability in gesture-based interfaces.

### You could have designed state of the art positional encoding

#### [Submission URL](https://fleetwood.dev/posts/you-could-have-designed-SOTA-positional-encoding) | 182 points | by [Philpax](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Philpax) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166948)

In a recent deep dive into the evolution of positional encoding for transformer models, a fascinating exploration on improving self-attention mechanisms was shared. The post guides readers through the iterative discovery of Rotary Positional Encoding (RoPE), a significant enhancement featured in the latest LLama 3.2 release, by breaking down the requirements and methodologies in an accessible way.

The challenge stems from the inherent permutation invariance of self-attention: without positional information, identical tokens in different contexts, such as "dog" in "The dog chased another dog," yield indistinguishable outputs. To tackle this, the author outlines desirable properties for an effective positional encoding scheme: unique encodings for every position, linear relationships between positions for intuitive learning, adaptability to variable sequence lengths, a deterministic generation process, and extensibility to multidimensional data.

Starting with a preliminary method of integer position encoding, the article critiques the shortcomings of naïve approaches—like exceeding the semantic signal with position values—while guiding readers through the complexities of implementing a successful encoding strategy. This exploration serves not only as an insightful analysis of RoPE but also as a reminder of the intricate dance between simplicity and complexity in building effective AI models.

### AI-generated poetry is indistinguishable from human-written and more favorably

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-76900-1) | 14 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42166405)

A recent study reveals that AI-generated poetry has reached an impressive level of sophistication, making it virtually indistinguishable from human-written works, at least for non-expert readers. In experiments involving over 16,000 participants, results showed that people scored only 46.6% accuracy in identifying the authorship of poems, often mistaking AI-generated pieces for those penned by renowned poets. Interestingly, these AI poems were rated more favorably in terms of rhythm and beauty, suggesting that their relative simplicity might make them more appealing to the average reader. This trend highlights a common bias, where non-experts misinterpret the complexity of human poetry as incoherence, believing instead that the more straightforward AI poems are of human origin. While previous studies showed a bias against recognizing AI art, this new research flips the narrative, suggesting that AI-generated poetry could be seen as "more human than human." However, once participants knew a poem was AI-generated, their ratings dropped significantly, confirming the ongoing skepticism around AI's creative capabilities.

In the discussion sparked by the study on AI-generated poetry, commenters offered varying perspectives. Some expressed skepticism about the significance of the findings, pondering the relevance of distinguishing between human and AI authorship, highlighting that the perceived quality remains subjective. Others pointed out that while AI-generated poetry was rated highly in terms of rhyme and beauty, it was often confused with works from well-known human poets, suggesting that the simplicity in AI poetry may appeal to readers unfamiliar with poetic intricacies.

A few participants emphasized that their experiences with generating poetry using AI tools had yielded results comparable to those of famous poets, noting that even blind taste tests showed favor toward AI-created works. However, there's acknowledgment of ongoing bias against AI as creative entities, especially when participants learned the poems were AI-generated, which led to lower ratings. Overall, the conversation indicated a complex relationship with AI's potential in creative fields, touching on issues of authorship, quality assessment, and the subjective nature of literary appreciation.
