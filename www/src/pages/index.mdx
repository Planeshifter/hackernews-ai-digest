### "AI will cure cancer" misunderstands both AI and medicine

#### [Submission URL](https://rachel.fast.ai/posts/2024-02-20-ai-medicine/) | 146 points | by [pratnala](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pratnala) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39582541)

In the world of AI and healthcare, remarkable strides have been made, from detecting Parkinson's disease through retinal images to predicting hospital readmissions. However, there are concerns about the practical impact these advancements will have on patients. A recent late-night debate highlighted the conflicting views on AI safety, with one optimistic statement standing out: "AI will cure cancer." While this optimism is widespread, there are reservations about the true implications for healthcare.

Two core issues surrounding AI in medicine are the disregard for patient perspectives and the exacerbation of inequality, with claims of AI curing cancer sometimes being seen as mere marketing slogans. Automated decision-making processes powered by AI are increasingly influencing critical aspects of people's lives, such as determining job opportunities, housing access, and healthcare provision. Disturbing patterns have emerged, where errors made by AI systems can have devastating consequences for individuals, leading to hunger, unjust debts, and reduced medical care.

The use of AI in decision-making systems often prioritizes increasing revenues over ensuring fairness and accuracy, disproportionately affecting marginalized populations. This trend reflects a historical pattern of surveillance being leveraged against vulnerable groups. Automation bias, where people trust computers over humans, further complicates the situation, making it harder to identify errors in AI-driven decisions. These systems often lack mechanisms for error correction, participant involvement, and providing redress for those harmed.

Even in the medical field, advancements in AI may not address fundamental issues within the healthcare system, as seen in the personal experience of neurologist Ilene Ruhoy, who faced delays in diagnosis and treatment for a brain tumor due to skepticism from colleagues. These examples underscore the importance of not just advancing AI capabilities but also addressing systemic issues within healthcare that AI alone cannot resolve.

Discussion Summary:
- There is a debate on the practicality of AI making healthcare more proactive in cancer detection. The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of regular screenings versus targeted screenings for high-risk populations and the potential harm caused by unnecessary testing and overdiagnosis.
- The importance of understanding the various types of cancer and detecting specific cancers early is emphasized, as early detection can significantly impact treatment outcomes. There are differing opinions on whether detecting cancers early leads to better outcomes or if it leads to unnecessary treatments due to overdiagnosis.
- The discussion also touches on the potential of AI in improving the accuracy of cancer screenings by reducing false positives and negatives. However, there are concerns about the limitations of AI in interpreting variables and the need for further improvements in cancer diagnostics.
- The debate extends to the role of AI in healthcare beyond cancer detection, with some highlighting the importance of AI in accelerating treatment and drug development processes. The discussion underscores the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare but also raises questions about its practical implications and the need to address systemic issues within the healthcare system.

### Price fixing by algorithm is still price fixing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing) | 740 points | by [nabla9](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nabla9) | [486 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39575803)

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice are cracking down on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market. In a joint legal brief, they emphasized that using technology to collude on rental pricing is still illegal under antitrust laws. With rental prices soaring, landlords using algorithms to set prices may hinder competition and harm consumers. The agencies warn that agreeing to use a shared pricing algorithm is considered collusion, and deviations from suggested prices do not justify illegal behavior. This crackdown extends beyond the housing industry, with cases involving online resales and meat processing competitors. The message is clear: whether it's through algorithms or other means, price-fixing will not be tolerated.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about the crackdown on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market delves into various aspects of using software tools like YieldStar to set pricing in the rental industry. Users discuss the legality of using algorithms to set public information prices, subscription services for pricing data, implications of not following suggested pricing, and the sharing of rental control data.

### Researchers create AI worms that can spread from one system to another

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/03/researchers-create-ai-worms-that-can-spread-from-one-system-to-another/) | 40 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39575308)

Researchers have created generative AI worms that can spread through AI systems, potentially stealing data or deploying malware. These AI worms, named Morris II, were designed to attack generative AI email assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini by exploiting vulnerabilities in the systems. The worms work by tricking the AI model into generating further malicious instructions, akin to traditional computer attacks like SQL injection.
By using adversarial prompts, the researchers were able to demonstrate how the AI worm could infect an email system, steal sensitive user data, and even forward malicious messages to other clients. The potential risks posed by these generative AI worms are significant, especially as AI systems become more interconnected and autonomous in performing tasks like sending emails or making appointments.
While the research serves as a warning about vulnerabilities in AI architectures, it also highlights the importance of implementing robust security measures to safeguard against such attacks. Even though the demonstration was conducted in a controlled environment, cybersecurity experts emphasize the need for developers to take the threat of generative AI worms seriously, particularly in scenarios where AI agents are granted permissions to act on behalf of users. The implications of these AI worms could be far-reaching and may require proactive measures to mitigate potential risks.

The discussion on the submission about generative AI worms highlights various perspectives and concerns. The conversation delves into the intricacies of defending against potential AI attacks, emphasizing the need for well-defined scopes and parameters in AI models to prevent malicious behavior. Participants mention the challenges of securing AI systems, particularly when dealing with sensitive information and potential vulnerabilities. 
Furthermore, the discussion touches upon the complexities of email processing and the importance of ensuring secure communication practices. There are also references made to real-world scenarios such as the use of drones in warfare and the significance of resource allocation in cybersecurity efforts. Additionally, the conversation underscores the need for vigilance in addressing security issues and the importance of continuous monitoring and improvement in defense mechanisms against evolving threats.
