### Disney Packed Big Emotion into a Little Robot

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot) | 51 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37818009)

At the 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), a Disney Research team unveiled a new robotic character that combines animation and reinforcement learning to achieve emotive movements. The robot, developed by a team led by Moritz BÃ¤cher from Disney Research in Zurich, features a child-size body with an expressive head, wiggly antennae, and stubby legs. Disney has a long history of programming robots to exhibit emotive behaviors, but as robots become more advanced and mobile, it becomes challenging to develop motions that are both expressive and compatible with real-world constraints. The team spent a year developing a new system that leverages reinforcement learning to convert an animator's vision into robust and expressive motions that can work in different environments. The robot, which is mostly 3D printed, has a four-degree-of-freedom head and five-degree-of-freedom legs with hip joints for dynamic walking and balancing. Disney's expertise in character animation coupled with technical expertise in building mechanical systems allows them to create lifelike performances.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406) | 72 points | by [yuchiz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yuchiz) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37816614)

Researchers have introduced a new framework called Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) that aims to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown impressive performance on decision-making tasks, they often lack the ability to act as autonomous agents. LATS utilizes LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning. The framework incorporates an environment for external feedback, offering a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism. Experimental evaluation in various domains, including programming and web browsing, demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of LATS. For instance, LATS achieves a score of 94.4% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5. This research opens doors for enhancing the capabilities of language models in reasoning, acting, and planning.

The discussion on this submission begins with a request to copy the paragraph for easier reference. Another commenter points out that the abstract of the linked article contains some technical and methodological details. One user provides a high-level summary of the submission, noting that the Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) framework combines reasoning, planning, and decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs). They further explain that LATS adapts the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) approach used in AlphaZero to enable high-level planning in LLMs.

Another commenter shares a link to the associated Github repository for the project. One user mentions their attempt to implement a similar project, focusing on creating different types of agents with planned subtasks using natural language. They describe the challenges they faced in understanding the graph search and thought-contraction-reflection selection process.
