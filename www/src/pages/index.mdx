### Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16141) | 52 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38552186)

A new research paper titled "Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Exploiting Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks" has been submitted to arXiv. The authors, Shuo Chen and his colleagues, discuss the challenges of pruning deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to the binary and non-differentiable nature of spike signals. Pruning is an important technique for reducing the computational and storage requirements of SNNs, making them more suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources. However, existing pruning methods for SNNs often require high time overhead to make pruning decisions. 

To address this issue, the authors propose a regeneration mechanism based on criticality, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience. They introduce a low-cost metric for the criticality of pruning structures and rerank the pruned structures based on their criticality. By regenerating the structures with higher criticality, they are able to obtain more efficient pruned networks. The authors evaluate their method using popular deep neural network architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-19, for both unstructured and structured pruning. Their method achieves higher performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods with the same time overhead. Furthermore, they achieve comparable performances, and even better results on VGG-16, compared to the state-of-the-art methods with 11.3x and 15.5x acceleration.

The authors also investigate the underlying mechanism of their method and find that it efficiently selects potential structures, learns consistent feature representations, and reduces overfitting during the recovery phase. The paper is categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning.

Overall, this research paper presents a novel approach to efficient pruning of Spiking Neural Networks by exploiting criticality, offering promising results compared to existing methods.

The discussion on this submission includes several different points of view. Some users discuss the challenges of training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compared to traditional neural networks, emphasizing that SNNs are not differentiable and cannot use backpropagation. However, there is disagreement on this point, with one user arguing that recent work has shown it is possible to compute gradients in SNNs using backpropagation algorithms that involve spike communication. Another user suggests a technique for recording spike events in an SQL database, allowing for efficient queries and determining the contributors to specific output spikes.

There is also discussion about the feasibility of implementing SNNs on hardware and the potential benefits of event-driven architectures. A user mentions that SNN models can be run on simple CPUs but may require specialized hardware for improved performance. Another user highlights the efficiency of event-driven software and its implications for simulating networks.

In response to a comment about the gradient computation in SNNs, another user suggests using differentiable approximations for spike-based learning in order to optimize the weights of the network. They propose a principled version of injecting noise into the network, which can help in classifying patterns with different probabilities.

There is a brief exchange about the scalability of training large SNNs, with one user mentioning that they stopped using a method that involved billions of neurons for training long short-term memory (LLM) SNNs. Another user points out that current hardware may not efficiently support the constraints of SNNs.

Towards the end of the discussion, a user shares their curiosity about improving the functioning of brains, prompting another user to express interest in improved brain models, particularly in relation to memory and communication abilities.

Overall, the discussion delves into various aspects of SNNs, including training challenges, hardware implementation, noise injection, and scalability. There is also interest in understanding and improving the functioning of biological brains.
