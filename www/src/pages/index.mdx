#### [Submission URL](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-10-05/robot-vacuum-deebot-ecovacs-photos-ai/104416632) | 78 points | by [testrun](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=testrun) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41753983)

In a concerning revelation, Ecovacs, the manufacturer of popular Deebot robot vacuums, has been found to be collecting potentially sensitive data—including photos, videos, and voice recordings taken inside users' homes—to train its AI models. This data collection occurs through a "Product Improvement Program," which many users are unaware of, as the app fails to provide clear information about the extent of data being collected.

A serious cybersecurity vulnerability allows hackers to access these robot vacuums from distances of over 100 meters, raising significant privacy concerns. Cybersecurity researcher Dennis Giese flagged these flaws last year, questioning the security of the company's backend system. While Ecovacs is working to address these vulnerabilities and has promised to implement comprehensive security testing, the current situation casts doubt on the protection of user data.

Ecovacs claims that it anonymizes user information during data collection, although past incidents have shown how easily such sensitive data can be leaked. The company asserts that the data is crucial for developing AI capabilities, having struggled to find adequate datasets for training purposes. 

This situation echoes past events where data collected by smart devices led to privacy breaches, reminding users to be cautious about the information they share with technology companies.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the privacy concerns raised by the data collection practices of Ecovacs, the manufacturer of Deebot robot vacuums. Users express skepticism about the company's claims of anonymizing data collected for AI training, referencing past incidents where sensitive information was exposed.

One comment highlights the broader issue that many Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collecting data without user awareness or consent, with commenters suggesting that this behavior is not exclusive to Ecovacs. The participants touch upon the importance of being informed consumers and doing thorough research before purchasing tech products that might compromise privacy.

There are also mentions of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in these devices, and some users argue that major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple have similar issues with privacy and data usage. A recurring sentiment is the call for better legislation to protect consumer data and hold companies accountable.

The discussion underscores a cautious attitude among users towards technological advancements, particularly when it comes to their personal privacy and data security, pushing for greater transparency and ethical responsibility from manufacturers.
