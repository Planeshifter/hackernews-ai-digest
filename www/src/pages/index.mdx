### Code-GUI bidirectional editing via LSP

#### [Submission URL](https://jamesbvaughan.com/bidirectional-editing/) | 232 points | by [jamesbvaughan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jamesbvaughan) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44435716)

In an exciting development from the tech world, James B. Vaughan has unveiled a fascinating proof-of-concept for a robust system that enables real-time bidirectional editing between any modern code editor and a graphical user interface (GUI), all powered by a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server. Vaughan, a self-professed fan of code-based CAD projects and a dedicated programmer with a custom, comfortable development environment, was inspired by Kevin Lynagh's ongoing codeCAD project, which explores similar bidirectional editing ideas.

The novelty here is not the concept of bidirectional editing itself, but rather the implementation that allows seamless real-time updates between code and GUI using the favorite editors of developers. Vaughan quickly put together a prototype featuring a text editor alongside a GUI where both could update each other simultaneously. This impressive feat is achieved with a small server using LSP to facilitate communication between the text editor and the GUI via WebSockets.

Vaughan's work stands out from existing software by combining real-time synchronization with flexibility in editor choice, something competitors like Fusion 360, OpenSCAD, and Zoo currently fall short of, each only achieving partial solutions. Although Vaughan considers this project a preliminary demonstration and doesn’t plan to expand it right away, it opens up promising pathways for future applications and inspires potential innovations in LSP usage in CAD environments.

His project highlights just how compelling the integration of LSP servers with graphical programming interfaces can be, sparking excitement about the possibilities for more advanced real-time, bidirectional coding environments. The community is buzzing with the potential for further development, especially with tools like OpenSCAD and Kevin Lynagh’s codeCAD—not to mention the work Vaughan is involved with at Arcol, a company already making strides in CAD interface design.

### Show HN: Spegel, a Terminal Browser That Uses LLMs to Rewrite Webpages

#### [Submission URL](https://simedw.com/2025/06/23/introducing-spegel/) | 408 points | by [simedw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simedw) | [177 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44433409)

In a late-night burst of creativity, an intriguing terminal-based web browser named Spegel was born. This proof-of-concept tool is not your typical browser; instead, it relies on the power of large language models (LLMs) to transform web content by feeding HTML through an LLM and rendering it as markdown in your terminal.

Spegel, inspired by the Swedish word for "mirror", allows users to personalize their web viewing experience using custom prompts. Imagine being able to switch between different views of a webpage, such as simplifying content down to an "Explain Like I'm 5" (ELI5) level or highlighting just the crucial bits of a recipe. This personalization is achieved through configurations in a TOML file, where users can define their own prompts and views.

The browser's simplicity comes from its functionality: no JavaScript and only GET requests, making it light yet efficient. With support from Google's newly like Gemini 2.5 Pro Lite model, Spegel is about processing web content faster and more economically compared to traditional methods. This new browser demonstrates how LLMs can enhance online experiences by tailoring content to individual preferences in real-time, making previously expensive and slow transformations quick and accessible.

Spegel allows users to focus on what matters by stripping away unnecessary noise like CSS and JavaScript, particularly on terminals with limited display space. While it doesn't aim to replace conventional terminal browsers like Lynx or modernly styled ones like Browsh, it provides a unique dadaist exploration into potential future applications of LLMs in everyday tech usage.

Spegel's code and its potential for community-driven growth are available on GitHub. If you're up for trying something new and experimental, install Spegel via pip and configure your browsing setup in `~/.spegel.toml`. The project is still rough around the edges but promises an intriguing direction for those keen on blending terminal usability with AI-driven personalization. Explore more at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simedw/spegel) to get involved or just play around with this novel browser yourself!

The discussion around Spegel, a terminal-based web browser using LLMs to transform web content, highlights both enthusiasm and skepticism. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Themes:
1. **Technical Comparisons & Alternatives**  
   - Users liken Spegel to existing tools (e.g., `grundnews` for news summarization, Firefox Reader Mode for cleaner HTML) and command-line tools. Some suggest preprocessing HTML to reduce token costs before feeding it to LLMs.
   - Concerns about functionality limitations (lack of POST requests, JavaScript) and technical trade-offs (DOM vs. HTML processing) are noted.

2. **Personalization & Ethics**  
   - Spegel’s use of LLMs for tailored content (e.g., simplified or interactive views) sparks debate. Critics argue LLMs risk generating SEO spam or shallow summaries, while supporters see potential for liberating users from cluttered web experiences.
   - Ethical concerns arise about LLMs using scraped content without compensating creators, perpetuating exploitative systems.

3. **Workflow Integration & Practicality**  
   - Ideas for integrating Spegel include merging it with command-line workflows or leveraging browsing history to personalize content. Some envision AI agents negotiating content preferences on behalf of users.
   - Skepticism exists around non-deterministic LLM outputs and whether they add meaningful novelty beyond initial hype.

4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Discussions touch on AI’s role in reshaping content ecosystems, such as disrupting SEO-driven strategies (e.g., lengthy articles for ad revenue). Others warn of “filter bubbles” amplifying partisan perspectives.
   - A humorous critique targets recipe sites bloated with ads and anecdotes, with mixed views on whether LLM-based extraction improves or worsens this.

### Community Sentiment  
The community acknowledges Spegel’s experimental appeal but stresses caution. While intrigued by its potential to simplify browsing and empower users, there’s wariness about dependency on ethically fraught AI models and the technical challenges of reliable content transformations. The project is seen as a creative step toward reimagining web interaction, albeit with significant hurdles ahead.

### Building a Personal AI Factory

#### [Submission URL](https://www.john-rush.com/posts/ai-20250701.html) | 242 points | by [derek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=derek) | [145 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44438065)

Today on Hacker News, a fascinating post delves into the creative process behind building a "Personal AI Factory" by leveraging multiple AI agents simultaneously. The piece, titled "Building a Personal AI Factory," offers a snapshot of operations as of July 2025, emphasizing the transformative power of treating AI tools not just as code generators, but as evolving team members.

The methodology revolves around a principle that might resonate with developers: "Fix Inputs, Not Outputs." Instead of patching code manually, the author refines the foundational plans, prompts, and agent combinations, ensuring future runs are done correctly by design. Think of it as a clever sandbox strategy, akin to the video game Factorio, where efficiency compounding is achieved through self-improving AI agents.

Here's how the workflow unfolds:

1. **Planning**: Tasks are outlined using Claude code alongside an agent called o3 to generate a thorough implementation blueprint. The result is documented in detail to ensure the plan's success from the start.

2. **Execution**: AI agents, Sonnet 3.7 and 4, execute these plans, with Sonnet 4 often deployed for tasks requiring precision in Clojure syntax. Importantly, all changes are committed incrementally, allowing for easy reversions if needed.

3. **Verification and Feedback**: Post-execution, Sonnet 4 and o3 rigorously verify the code against initial plans, eliminating incompatible code or lint ignores as suggested by Claude. Any issues identified are incorporated into the planning phase, thus enhancing future projects.

One intriguing facet is the development of bespoke agent 'factories' for specific tasks, such as adhering to local coding styles or optimizing workflows. This modular approach allows for layering simple agent tasks into more complex operations, including API integrations and automated documentation.

The philosophy here is maximizing the utility of AI agent interactions via iteration. Multiple attempts are encouraged, with learnings from failures feeding back into input adjustments. This loop transforms a set of disposable outputs into a robust system of compounding capabilities.

Looking forward, the author plans to refine agent coordination, align more closely with business objectives, build increasingly complex workflows, and optimize token usage across platforms.

In summary, this narrative isn't just about code generation; it illustrates a forward-thinking application of AI that treats agents as collaborative partners. It's an inspiring call to see beyond traditional coding to more adaptive, iterative development processes.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion:

### Key Themes of the Debate  
1. **Trivial vs. Non-Trivial AI Use Cases**  
   - Critics argue many examples labeled "non-trivial" (e.g., fixing Clojure indentation) are actually trivial. True non-trivial tasks (e.g., debugging complex systems like Mandelbrot generators in assembly, revising LLVM optimizations) demand weeks of specialized human expertise and iterative refinement.  
   - Pushback: LLMs excel at incremental "shallow" tasks (pattern matching, boilerplate code) but struggle with deeply context-dependent, creative problems or systems requiring domain-specific intuition.  

2. **Real-World Applications**  
   - Success stories:  
     - Upgrading React versions by combining LLMs with search tools ([example](httpssimonwillisonnet2025Apr21ai-ssstd-srch#l)).  
     - Assisting in **reverse-engineering code**, shortening implementation time by extracting insights from documentation.  
   - Failures:  
     - Open-source contributions (e.g., React chart libraries) often produce unreliable code without deep system understanding.  
     - Cloudflare’s AI-assisted OAuth implementation led to security flaws despite rigorous review ([CVE-2025-4143](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj)).  

3. **Impact on Engineering Jobs**  
   - Some argue LLMs streamline workflows, making engineers "10x faster/cheaper." Others counter that automating shallow tasks shifts focus to harder problems (e.g., compliance, architecture) *without* reducing the need for skilled developers.  

4. **Limitations of Benchmarks**  
   - Skepticism toward AI "puzzles" (e.g., Apple’s reasoning paper) as indicators of real-world coding skill. LLMs often fail when problems exceed training data or require novel reasoning.  

5. **Education Concerns**  
   - Teaching CS students to rely on LLMs risks stunting foundational skills (e.g., assembly/architecture knowledge).  

### Illustrative Quotes  
- **“Non-trivial”:** *“Things that take specialists and skill lists months to create.”* – Defining tasks requiring human depth.  
- **Code Contributions:** *“Adding significant value to open-source projects isn’t ‘pretty trivial.’”* – Highlighting gaps in AI’s understanding.  

### Final Takeaway  
While LLMs excel at narrow, repetitive tasks (code formatting, boilerplate), their role in complex engineering remains debated. Critics emphasize human oversight is irreplaceable for system-level thinking, while proponents see AI as augmenting productivity within clear boundaries.

Hey tech enthusiasts! Today on Hacker News, we've got something that will likely pique the interest of anyone diving deep into the world of large language models (LLMs). Enter C.O.R.E., the Contextual Observation & Recall Engine, a personal and fully portable memory layer for LLMs. With 238 stars already, it’s gaining traction for how it promises to revolutionize memory management for AI applications.

C.O.R.E. is no ordinary memory system—it's designed to provide users with complete ownership of a dynamic and living knowledge graph that’s private and portable. Whether you're running it locally or using the cloud-hosted version, C.O.R.E. stands out by organizing memories as interconnected, traceable “Statements” that evolve over time. It captures who said what, when it happened, and why it matters, unlike the static "sticky notes" many systems use.

This powerhouse of a tool could be a game-changer for compliance and auditing. For example, asking for changes in pricing since Q1 allows you to track approvals and contexts like meetings and emails, providing unparalleled transparency and traceability. The tool also offers integrations with others, such as Cursor, allowing users to connect their own memory repository across various platforms.

For those eager to get their hands dirty, setting up C.O.R.E. locally involves Docker, OpenAI’s API, and some command-line magic. The GitHub repo offers detailed steps, including how to create your private knowledge space and add memories. You'll also learn to programmatically interact with C.O.R.E. via APIs for more advanced use cases.

Still in progress is improved compatibility with Llama-based models, but updates are on the horizon. Dive into their demo video for a closer look and see for yourself how C.O.R.E. might just become your go-to tool for enhancing AI memory capabilities!

2. **Integration & Compatibility**:  
   - Users inquire about compatibility with models like **Claude** and **Llama**. Contributors note ongoing work to expand support beyond OpenAI, with mentions of local setups using vLLM or LMStudio.  

3. **Memory Challenges**:  
   - Discussants highlight hurdles like balancing context constraints with recall depth, avoiding "overwhelm" from irrelevant data, and ensuring traceability. CORE’s structured approach—using temporal tracking, explicit inclusion/exclusion of statements, and graph-based retrieval—is seen as addressing these issues.  

4. **Comparisons to Alternatives**:  
   - Comparisons to tools like **Zep** focus on CORE’s portability (cloud/desktop support), individual-first design, and “reified” temporal graphs that track *why* changes occur, not just *when*.  

5. **Semantic Web Debate**:  
   - Some question whether explicit semantic triples (RDF-style) are necessary, given LLMs’ ability to infer relationships. CORE’s team argues explicit structuring aids efficient retrieval and contradiction detection, though others prefer lightweight methods like Markdown.  

6. **Trade-offs**:  
   - While CORE’s complexity adds overhead, users acknowledge its value for compliance, auditing, and use cases requiring relational context (e.g., healthcare or pricing changes). Simpler systems may suffice for basic recall.  

**Final Takeaway**: The community views CORE as a promising step toward adaptable, explainable AI memory systems, though adoption may hinge on balancing its power with usability and broader model compatibility.

### Claude Code now supports hooks

#### [Submission URL](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) | 371 points | by [ramoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ramoz) | [161 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44429225)

Anthropic has rolled out a comprehensive guide on using "Claude Code" hooks on their platform. The new functionality allows developers to define shell commands, known as hooks, that execute at certain points in Claude Code’s lifecycle, providing deterministic control over its behavior. This enables users to automate notifications, format code automatically, enforce logging standards, give feedback on coding conventions, and set up custom permissions. It essentially turns what would have been LLM suggestions into reliable app-level commands that execute without user confirmation.

To get started, developers need to configure their settings files and can set up hooks to, for example, log all shell commands executed by Claude Code using tools like jq for JSON processing. The hooks, which execute with full user permissions, need to be handled with care to prevent security issues, as users are responsible for their safe use.

For practical implementation, Anthropic provides a quickstart guide detailing how to configure these hooks—complete with setting up matchers for specific tool calls, logging commands, and verifying configurations. This tool promises a more structured and predictable interaction with Claude Code, empowering developers to enforce consistent workflows and improve automation within their development environments. However, Anthropic underscores the importance of reviewing security considerations to avoid possible data loss or system damage.

The discussion around Anthropic's Claude Code hooks reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Craftsmanship vs. Automation**:  
   - Many users express concern that AI tools like Claude Code might erode software craftsmanship, drawing parallels to digital art and photography, where automation increased output but diluted traditional skills. Critics argue AI-generated code could lead to brittle, hard-to-debug systems, likening it to "sloppy" early digital art or hastily assembled plumbing.  
   - Others counter that AI democratizes access to powerful tools, enabling faster development while still requiring human oversight for quality.

2. **Impact on Jobs and Industry**:  
   - Fears arise that AI could eliminate coding jobs, similar to how tractors reduced agricultural labor. However, some note that demand for software often grows to absorb productivity gains.  
   - A subset predicts disruption for SaaS companies, as cheaper AI tools might replace expensive subscriptions, favoring custom solutions over bloated enterprise software.

3. **Transitional Shifts**:  
   - Commentators liken the current AI wave to historical shifts (e.g., Winamp → streaming, Photoshop → digital art tools), acknowledging a messy transition period where old and new paradigms clash. Some foresee a "Cambrian explosion" of niche tools but warn of fragmentation and complexity.

4. **Security and Responsibility**:  
   - Warnings emerge about the risks of powerful hooks, with references to *Jurassic Park* cautioning against uncontrolled permissions. Users stress that AI tools, while convenient, could introduce security flaws if misconfigured or over-relied upon.

5. **Quality and Maintenance**:  
   - Skepticism abounds regarding AI's ability to handle edge cases, with anecdotes about brittle Excel-based systems and hallucinations in code generation. Some lament a decline in "hand-crafted" software reliability compared to older, simpler tools.

6. **Economic and Cultural Tensions**:  
   - Debates highlight divides between efficiency-driven automation and artisanal values, with some users mourning the loss of pride in craftsmanship, while others embrace AI's potential to reduce drudgery.

In summary, the discussion reflects both optimism about AI's democratizing potential and deep anxiety about its impact on quality, jobs, and the soul of software development. The community grapples with balancing automation's efficiency against the irreplaceable nuance of human expertise.

### Cloudflare to introduce pay-per-crawl for AI bots

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/) | 531 points | by [scotchmi_st](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=scotchmi_st) | [283 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44432385)

In a world where digital content is in high demand but often consumed without compensation, Cloudflare is pioneering a new approach: "pay per crawl." Unveiled as a private beta, this innovative service gives content creators the power to charge AI crawlers for accessing their material, effectively enabling monetization at an internet-wide scale. Traditionally, creators faced a tough choice: allow free, unfettered access to their content or block out all automated traffic. Cloudflare's solution offers a welcome third alternative, allowing creators to dictate terms on who, how, and when their content is accessed.

Here's how it works: the system hinges on the seldom-used HTTP response code 402, "Payment Required." Through predefined rules, publishers can demand payment from AI crawlers wishing to access their sites. They can set a standard fee per request and then opt to allow, charge, or block any crawler accordingly. Cloudflare takes care of the technical aspects, acting as a merchant of record.

Significantly, this setup assures content owners remain in control. They can choose to charge certain crawlers while granting others free access, or negotiate bespoke deals outside the system. Integration with existing security measures ensures offerings align seamlessly with security protocols.

For AI crawlers, staying compliant involves authenticating requests via HTTPS message signatures, backed by Ed25519 key pairs. They can detect when payment is needed and decide if they wish to proceed at the presented cost, or, conversely, signal preferred rates upfront.

Ultimately, "pay per crawl" empowers publishers to monetize AI's curiosity, potentially enriching both content owners and the web itself by incentivizing curated access to high-quality digital resources.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and philosophical debates surrounding microtransactions vs. subscription models for content monetization. Key points include:

1. **Microtransaction Fatigue:** Users argue that requiring frequent, small payments for individual content (e.g., articles, videos) creates mental overhead and decision fatigue. The repeated need to decide "Is this worth paying for?" exhausts consumers, making bundling (e.g., Spotify, YouTube Premium) more appealing despite middleman fees.

2. **Bundling Pros/Cons:** Subscription models are praised for simplifying access with flat fees but criticized for fragmenting content across platforms and disconnecting creators from direct revenue (e.g., streaming services’ opaque payouts). Some suggest "content credits" tied to usage, allowing users to allocate a monthly budget proportionally to consumed content.

3. **Trust and Middlemen:** Concerns arise about centralized intermediaries (e.g., Cloudflare, Coinbase’s x402 project) replicating existing problems (corruption, opaque revenue splits). Critics argue distributed systems (e.g., BitTorrent-like credit mechanisms) could bypass middlemen, but trust and enforcement remain hurdles.

4. **Technical Feasibility:** Some note that microtransactions might work best for negligibly low costs (e.g., fractions of a cent per AI query), minimizing decision friction. Others cite Flattr 2.0 as a prior attempt at usage-based revenue sharing.

5. **User Behavior:** Participants debate whether flat fees or credits align with human habits—flat fees offer simplicity but incentivize overconsumption, while credit systems risk complicating budgeting (e.g., "Should I watch a $10 movie or read articles this month?").

6. **Alternative Models:** Ideas like time-based payments ("Donate 60 minutes/month to creators") or decentralized trust networks emerge, but face skepticism over implementation. Existing platforms (YouTube, Spotify) are seen as imperfect compromises balancing creator revenue and user convenience.

In essence, the conversation highlights a tension: while microtransactions offer granular fairness, their psychological and logistical costs clash with the simplicity of subscriptions—yet both struggle to ensure equitable compensation and user satisfaction without centralized intermediaries.

### Small language models are the future of agentic AI

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02153) | 110 points | by [favoboa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=favoboa) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44430311)

A recent paper submitted to arXiv is stirring up the AI community by suggesting that Small Language Models (SLMs) might be the keystone for the future of agentic AI. Authored by Peter Belcak and his team, the paper argues that while Large Language Models (LLMs) have been celebrated for their versatile capabilities and human-like conversational prowess, there’s a growing realm of applications where their massive scale isn't just unnecessary but economically inefficient.

According to the authors, many agentic AI systems—those which carry out repetitive, specialized tasks—can operate effectively with SLMs. These smaller models deliver adequate performance, tailored suitability, and economic advantages, presenting them as a viable alternative for specialized tasks. The paper sheds light on SLMs as the next frontier, advocating for their use in contexts where a few specialized tasks are repeated with minimal variation.

The authors also introduce the concept of heterogeneous agentic systems, which combine multiple models, as an optimal approach for tasks demanding conversational capabilities. They address potential barriers to the adoption of SLMs, propose an LLM-to-SLM conversion algorithm, and call for the AI community to debate and contribute further to this pivotal shift.

This paper is a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion about AI resource optimization and cost reduction, highlighting the strategic shift from large-scale to more focused AI applications. It sets the stage for realignment in how we perceive and deploy AI models, urging for a balance between operational demands and economic efficiency in the AI industry.

The discussion around using Small Language Models (SLMs) versus Large Language Models (LLMs) for agentic AI reflects practical frustrations and diverse opinions:

1. **Criticism of Current AI Implementations**:  
   Users shared exasperating experiences with LLM-driven customer service, such as Amazon’s refund process and Air Canada’s chatbot mistakenly promising discounts. These examples highlight failures where LLMs produced nonsensical replies, inefficient workflows, or legal risks, undermining trust in their reliability.

2. **Advocacy for Simpler Solutions**:  
   Some argued that **deterministic workflows** (via traditional NLP or rule-based systems) or narrowly scoped SLMs might outperform LLMs for repetitive tasks like refund processing. The reasoning: LLMs are overkill for structured, predictable tasks and introduce unnecessary complexity/costs. As one user put it, *“Why burn crazy amounts of tokens hoping it works 80% of the time when simpler, cheaper methods work 100% of the time?”*

3. **Corporate Cost-Cutting Concerns**:  
   Commenters criticized companies for opting for poorly implemented AI (e.g., Doordash, Lyft) to reduce expenses, resulting in worse customer experiences. Executives were accused of prioritizing cost savings over thoughtful design, leading to “enshittification” of support systems.

4. **Legal and Accountability Challenges**:  
   The Air Canada case sparked debate about holding companies liable for LLM errors. Critics noted corporations often deflect blame onto “chatbot hallucinations,” raising questions about legal frameworks and enforcement in the AI era.

5. **Hardware and Economic Pressures**:  
   NVIDIA’s dominance in AI hardware was cited as a factor pushing LLM adoption, potentially at the expense of SLM development. Some worry economic incentives (e.g., selling GPU clusters) may skew research priorities away from efficient, specialized models.

6. **Balancing Versatility vs. Specialization**:  
   While LLMs excel in versatility and general reasoning, many agreed that **heterogeneous systems** (mixing SLMs/LLMs) or task-specific models could optimize performance and cost. As one user noted, *“SLMs aren’t replacing LLMs—they’re complementary for specialized tasks.”*

**Consensus**: The community largely supports exploring SLMs for narrow, deterministic workflows (e.g., refunds, customer service) where LLMs’ flexibility is unnecessary. However, skepticism remains about corporate execution and over-reliance on LLMs as a panacea. The call is for pragmatic, context-aware AI design—not just scaling models indiscriminately.

### The new skill in AI is not prompting, it's context engineering

#### [Submission URL](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering) | 789 points | by [robotswantdata](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=robotswantdata) | [443 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44427757)

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, a new buzzword is emerging: Context Engineering. This concept is reshaping how AI tasks are approached, shifting focus from mere "prompt engineering" to a more holistic strategy that emphasizes the importance of context. According to Tobi Lutke, it involves "the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM."

Why is this crucial? As AI agents become more integrated into our daily lives, their success depends less on technical code capabilities, and more on the quality of the context they're given. This involves several layers of information – from initial instructions and user prompts to long-term memory and retrieved external knowledge. The blend of these elements determines if an AI agent is merely functional or “magical.”

### There are no new ideas in AI, only new datasets

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-are-no-new-ideas-in-ai-only) | 460 points | by [bilsbie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bilsbie) | [252 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44423983)

Join us on a journey through the evolution of AI as narrated by Jack Morris in his thought-provoking piece, "There Are No New Ideas in AI… Only New Datasets." Morris dives into the heart of AI's progress over the past decade and a half, suggesting that while innovative ideas seem to have plateaued, it's the continual discovery and utilization of new datasets that are truly driving advancements.

Amid an era of exponential growth akin to a "Moore's Law for AI," Morris challenges the common narrative that breakthroughs come solely from fresh ideas birthed in academia and industry powerhouses like MIT, Stanford, and Google. Instead, he argues, the linchpin of innovation is often these treasure troves of data that empower existing techniques.

Morris takes us through the landmarks of AI evolution: the rise of Deep Neural Networks inspired by AlexNet's triumph in 2012, the transformative introduction of transformers like BERT and GPT from 2017 onwards, the incorporation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in 2022, and the frontiers reached by reasoning models in 2024. Each of these milestones, Morris emphasizes, is rooted in leveraging new, vast datasets, whether it's labeled image databases or the sprawling text of the internet.

In his analysis, Morris suggests we search for the next AI breakthrough not in unprecedented concepts but in fresh applications of longstanding methods coupled with untapped data sources. As AI models continue becoming smarter and more efficient with each passing year, it seems the secret to future innovation lies not in reinventing the wheel but in unleashing the potential of data yet to be fully explored.

For those intrigued by AI's journey and its ever-unfolding future, Morris' piece acts as a guide, underlining the importance of viewing datasets as the true catalysts for next-gen AI breakthroughs.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Jack Morris's article, *"There Are No New Ideas in AI… Only New Datasets,"* expands on the limitations and future directions of AI, emphasizing several key themes:

### 1. **Multimodal Integration vs. Current AI Limitations**  
Participants argue that human intelligence’s richness stems from multimodal inputs (touch, smell, motor skills, emotions), which current models like LLMs and vision transformers lack. Users highlight that AI’s focus on text and images overlooks critical sensory data (e.g., texture, temperature, proprioception) essential for understanding the physical world. For instance, one commenter notes how infants explore through tactile interaction, a gap in AI’s "disembodied" learning.

### 2. **Abstraction vs. Embodiment**  
Debates arise over language’s role as an abstraction of sensory input. While some argue language inherently captures higher cognition, others counter that true intelligence requires *embodiment*—physical interaction with the world. A subthread even likens programming languages (e.g., Java) to "lower cognitive functions," suggesting that abstract models alone (like LLMs) struggle to replicate grounded reasoning or intuitive physics without sensory integration.

### 3. **Compute vs. Datasets**  
A counterpoint challenges Morris’s emphasis on datasets, proposing that hardware advancements and computational power (e.g., Transformers’ scalability) have driven progress more than data. One user argues that even with 20-year-old datasets, modern compute could yield breakthroughs, questioning whether truly "new ideas" are needed if hardware continues to improve. However, others doubt scaling current models without 10–100x compute gains.

### 4. **Dynamic Learning and Memory**  
Critiques of LLMs’ static training cycles emerge, contrasting them with human neuroplasticity and real-time learning. Users stress the need for AI systems that adapt dynamically, retain/forget memories contextually, and incorporate feedback loops—traits current models lack. Forgetting is paradoxically noted as *useful* for filtering noise, suggesting machines might need similar mechanisms.

### 5. **Beyond Language Models**  
While LLMs dominate headlines, commenters urge attention to underappreciated AI frontiers: robotics, audio processing, and simulations. Progress in these areas, though less hyped, could integrate multisensory data (e.g., lidar, haptics) and bridge the gap between digital models and physical understanding.

### Conclusion  
The discussion amplifies Morris’s thesis but complicates it: while datasets are crucial, participants stress that *embodied, multimodal experiences* and hardware advances are equally vital for next-gen AI. Language and vision alone may abstractly mimic human cognition, but true breakthroughs might require richer sensory integration, dynamic learning, and a shift beyond the current LLM paradigm.

   - Critics highlight how features like GPU vendor hashes and browser-rendering quirks create identifiers that undermine privacy tools (e.g., VPNs, randomized user agents).  

2. **Impact on Non-Mainstream Browsers**:  
   - Independent browsers (e.g., Firefox) and privacy-focused tools face usability issues, as BotID’s signals may flag them as bots. Apple’s approach with randomized Safari user agents on iPads is noted as a partial workaround, but imperfect.  

3. **Technical and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Real-time detection via headers, TLS fingerprints, and behavioral metrics risks **false positives**, harming legitimate users who employ privacy measures.  
   - Some argue fingerprinting contradicts the open web’s ideals, turning security into a form of surveillance.  

4. **Broader Bot-Detection Challenges**:  
   - Commentators debate the practicality of heuristics like IP geolocation, TCP stack differences, and request timing. Combining signals improves bot detection but may over-rely on opaque algorithms.  
   - Services like Anubis are mentioned as alternatives that focus on disrupting bots via “tarpits” (delaying responses) rather than aggressive fingerprinting.  

5. **Browser Ecosystem Dynamics**:  
   - Mozilla’s dependence on Google funding and Apple/Google’s conflicting incentives (privacy vs. tracking) shape how browsers handle anti-bot measures.  

The discussion underscores a tension: while BotID offers streamlined bot protection, its methods risk sacrificing **user privacy** and accessibility, sparking debate over where to draw the line between security and an open web.

### Scribble-based forecasting and AI 2027

#### [Submission URL](https://dynomight.net/scribbles/) | 53 points | by [venkii](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=venkii) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44424996)

The article on Dynomight ponders the challenge of forecasting, focusing particularly on the possibility that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive as early as 2027. It explores the traditional methods of predicting future events, contrasting intuition-based forecasts with math-based models. The author dives into the complexity of models like those used for climate change forecasts, where enormous amounts of data and numerous interacting variables create a robust, though data-intensive, prediction framework.

On the other hand, forecasting something as nebulous as AGI involves a lot more guesswork and fewer well-defined rules. While intuition might often be criticized in forecasting due to its subjective nature, the article argues that math-based forecasting isn’t devoid of arbitrary assumptions either; it just hides them under layers of calculations. The piece suggests a balance between intuition and mathematics might be necessary, leaning on ‘scribble-based forecasting’—a playful method of drawing intuitive connections on data as a personal favorite approach.

Central to this discussion is the AI 2027 forecast, which predicts AGI based on current AI capabilities in performing various tasks. The forecast model used in the article suggests that if AI can handle tasks equivalent to those a human could complete in a significantly long time frame (from one month to ten years), we’re nearing AGI. The prediction relies on the AI reaching a high success rate in these tasks, aiming for an 80% completion rate.

Ultimately, the article is a mix of philosophical inquiry and technical discussion, challenging readers to question the validity and reliability of various forecasting methods, especially when predicting something as transformative as AGI. It leaves an open-ended query about the role of both intuitive and mathematical strategies in trying to foresee complex, potentially world-altering developments.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion critiques the article’s forecasting methods and its 2027 AGI prediction, highlighting skepticism and methodological debates:

1. **Model Limitations**:  
   - Users argue that math-based models (e.g., extrapolations like Moore’s Law) or intuitive "scribble-based" forecasts risk oversimplification. Hidden assumptions and arbitrary axis scaling (e.g., linear vs. logarithmic) can distort predictions, making extrapolations misleading. Critics note that models might overfit data or lack prior plausibility, especially for AGI.

2. **AGI 2027 Prediction**:  
   - The 2027 timeline is dismissed by some as overly simplistic or sci-fi-like. Concerns include dependencies on unpredictable factors (e.g., political decisions, funding) and the absence of evidence for recursive self-improvement in AI systems. A linked paper ([arXiv:2506.22419](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22419)) suggests current AI shows poor self-improvement capabilities, though others counter that future AI-driven research breakthroughs could accelerate progress.

3. **Methodological Debates**:  
   - Some defend the "scribble" method as a flexible, qualitative tool for exploring hypotheses, while others favor probabilistic approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) or William Briggs’ focus on observable probabilities. The balance between subjective intuition and quantitative rigor is emphasized, with warnings against treating models as infallible.

4. **External Factors**:  
   - Broader societal and technical challenges—data silos, AI alignment, and geopolitical risks—are noted as potential roadblocks to AGI. The discussion underscores the difficulty of forecasting amid such complexity.
