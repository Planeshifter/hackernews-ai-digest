### Finding near-duplicates with Jaccard similarity and MinHash

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/) | 226 points | by [brianyu8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianyu8) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872438)

In a recent blog post, the author delves into the topic of approximate deduplication using Jaccard similarity and the MinHash approximation technique. The post explores the concept of defining similarity between documents and the challenges of approximate deduplication at scale.

The Jaccard index, a measure widely used in text processing, compares sets by calculating the ratio of their overlap to the size of their union. The author explains how this index intuitively captures the similarity between sets based on their elements.

To scale up the process of finding approximate duplicates, the post discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing techniques for Jaccard similarity. By creating MinHash signatures for documents, which are small, fixed-size representations of the original sets, similar documents can be grouped efficiently.

By employing random sampling techniques and permutations, MinHash signatures offer a way to estimate Jaccard similarity between documents without examining the entire sets. This approach provides a practical method for identifying approximate duplicates within a large collection of documents.

#### [Submission URL](https://boyuan.space/diffusion-forcing/) | 206 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40871783)

The paper "Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion" introduces a novel training paradigm that combines the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models and next-token prediction models. By training a diffusion model to denoise tokens with varying noise levels, this approach, called Diffusion Forcing, allows for flexible and compositional generation while offering sequence-level guidance.

Diffusion Forcing can stabilize auto-regressive rollout, guide over long horizons, and support planning with causal uncertainty by utilizing different noise levels across a sequence during sampling. The method showcases stable and consistent video prediction results in datasets like DMLab and Minecraft, outperforming traditional teacher forcing and causal full-sequence diffusion models.

Moreover, Diffusion Forcing enables the generation of long videos beyond the training horizon without the need for a sliding window approach, demonstrating its stabilization effect. It also extends to diffusion planning, offering a decision-making framework with causal relationships and the ability to model long-horizon tasks like real robot arm manipulations.

### The Learning System

#### [Submission URL](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/learningsystem) | 27 points | by [Curiositry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Curiositry) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40841701)

In a thought-provoking piece titled "Escaping Flatland" on the Learning System, Henrik Karlsson explores the idea of decentralized knowledge and its role in education. He suggests that our world thrives on a vast, unseen reservoir of knowledge accumulated through informal processes, contrasting it with the formal education system. Karlsson argues that while schools and universities are vital, true learning occurs informally through on-the-job training, social interactions, and self-directed exploration.

He delves into the concept of the "learning system," which encompasses the organic spread of knowledge outside traditional educational institutions. Karlsson emphasizes the effectiveness of self-directed learning, citing examples of individuals gaining expertise in fields like blockchain technology through informal channels like online resources and mentorship. However, he acknowledges the potential pitfalls of decentralized knowledge transfer, such as the loss of critical skills or the perpetuation of harmful practices.

By examining the distinctions between the formal education system and the learning system, Karlsson prompts readers to consider how we can leverage decentralized knowledge reproduction to enhance the dissemination of valuable information. He challenges the conventional view of education by advocating for a more convivial, self-directed approach to learning that complements institutionalized education. Ultimately, his essay encourages a reevaluation of how we perceive and engage with knowledge in a rapidly evolving world.

The discussion on the submission "Escaping Flatland" revolves around contrasting intrinsic incentives and extrinsic incentives in education. One user, prst, emphasizes the importance of intrinsic incentives (like the internal motivation to learn) over extrinsic incentives (such as rewards and punishments) in promoting learning. They argue that the lack of intrinsic motivation in current educational systems is a significant drawback. Another user, shortrounddev2, points out the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, noting that intrinsic incentives are crucial for self-directed learning and can surpass the performance of students who rely on external motivators like rewards or punishments.

Additionally, a user named drkps shares insights on the state of public schooling, drawing on Henrik Karlsson's thoughts in the original submission. They raise questions about the effectiveness of public schools in preparing children for real-life situations, especially those coming from dysfunctional homes. By questioning the focus on learning practical life skills versus academic subjects, drkps highlights the potential disconnect between traditional education systems and the actual needs of students.

### What is 'AI washing' and why is it a problem?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9xx8122893o) | 34 points | by [bcta1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bcta1) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40843438)

Amazon faced scrutiny over the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores, specifically the "Just Walk Out" system that allows customers to grab items and leave without going through a traditional checkout process. Reports revealed that the system required manual checking of transactions by workers in India, leading to questions about the accuracy of Amazon's claims about the technology.

This incident highlighted a broader issue of "AI washing," where companies may exaggerate the capabilities of their AI systems for marketing or competitive purposes. The term refers to the practice of making inflated claims about AI usage, similar to "green washing" in environmental contexts.

As the use of AI becomes more prevalent in various industries, there is a growing concern about companies misrepresenting their AI capabilities. Some startups may feel pressured to incorporate AI into their pitches to attract investment, even if the technology's role in their solutions is minimal. This trend has caught the attention of investors and regulators, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission taking action against firms for false statements about their AI use.

The lack of a clear definition of AI and the ambiguity surrounding its usage contribute to the problem of AI washing. This trend not only poses risks for businesses and investors but also has the potential to erode consumer trust in innovative companies genuinely leveraging AI technology. Regulators in both the US and the UK are starting to address this issue through existing laws and codes of conduct, aiming to prevent misleading claims about AI capabilities in marketing communications.
