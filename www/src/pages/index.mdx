### Cold-blooded software

#### [Submission URL](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/) | 500 points | by [arbesman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbesman) | [198 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38793206)

In his blog post, "Cold-blooded software," Patrick Dubroy draws an interesting analogy between cold-blooded animals and software projects. He recounts a lecture where he learned about the remarkable ability of painted turtle hatchlings to survive being frozen. Just as cold-blooded animals adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them, Dubroy suggests that software projects should adopt a similar approach. He argues that warm-blooded projects, which thrive on constant motion and activity, are vulnerable to failure when frozen, akin to being put on hold for several months. In contrast, cold-blooded projects, like the baby painted turtle, can be frozen and easily picked back up without missing a beat. Dubroy emphasizes the importance of using "boring" technology in cold-blooded projects. By relying on vendored dependencies and avoiding external services that may change or disappear, he believes that software projects can remain resilient and functional for years to come. Dubroy shares the example of his own software project, a static site generator written in Python, which has remained intact and functional for twelve years. He concludes by saying that he fully expects it to continue working for another twelve years. The analogy and insights provided by Dubroy offer a unique perspective on the resilience and longevity of software projects.

Burger King in Brazil has launched a campaign called "Hangover Whopper" that provides discounts on the brand's sandwiches to hungover consumers. The campaign uses facial recognition technology to scan a consumer's face and detect the degree of their hangover, offering a corresponding combo coupon for the Whopper Jr. Double, Whopper, or Whopper Double. The selfies taken during the process can also be shared on social media. Burger King has a history of using creative mobile technology campaigns to drive engagement and increase traffic to its app and restaurants. This campaign, created in partnership with agency DM9, runs through January 2nd and is available only for BK Delivery.

The discussion surrounding Burger King's "Hangover Whopper" campaign on Hacker News covers a range of topics. 
One user points out that Burger King has faced challenges in Russia and Ukraine, with hundreds of its major international franchises having to leave these countries. Another user shares a personal anecdote about their experience with Burger King's breakfast promotion. They recall being disappointed after walking into Burger King for a breakfast burger only to be told they had to wait until 9 am to order one. Eventually, they were offered a 2-for-1 happy hour deal.
The discussion then moves towards the marketing tactics of Burger King, with one user sarcastically commenting on the "new ways" they find to exploit consumers. Another user feels that the campaign is not realistic and points out that facial recognition technology is not always accurate.
Further comments criticize the campaign for incentivizing people to drink excessively and then consume fast food. One user mentions that this campaign is not the best idea considering it runs until January 2nd, right after New Year's Day, which is known for its hangovers. Another user jokingly suggests not serving people who are hungover.
Lastly, there are a few unrelated comments; one user mentions that they are in Brazil, where the campaign is being run, and another user simply states, "I'm flying to Brazil."

### OpenAI Pissed Off Developers by Phasing Out Plugins for GPTs

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/openai-pissed-off-developers-by-phasing-out-plugins-for-1851124124) | 49 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38773147)

OpenAI's recent email to plugin developers has caused some controversy. The company asked developers to switch from building plugins to building GPTs, which has upset many developers who prefer the functionality of plugins. Although OpenAI claims that plugins are not going away yet, they anticipate that most developers will eventually move to GPTs once the GPT Store goes live. The developer community feels that plugins are crucial for the development and progress of AI applications. OpenAI's move towards more consumer-friendly GPTs may ostracize the developer community, which is essential for building good GPTs. This is not the first time OpenAI has upset developers, as an earlier update to ChatGPT rendered many developers' products useless. OpenAI's focus on GPTs may be due to security concerns surrounding plugins. However, there are limitations with GPTs that make developers less enthusiastic about building them. OpenAI's approach seems to prioritize appealing to everyday consumers rather than developers, similar to Apple's approach of offering cleaner products with fewer ports. However, OpenAI needs developers to build useful AI applications to succeed.

Discussion Summary:
- One commenter mentioned that OpenAI's recent decision to migrate from plugins to GPTs has caused frustration among developers. They highlighted the importance of plugins for AI applications and expressed concerns about the limitations of GPTs.
- Another commenter pointed out that OpenAI's terms of service for plugins were not very clear, and some developers were unsure about what was allowed. They suggested that OpenAI should have encouraged custom system prompts and sandboxing with GPTs to improve functionality.
- A user mentioned that the sentiment toward plugins has been negative in recent months due to issues with latency and discovery. They argued that OpenAI's focus on the API and functional calls with GPTs may be a more efficient approach.
- One commenter noted that they have heard little about developers liking plugins and have seen many posts from companies praising OpenAI's decision. They speculate that developers may not be the target audience for OpenAI's products.
- Another user disagreed, stating that GPTs do not offer the same functionality as plugins, such as custom instructions and file handling. They argued that plugins could work alongside GPTs.
- One commenter explained that the reason OpenAI created GPTs was to generate synthetic data for training models, which leads to better quality results. They provided an estimate of the amount of data used and its impact on training.
- A user suggested that custom system prompts and sandboxing should be considered as external APIs and not be built externally.
- Lastly, a commenter expressed their dislike for negativity in the discussion.
