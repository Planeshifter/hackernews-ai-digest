### State tax officials are using AI to go after wealthy payers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/15/state-tax-officials-use-ai-to-go-after-wealthy-payers.html) | 13 points | by [perihelions](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=perihelions) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40046152)

New York State's tax department is getting serious about auditing high earners, reporting a 56% increase in audits in 2022, even with fewer auditors. The secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence. Using sophisticated AI algorithms, the state is targeting individuals who have potentially avoided paying taxes, especially those who have relocated during the pandemic to low-tax states like Florida or Texas. By analyzing factors like cellphone records to determine residency and work patterns, the state is challenging the legitimacy of these moves and holding individuals accountable for taxes owed.

Additionally, New York is scrutinizing remote workers, arguing that even if someone lives outside the state, if they work for a New York-based company, they are still liable for New York taxes. The state's "convenience rules" are leading to audits based on the idea that if someone retained belongings in New York, they didn't truly move, despite having established homes in other states. These aggressive tactics are part of a broader trend where state tax authorities are leveraging AI to target high-income individuals and ensure tax compliance. It's a reminder that even in the digital age, tax authorities are keeping a close eye on financial activities.

30,000 tech enthusiasts gathered in Las Vegas this week for Google Cloud's event, where the spotlight was firmly on generative AI. While Google showcased a plethora of AI enhancements to leverage its Gemini large language model, some demonstrations felt underwhelming, focusing mainly on Google's ecosystem. The emphasis on generative AI tools appeared promising, but implementing such advanced technology within organizations remains a daunting challenge, often underestimated by tech giants. The road to successful AI adoption is littered with organizational hurdles, legacy systems, and the need for robust data governance. Companies lagging in cloud adoption may find it even more challenging to embrace generative AI without first addressing fundamental issues like data quality. Despite the allure of cutting-edge tech, the key to unlocking AI's true potential lies in laying a solid foundation of clean, accessible data.

The discussion revolves around the topic of generative AI, as seen at the AWS Summit Sydney. There is a mix of views with some expressing excitement about AI in corporate settings, while others are more skeptical. One user mentions the importance of ensuring that computers understand shopping design software, while another expresses concerns over Google potentially giving manatees a hard time. Additionally, there is a comment about the tough job market in tech, highlighting the reality of some corporate tech offers being less appealing than they may seem.
