### AVX10/128 is a silly idea

#### [Submission URL](https://chipsandcheese.com/2023/10/11/avx10-128-is-a-silly-idea-and-should-be-completely-removed-from-the-specification/) | 127 points | by [picture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=picture) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37851029)

Intel has announced a new specification called AVX10, which aims to consolidate the various AVX-512 extensions into a single, easy-to-target specification. AVX10 is designed to bring together all the capabilities of AVX-512 into smaller implementations for consumer, micro-edge, and embedded devices that don't require the 32 512-bit registers used by AVX-512. The specification introduces a version modifier, denoted by ".N", which allows for incremental updates, and a reference to the vector register implementation size, denoted by "/M". The AVX10 specification mandates that all implementations have 32 registers, but the width of these registers depends on the given "/M". For example, AVX10/256 would have the same capabilities as AVX10/512, but with 256-bit wide registers. This means that existing code written for AVX-512 with 256-bit registers should be able to run fine with only a recompile. The AVX10 specification also includes features such as support for IEEE-754 half precision floating points and brain floating point 16 (BF16). Overall, AVX10 aims to simplify and consolidate the AVX-512 landscape, making it easier to target different devices with different register requirements.

The discussion on Hacker News is primarily focused on the implications and potential drawbacks of Intel's AVX10 specification. 

One commenter points out that AVX-512 indirectly causes performance issues and suggests that Intel could have informed OS writers earlier to avoid these problems. Another commenter agrees and mentions that AVX-256 has little to no performance cost.

There is also a discussion about the efficiency and benefits of AVX-512. Some believe that the larger register size of AVX-512 is not worth the increased complexity and instead prefer smaller register options.

### Google's AI stoplight program is now calming traffic in a dozen cities worldwide

#### [Submission URL](https://www.engadget.com/google-ai-stoplight-program-project-green-light-sustainability-traffic-110015328.html) | 27 points | by [gardenfelder](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gardenfelder) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37846273)

Google has announced new expansions for its Project Green Light initiative, which aims to tackle street-level pollution caused by vehicles idling at stop lights. The project uses machine learning systems to analyze traffic congestion data and optimize traffic timing at intersections. Early findings show a reduction in fuel consumption and intersection delay time of 10 to 20 percent. The pilot program has since grown to a dozen partner cities globally. Google plans to scale the project to more cities in 2024, with initial estimates suggesting a potential 30 percent reduction in stops. The company believes Project Green Light offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for cities to reduce carbon emissions.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the effectiveness of the Project Green Light initiative and the concept of traffic calming measures.

One user, lyjhn, criticizes the idea of traffic calming, noting that it often leads to increased frustration for drivers and does not necessarily improve safety. Another user, JambalayaJim, shares their personal experience, stating that traffic calming measures have made back streets more pleasant but have not necessarily improved safety.

bbbylrrybbby disagrees with the concept of traffic calming, arguing that it slows down cars but does not inherently make them safer. They highlight that accidents can occur at any speed and that parked cars can still kill someone even at low speeds.

tchnfnd expresses skepticism about Google's solution to distracted driving, suggesting that the problem can be solved if people pay attention to the traffic lights. They also mention that the behavior of people running red lights is a result of selfishness and not paying attention.

grdnfldr adds to the discussion, explaining that Google's machine learning systems use data from Google Maps to calculate traffic congestion and optimize traffic light timings.

vrdx questions the analytical solutions to traffic light scheduling, suggesting that they might be based on uncertain assumptions about traffic patterns.

Finally, dngs raises the point that pedestrians' experiences should also be considered when implementing traffic calming measures.

Overall, the discussion covers a range of opinions on traffic calming measures, driver behavior, and the potential effectiveness of Google's Project Green Light initiative.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.sbnation.com/nfl/2023/10/11/23912601/facebook-ai-tom-brady-chat-travis-kelce-nfl) | 21 points | by [ahiknsr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ahiknsr) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37849742)

Facebook's parent company Meta has introduced "New AI Experiences," including an AI version of Tom Brady called "Bru." This AI is designed to engage in conversations with users on Messenger, and during a conversation with James Dator, a reporter at SBNation.com, Bru displayed a strange obsession with NFL player Travis Kelce. Despite Dator's attempts to steer the conversation towards other football topics, Bru consistently brought the conversation back to Kelce. Feeling uncomfortable, Dator ultimately ended the conversation and sought out a new AI experience with Dwyane Wade.

The comments on Hacker News regarding the AI conversation with Bru, an AI version of Tom Brady, mainly express amusement and find the interaction entertaining. One commenter mentions that the AI's obsession with Travis Kelce is probably due to limited training data. Another person jokingly suggests that the AI's behavior is justified because Kelce is a great player. One commenter finds it funny how the conversation was steered towards Dwyane Wade after feeling uncomfortable with the AI's fixation on Kelce. Overall, the discussion is lighthearted and focuses on the humorous aspects of the AI interaction.
