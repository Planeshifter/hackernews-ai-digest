#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/how-were-helping-creators-disclose-altered-or-synthetic-content/) | 764 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [437 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39746468)

YouTube is introducing a new tool that will require creators to disclose when their content includes altered or synthetic media, such as generative AI, to provide more transparency to viewers. The disclosure will appear as labels in the video description or on the front of the video player, helping viewers understand if the content they are seeing could be mistaken for real. The goal is to strengthen trust between creators and their audience by ensuring transparency.

Creators will need to disclose content that uses the likeness of a realistic person, alters footage of real events or places, or generates realistic scenes. However, disclosures are not required for content that is clearly unrealistic, animated, includes special effects, or uses generative AI for production assistance. The labels will be rolled out across all YouTube platforms, with a more prominent label for videos on sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance.

While YouTube aims to give creators time to adjust to the new process, enforcement measures may be considered for those who consistently do not disclose information about altered or synthetic content. In some cases, YouTube may add a label to a video even if the creator has not disclosed it, especially if the content has the potential to confuse or mislead viewers. This initiative reflects YouTube's commitment to increasing transparency around digital content and collaboration with industry organizations like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

Furthermore, YouTube continues to work on an updated privacy process for requesting the removal of AI-generated or synthetic content that simulates identifiable individuals. Creators remain central to YouTube, playing a vital role in helping audiences navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI and technology.

After seven years of innovation and evolution, comma.ai's journey in developing self-driving technology has been a rollercoaster of ideas and solutions. The initial concept involved training a model to predict steering angles from images, but this approach failed to keep the car driving straight on highways due to accumulated errors. The team then introduced a model to predict lane positions, which served as a corrective measure for the steering angle model. However, the challenge of defining ground truth for lane lines led to further refinements in their system. Despite striving to eliminate reliance on lanes in their technology stack, the team found that some hand-coded assumptions were still necessary. They have since made significant progress in reducing this dependency, with openpilot being able to navigate dirt roads without lane lines by 2020. As they continue to evolve, comma.ai is revisiting behavioral cloning as a potential solution. The key lies in addressing the cumulative errors that affect the model's predictions over time, requiring an accurate estimator of accumulated errors to ensure effective driving behavior. By introducing a correction function that accounts for accumulated errors, comma.ai aims to achieve a more robust and reliable self-driving system. As they grapple with the challenge of establishing ground truth for this correction function within an end-to-end framework, the team's dedication to pushing the boundaries of autonomous driving technology remains unwavering.
