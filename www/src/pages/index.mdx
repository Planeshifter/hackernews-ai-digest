In a recent submission to arXiv (2403.04571), prominent researchers Yoshua Bengio and Nikolay Malkin explore the potential for creating an AI mathematician that transcends current capabilities in mathematical reasoning. While AI excels in language mastery, it still lags in complex reasoning tasks—a gap this essay seeks to address by delving into the cognitive processes of human mathematicians. 

The authors propose that modern deep learning techniques primarily engage system 1 abilities, which rely on intuition but fall short in system 2 capabilities that involve methodical reasoning and uncertainty management. Through an information-theoretical lens, they ponder what defines an intriguing mathematical statement and how this understanding could inform the design of AI systems that not only prove theorems but also generate novel conjectures. 

Their central thesis posits that a succinct set of theorems could effectively encapsulate a broader array of provable statements, offering a promising direction for future research in AI mathematics.
