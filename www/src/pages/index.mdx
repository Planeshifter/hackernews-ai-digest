#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/midjourney-copyright) | 17 points | by [YeGoblynQueenne](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=YeGoblynQueenne) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38896259)

Generative AI, which includes large language models (LLMs), has a visual plagiarism problem, according to a guest post on IEEE Spectrum. Recent research has shown that LLMs are capable of reproducing chunks of text from their training sets, including private information like email addresses and phone numbers. In some instances, LLMs have even produced near-verbatim outputs that can be seen as instances of plagiarism. This raises questions about how often these plagiaristic outputs occur and under what circumstances. Due to the black box nature of LLMs, researchers can only answer these questions through experimental methods. The existence of plagiaristic outputs has implications for technology, journalism, and copyright infringement laws.

The discussion about the submission covers various perspectives on the issue of visual plagiarism by language models. 
One user mentions that it would be challenging to guess the passwords to decrypt the compressed and separately encrypted copyrighted pictures, suggesting that generating plagiarized content may not necessarily infringe copyright. Another user argues that the responsibility for copyright infringement lies with the owners of the training data, not the models themselves.
Another user brings up the example of a young artist drawing a copyrighted character and suggests that drawing such characters could be seen as artistic training, rather than infringement. However, another user counters that the line between infringement and artistic expression can be blurry, especially with regards to the threshold of originality.
OpenAI's response to copyright issues is discussed, with one user suggesting that they could implement a system similar to Napster's extinction event to remove copyrighted content. However, others point out that many AI-generated works are small and have negligible impact on the original creators.
The concept of plagiarism is debated, with one user emphasizing that plagiarism involves taking credit for someone else's work. However, another user argues that training a child to draw copyrighted characters could be seen as condoning copyright infringement and refers to a hypothetical situation involving Planned Parenthood.
Overall, the discussion highlights the complexity of the issue and explores different viewpoints on the responsibility for plagiarism and copyright infringement in the context of generative AI.

In a recent article, Jared Edward Reser proposes a framework for building a thinking AI by simulating human-like thought processes. He focuses on replicating the dynamics of the mammalian working memory system, which features two forms of persistent activity: sustained firing and synaptic potentiation. Reser suggests that in an AI implementation, these two memory stores should be continuously and iteratively updated, with each state preserving a proportion of the coactive representations from the previous state. This iterative updating allows for the gradual evolution of concepts in working memory and the generation of associatively linked intermediate states, leading to progress towards a solution or goal. Reser conceptualizes iterative updating as an information processing strategy, a model of working memory, a theory of consciousness, and an algorithm for designing and programming artificial general intelligence. The article provides a comprehensive analysis of the framework, including literature review, implications, and suggestions for instantiating the model within a computer.

The discussion on Hacker News about the article proposing a framework for building a thinking AI focuses on various aspects of the proposal.
