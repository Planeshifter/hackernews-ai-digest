### Will supercapacitors come to AI's rescue?

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/supercapacitor-2671883490) | 46 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43908770)

The latest solution to manage the surging power demands of AI applications may lie in a surprising technological ally: supercapacitors. As AI training sessions coordinate through thousands of GPUs, they create energy spikes resembling those seen in the U.K.'s grid during major televised events, such as soccer matches when legions of kettle-activating Brits cause sudden electricity demands.

Addressing this strain on the power grid, several companies are deploying banks of supercapacitors in data centers. Unlike traditional batteries, which degrade rapidly when asked to handle these quantum leaps of energy requirement, supercapacitors can absorb and discharge energy swiftly without wearing out. They operate by storing a charge between two parallel plates, buffered by an electrolyte layer—a mechanism that navigates skillfully between the high-output demands of battery technology and the quick charge cycles seen in capacitors.

This approach promises a smoother energy demand on the grid while potentially cushioning the burden of the ever-expanding scale of AI workloads. As we aim to scale AI models—envisioned to be exponentially larger in the near future—these technological advances will be crucial in ensuring our infrastructure can keep up without going into overdrive or requiring excessive, energy-wasting 'dummy' calculations to maintain stability. With AI set to grow at an unprecedented rate, solutions like supercapacitors could be the key to sustainable and scalable growth.

The Hacker News discussion on using supercapacitors to manage AI-related power spikes highlights several key points and debates:

1. **Skepticism and Comparisons**:  
   - Some users question the premise, likening "dummy calculations" (used to smooth power demand) to the energy waste of cryptocurrency mining. Others humorously suggest combining AI training with crypto mining, though concerns about grid strain and regulatory intervention are noted.  

2. **Technical Solutions and Trade-offs**:  
   - **Supercapacitors vs. Batteries**: While supercapacitors excel at rapid charge/discharge cycles, users debate their practicality against lithium-ion batteries, which degrade faster but are more established. Some argue proper facility design (e.g., load balancing, compressed air systems) could mitigate spikes without new hardware.  
   - **Grid Infrastructure**: Challenges like demand charges (billed based on peak usage) incentivize data centers to smooth demand. Flywheels, UPS systems, and power factor correction are mentioned as alternatives.  

3. **AI Workload Dynamics**:  
   - Synchronized GPU operations in AI training create inherent spikes. Batch processing, delayed inference tasks (e.g., OpenAI’s cheaper "batch API"), and optimizing software to reduce synchronization delays are proposed to spread demand.  

4. **Economic and Regulatory Factors**:  
   - Large consumers face financial penalties for erratic power draw, pushing data centers to adopt load smoothing. Some note that utilities struggle with rapid demand shifts, as traditional power plants have slow ramp rates.  

5. **Humorous Takes and Sarcasm**:  
   - Jokes include renaming PyTorch to "pytorchpowerplant_no_blow_up" and mocking VC-funded startups that might "sell power load smoothing as a service."  

Overall, the discussion underscores a mix of technical pragmatism, skepticism toward hyped solutions, and recognition of the complex interplay between AI infrastructure and grid management.

In an exciting development for developers and data enthusiasts alike, VectorVFS introduces a novel approach to filesystem management by transforming a Linux system into a vector database. This innovative Python package leverages the native VFS (Virtual File System) extended attributes, allowing users to store vector embeddings directly alongside each file. This effectively turns your existing directory structure into a semantically searchable embedding store without the overhead of maintaining a separate index or external database.

VectorVFS supports Meta’s Perception Encoders (PE) and sets itself apart by outperforming other models like InternVL3 and SigLIP2 in zero-shot image tasks. It's designed to be lightweight and portable, using the native Linux VFS functions, thereby requiring no additional daemons, background processes, or databases.

The first release of VectorVFS focuses on image support and zero-overhead indexing, storing embeddings as extended attributes on each file, eliminating the need for external index files or services. Users can seamlessly perform search queries across their filesystems, retrieving files based on embedding similarity with ease. The system supports both CPU and GPU, although initial embedding on a large image collection can be time-consuming without GPU support.

Currently, VectorVFS primarily supports Perception Encoders and images, but the team behind it is working to expand support to more models and data types. The package is flexible, allowing for the integration of various embedding models, from pre-trained transformers to custom feature extractors.

For those intrigued by this cutting-edge tool, installation is straightforward with pip, and the package includes a user-friendly command-line interface for executing search queries across your filesystem.

#### [Submission URL](https://sixcolors.com/link/2025/03/shortcuts-is-falling-into-the-automation-gap/) | 102 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43892481)

In a thought-provoking piece on Club MacStories, John Voorhees delves into the state of Apple's Shortcuts app on the Mac, highlighting what he describes as its tumble into the "automation gap." This discussion harkens back to a piece he wrote nearly three years ago, pondering whether the integration of AppleScript into Shortcuts was a boon or a band-aid. Voorhees reflects on the integration and notes that rather than evolving into a robust automation tool for macOS, Shortcuts remains riddled with shortcomings, often requiring convoluted workarounds that ironically mirror its promise of simplicity.

Voorhees shares his recent experience in which he created a multi-layered automation sequence involving a Stream Deck, a Keyboard Maestro macro, a JavaScript script, Audio Hijack, and ultimately an AppleScript applet to execute a Shortcuts shortcut. While the sheer possibility of such integrations is a testament to the Mac's versatility, Voorhees critiques Apple's slow progress in advancing Shortcuts itself. He notes that these elaborate methods underscore the app's lack of development over recent years, with basic features like conditional statements still being fraught with issues. 

Despite Apple's ambitious declaration that Shortcuts would gradually transform into the "future of automation on the Mac," Voorhees suggests the clock is ticking for fulfilling this promise. The reliance on supplementary tools like AppleScript and Python suggests that the app is not yet the streamlined solution developers and users anticipated. With murmurs of App Intents potentially bridging some of these gaps, the Shortcuts app needs substantial refinement to live up to its original vision and truly become the powerhouse of automation it was meant to be.

Some note that security concerns have hindered Apple from expanding Shortcuts’ capabilities, leaving power users frustrated.

2. **Workarounds and Alternatives**:  
   Many share personal hacks, such as integrating Shortcuts with OpenAI’s LLMs, converting scanned PDFs, or using Home Assistant for smarter home automation. However, these solutions underscore Shortcuts’ inadequacies compared to Apple’s older tools (e.g., Automator) or platforms like Home Assistant, which offer deeper customization but require more effort.

3. **Apple’s Priorities**:  
   Commenters debate whether Apple’s consumer-focused model neglects power users. Some argue that Apple’s emphasis on simplicity and security has sidelined robust automation tools, with references to Apple’s shift away from scripting pioneers like Sal Soghoian. Others speculate that tighter HomeKit integration or AI (Apple Intelligence) could revive Shortcuts, but progress feels slow.

4. **Ecosystem Fragmentation**:  
   Users highlight inconsistencies, such as Shortcuts’ inability to toggle Wi-Fi hotspots or Bluetooth reliably, contrasting with macOS’s technical versatility. Critiques also extend to broader issues like Apple’s walled garden limiting third-party integrations, even as HomeKit and Home Assistant bridge some gaps.

   Nostalgia for Apple’s earlier automation tools (e.g., AppleScript) surfaces, with lamentations that Shortcuts’ promised “future of automation” remains unfulfilled. Some blame corporate decisions for deprioritizing developer-friendly tools in favor of mass-market appeal.

In summary, the community views Shortcuts as a tool with unmet potential—praised for its simplicity but criticized for lacking the depth and flexibility needed to evolve beyond basic tasks, especially as users increasingly turn to alternatives.

### Driving Compilers (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://fabiensanglard.net/dc/index.php) | 89 points | by [misonic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=misonic) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43891398)

In his insightful piece "Driving Compilers," Fabien Sanglard takes readers on a journey through the often overlooked and daunting world of compiling tools. Sanglard recounts his own struggles in transitioning from writing beautiful C and C++ code to turning it into executable files, a process less documented and frequently frustrating. While many books excel at teaching programming languages, they leave a gap when it comes to compiling, which is essential for bringing code to life.

To bridge this gap, Sanglard introduces a series aiming to demystify the compilation process. He doesn't focus on language nuances or building compilers from scratch; instead, he offers practical insights into converting source files into executables. Through his articles, Sanglard explains core concepts with practical, reproducible examples, using Linux's gcc and clang as case studies, though the principles apply across platforms.

The series is structured into five parts. It starts with an exploration of the compiler driver, the key component orchestrating the process. Then it dives into the stages of the compilation pipeline: the pre-processor (cpp), compiler (cc), linker (ld), and finally the loader. Each section meticulously dissects the tools' role in transforming code into an executable form, with each step backed by command-line demonstrations.

Sanglard's approach empowers developers to navigate the transition from code to binary with confidence, filling the literature gap that once left many, like himself, confused and frustrated. With this resource, developers can better handle those cryptic LNK errors and establish a solid foundation for their programming tools.

Improved educational resources now demystify these processes, contrasting older manuals with modern Microsoft or Borland guides.

2. **Linker Mechanics & Embedded Systems**:  
   *drguntmar* explained microcontroller bootloaders, where early linkers hardcoded addresses for simplicity. Subthreads compared this to modern ELF files and linker scripts, emphasizing their role in combining object files and managing memory. Writing bootloaders (e.g., for AVR chips or iPod Mini) was noted as a practical learning experience.

3. **Static vs. Dynamic Linking Trade-offs**:  
   *ntnvs* dissected differences: static linkers (C, Rust) resolve addresses at compile-time, while dynamic linking (C#, Java) at runtime adds flexibility but costs performance. *pjmlp* added that Go and Delphi avoid traditional UNIX linker issues via ahead-of-time compilation, highlighting language design impacts on toolchain reliability.

4. **Linker Errors & Toolchain Debates**:  
   Users debated linker errors stemming from symbol resolution (e.g., missing libraries). *vgr* simplified linkers as tools that merge sections and resolve symbols, while *tester756* and *brcj* pondered integrating linkers into compilers to streamline workflows.

Welcome to the future of crash analysis, where artificial intelligence dives deep into the world of debugging, breathing fresh life into one of the most enduring aspects of software development. This isn't just a case of polishing the dusty old Windows Debugger (WinDBG); it's a transformative leap into AI-powered system diagnostics, making the cumbersome process of analyzing crash dumps as easy as chatting over coffee.

Let's set the stage: in stark contrast to other tech fields that have soared ahead with groundbreaking innovations, crash dump analysis has remained surprisingly archaic. Developers in 2025 still find themselves tangled in a web of cryptic commands, meticulously deciphering stack traces and hex codes like digital archaeologists. But what if this painstaking process was replaced by a simple conversation with your debugger? Enter the groundbreaking integration of AI with crash analysis—an innovation that promises to revolutionize how we approach system errors.

In a dazzling demo, we witness this new reality in action: instead of navigating the labyrinthine maze of WinDBG, GitHub Copilot steps in as an AI assistant capable of analyzing crash dumps, pinpointing bugs, and even proposing automatic fixes. With capabilities like identifying which dumps are relevant and automatically sifting through multiple files, the tool redefines efficiency and precision in debugging.

But how was such wizardry accomplished? The magic lies in interlinking Microsoft's Console Debugger (CDB) with Model Context Protocol Servers (MCP), an open standard introduced in late 2024 by Anthropic. This protocol enables AI models to interact seamlessly with external tools, essentially giving AI the power to "conduct" software like a symphony. By setting up an MCP server for WinDBG (CDB), the AI can operate as a mediator, executing complex operations to deliver quick, comprehensible results.

The implications of this breakthrough stretch far and wide. For engineers, support staff, and quality assurance teams, this means less time wrestling with debug tools and more time solving critical issues. The complexity of interpreting assembly code or managing memory assessments—tasks that previously required specialist knowledge—becomes as accessible as flipping a switch.

In summary, integrating AI with crash dump analysis isn't just a novel convenience; it's a paradigm shift. As developers trade command-line drudgery for intelligent problem-solving, this innovation propels crash analysis into a futuristic realm where efficiency and ease of use are paramount, turning what was once considered digital archaeology into a seamless, automated conversation.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on AI-Powered Crash Analysis:**

The discussion highlights a mix of enthusiasm, technical insights, and skepticism about AI's role in revolutionizing crash dump analysis. Key points include:

1. **Comparisons to Existing Projects**:  
   - Users reference **ChatDBG**, an earlier LLM-driven debugging tool, noting its GitHub popularity (~75k downloads) and academic backing. This underscores existing momentum in AI-assisted debugging but also raises questions about novelty vs. iteration.

2. **Technical Nuances**:  
   - Integrating **language servers** (e.g., Microsoft’s Language Server Protocol) is praised for reducing token usage and improving answer quality by directly querying codebases. This avoids LLMs’ tendency for verbose, unstructured responses.  
   - Concerns arise about the **WinDBG/Python focus**, with users suggesting it may overlook broader Windows debugging needs. Alternatives like **lldb/gdb** are mentioned as established tools.

3. **Skepticism and Challenges**:  
   - While impressed by the demo, some doubt LLMs’ reliability for complex tasks. One user compares it to “wrapping CLI tools with AI”—useful but not groundbreaking without rigorous benchmarks.  
   - Security risks (e.g., Copilot accessing unencrypted passwords in memory) and the difficulty of debugging **distributed systems/business logic** (vs. trivial crashes) are highlighted as unresolved hurdles.

4. **Future Potential**:  
   - Optimists envision AI accelerating root-cause analysis in multi-service environments or via “observability engines” that correlate events. Others stress the need for deeper integration with debugging workflows (e.g., breakpoints, variable inspection).  
   - A recurring theme: AI should **augment, not replace**, developer intuition, especially in intricate scenarios requiring domain knowledge.

5. **Implementation Details**:  
   - The **MCP protocol** and CDB integration are dissected, with users noting how commands like `analyze -v` or `lm` are routed through AI. Some praise the approach for flexibility; others question scalability for kernel/driver-level crashes.

**Final Takeaway**:  
The community acknowledges AI’s potential to democratize crash analysis but emphasizes practicality—tools must prove reliable in real-world, complex scenarios. While the submission is seen as a promising step, it joins a landscape of existing projects and demands further validation. The blend of optimism and caution reflects broader debates about AI’s role in software engineering.
