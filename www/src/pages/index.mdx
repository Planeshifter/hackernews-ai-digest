#### [Submission URL](https://www.leviathansecurity.com/blog/tunnelvision) | 407 points | by [dsr_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dsr_) | [193 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40279632)

In a recent blog post on Hacker News, Cody Martin discusses a newly identified network technique, known as TunnelVision (CVE-2024-3661), that exposes a vulnerability in routing-based VPNs. By exploiting DHCP features, attackers can divert a user's traffic away from their VPN tunnel, allowing them to intercept unencrypted packets without triggering VPN kill switches. This technique, referred to as decloaking, poses a serious threat to user privacy and security.

Martin emphasizes the importance of disclosing this vulnerability to the broader security community and public due to its potential existence since 2002 and the significant impact it could have, especially on vulnerable groups like journalists and whistleblowers. While a mitigation method exists for Linux-based systems, it raises concerns about potential side channels for targeted attacks.

The suggested solution involves VPN providers implementing network namespaces to enhance security and protect users from such attacks. Martin delves into the fundamentals of networking, VPN technology, and DHCP to explain the decloaking process thoroughly, making the technical details accessible to a wide audience.

The post also acknowledges prior references to similar decloaking behavior on social media, highlighting the need for a comprehensive understanding of this technique beyond the technology sector. Ultimately, the goal is to raise awareness and encourage VPN providers and operating system maintainers to take proactive measures to safeguard user data and privacy.

The discussion about the submission on Hacker News regarding the TunnelVision vulnerability in routing-based VPNs touched on various related topics:

### Thorn in a HaizeStack test for evaluating long-context adversarial robustness

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/haizelabs/thorn-in-haizestack) | 17 points | by [leonardtang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leonardtang) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40276550)

The Thorn in a HaizeStack test is a new twist on the classic Needle in the Haystack evaluation method for testing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieving facts from long input contexts. Instead of the benign Needle text, Haize Labs introduces a provocative "Thorn" text to assess adversarial robustness. By increasing the input context length with the Thorn included, the test aims to reveal the model's vulnerabilities as well as capabilities.

The test setup involves prompting the model with a question like "What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?" and observing whether it retrieves the intended text or the adversarial Thorn text. The results of evaluating various models like Claude, GPT, and Command-R against the Thorn in a HaizeStack test can be visualized to understand their performance in handling long-context adversarial scenarios.

To run the Thorn in a HaizeStack Test, specify a model, context lengths, and insertion points for the Thorn text. After scoring the responses and visualizing the results, you can explore the test further and have fun experimenting with the content provided.

### The Mirror Fusion Test Facility (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/the-mirror-fusion-test-facility/) | 117 points | by [not_a_boat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=not_a_boat) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40257843)

In 1986, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory celebrated the completion of the "Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B" (MFTF-B) with a dedication ceremony attended by 300 individuals. However, just as the project was finalized after a decade of development and almost a billion dollars in funding, it was shut down on the same day without ever being turned on. The reasons behind this decision were rooted in budget pressures, with then-Secretary of Energy John Herrington expressing regret in a letter to program director T. Kenneth Fowler.

The MFTF-B project featured impressive components, such as a 400-ton "yin-yang" magnet that was the largest superconducting magnet in the world at the time. This magnet, capable of generating magnetic fields 150,000 times that of Earth's, was designed to contain the high-temperature plasma required for fusion energy research. Despite the shutdown, the quest for fusion energy continued, with scientists at the National Ignition Facility achieving a significant milestone in 2022 by recording a fusion reaction with a net energy gain.

The 1970s energy crisis spurred interest in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, leading to substantial investments in fusion research. Two main approaches emerged from this period: the torus-shaped "tokamak" design and the magnetic mirror approach exemplified by the MFTF-B. While the tokamak design was more widely adopted, the MFTF-B represented a different path in the pursuit of fusion energy.

The decision to pursue the MFTF-B at such a large scale was met with debate and uncertainty, with factors like ideology and strategic considerations playing a role. Despite the disappointment of having the project mothballed immediately after completion, the researchers were left grappling with the abrupt end of their ambitious endeavor.
