### Hallucinations in code are the least dangerous form of LLM mistakes

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Mar/2/hallucinations-in-code/) | 332 points | by [ulrischa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ulrischa) | [259 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43233903)

In a riveting discussion on Simon Willison's Weblog, the complexities and misunderstandings surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding are laid bare. A common grievance among developers using LLMs is the occurrence of "hallucinations," where the model fabricates methods or libraries that aren't real. While this might initially erode trust, Simon argues that these hallucinations are the least harmful type of errors one can encounter. The beauty of coding is that any invented methods are immediately spotlighted by compilers or interpreters, offering a simple fix path: either self-correct or let the LLM iterate on the error.

The real peril lies in errors that don't immediately show up, prompting the need for rigorous testing. Even seemingly flawless code can harbor hidden flaws. The antidote? A robust regimen of manual testing and code review‚Äîskills that won't be axed by the rise of LLMs.

For developers inundated with hallucinations, Willison suggests leveraging different models with better-aligned training data, harnessing the full potential of context windows, and choosing established technologies that LLMs are more familiar with.

Simon encourages developers to embrace the LLM learning curve, noting the importance of honing skills in reading and reviewing code efficiently. He also shares how he uses Claude‚Äôs ‚Äúextended thinking mode‚Äù for constructive feedback on his work, demonstrating a harmonious blend of AI and human expertise.

This discourse not only mitigates fears surrounding LLM coding errors but also champions a proactive, informed approach to integrating AI into software development. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or an AI novice, there‚Äôs food for thought‚Äîand skills to sharpen‚Äîin this insightful reflection.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges and nuances of integrating LLMs into coding workflows, particularly focusing on code reviews, productivity trade-offs, and broader implications. Key points include:

1. **Code Review Challenges**:  
   - Reviewing LLM-generated code is seen as fundamentally different from human-written code. While human code allows for social/technical knowledge transfer, LLM code lacks "empathy" and contextual decision-making, making reviews feel like negotiating with an opaque system.  
   - Skepticism exists about trusting LLM outputs, especially in unfamiliar domains, as models may generate plausible-looking but incorrect code (e.g., inventing methods or misaligning with project architecture).  

2. **Productivity vs. Maintenance**:  
   - Some users report LLMs boosting productivity (e.g., 20-30% faster coding) but note hidden costs in debugging and maintaining generated code.  
   - Over-reliance on LLMs risks creating codebases that are hard to understand without thorough documentation, tests, and conventions.  

3. **Testing and Constraints**:  
   - Logical flaws in LLM-generated code are harder to catch than syntax errors, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing, static analysis, and design constraints.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to Stack Overflow answers‚Äîincorrect solutions can gain traction if not critically reviewed.  

4. **Legal and Cultural Concerns**:  
   - LLMs might deliberately avoid certain outputs (e.g., song lyrics) due to copyright fears, leading to unhelpful or evasive responses.  
   - Debates arise about AI‚Äôs role in writing styles, with some arguing AI-assisted editing improves clarity, while others worry it erodes authenticity or cultural nuance.  

5. **Human Expertise Remains Critical**:  
   - Participants stress that understanding design intent, maintaining codebase consistency, and strategic decision-making still require human oversight. Tools like Claude‚Äôs "extended thinking mode" are praised for feedback but not replacements for deep comprehension.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects cautious optimism about LLMs as productivity aids but underscores the irreplaceable value of human judgment, thorough testing, and clear documentation. The consensus leans toward using LLMs as tools to augment‚Äînot replace‚Äîdeveloper expertise.

### Making o1, o3, and Sonnet 3.7 hallucinate for everyone

#### [Submission URL](https://bengarcia.dev/making-o1-o3-and-sonnet-3-7-hallucinate-for-everyone) | 255 points | by [hahahacorn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hahahacorn) | [208 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43222027)

In an interesting turn of events straight out of the tech world, a developer stumbled upon a peculiar syntax while helping a colleague troubleshoot some non-functional code. The issue? The colleague was using a non-existent syntax for preloading associations with conditions in Rails, inspired by a suggestion from ChatGPT.

The code in question was `User.includes(investments: -> { where(state: :draft) })`, a form that seemed intuitive but didn‚Äôt actually align with any known ActiveRecord feature. The developer‚Äôs curiosity led them down the rabbit hole, revealing that the syntax had stemmed from their own speculative post on a Rails forum two years prior. Despite its genesis in a lively API exploration discussion, the suggested method was flawed, much like a misremembered lesson from coding's formative years.

Oddly enough, this misleading guidance wasn't a solitary wander in the preliminary Void. The LLMs, or large language models like ChatGPT, were found to sometimes latch onto such niche suggestions, propagating them despite their absence from official documentation. The trip down memory lane reminded the developer of typical early-career tactics‚Äîspoiling coding elegance with copy-paste approaches gleaned from forums and questionable sources.

The episode offers a poignant reminder of the efficiency and pitfalls of AI-guided programming. While LLMs excel in many scenarios, their suggestions can veer into hallucinations without firm contextual grounding. Much like past developer experiences, they occasionally echo erroneous but endearing leaps into syntactic creativity. It's a gentle nudge to all developers: stay vigilant, fact-check AI suggestions, and embrace those adventurous programming dialogues with a healthy dose of skepticism.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores the dual-edged role of LLMs like ChatGPT in software development. Key points include:

1. **Efficiency vs. Errors**:
   - LLMs excel at generating **boilerplate code** and scaffolding, saving time on repetitive tasks. However, they frequently introduce bugs, incorrect syntax, or nonsensical changes (e.g., renaming variables, removing comments).
   - Critical code segments often require manual intervention, as LLMs struggle with **edge cases** and the final 10% of complex logic, leading to time-consuming debugging.

2. **Boilerplate vs. Abstractions**:
   - While useful for generic code, LLMs falter with meaningful **abstractions**. Users debate whether boilerplate is inherently bad or a necessary evil, noting that poorly designed abstractions can be worse than straightforward code.
   - Modern frameworks and libraries reduce boilerplate, but LLMs risk introducing "magic" code (e.g., dynamic reflection, monkey patching) that‚Äôs hard to maintain.

3. **Technical Debt & Best Practices**:
   - Overreliance on LLMs can lead to **technical debt**, especially when developers prioritize quick fixes over robust solutions. Static typing and code reviews are suggested as mitigations.
   - Concerns arise about AI-generated code passing reviews without proper testing, leading to latent issues in production.

4. **Use Cases & Limitations**:
   - LLMs are praised for aiding **beginners** (e.g., Arduino projects) but deemed unreliable for mission-critical systems.
   - Debugging AI-generated code remains challenging, with calls for better tooling (e.g., LSP integration) to catch errors early.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:
   - Skepticism exists around the "move fast, break things" ethos amplified by LLMs, with warnings about backward compatibility and maintainability in rapidly evolving projects.

**Takeaway**: LLMs are powerful assistants but require vigilant oversight. They democratize coding for novices and streamline repetitive tasks but risk propagating poor practices if unchecked. Balancing automation with critical thinking and robust testing is essential.

In a groundbreaking leap for the future of AI, a new paper titled "Infinite Retrieval: Attention Enhanced LLMs in Long-Context Processing" has been submitted on arXiv by Xiaoju Ye, Zhichun Wang, and Jingyuan Wang. The study tackles a major hurdle in the computational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) ‚Äî their limitations in handling inputs that exceed their context window size. This problem becomes particularly pronounced in tasks that involve retrieving and processing very long text inputs, like complex reasoning tasks.

The authors introduce a novel technique, InfiniRetri, which smartly leverages the inherent attention mechanisms of LLMs to accurately retrieve information from inputs of seemingly any length. This innovative method not only outperforms existing approaches by achieving 100% accuracy in a challenging "Needle-In-a-Haystack" test with over a million tokens, it also beats even larger models. Remarkably, InfiniRetri does this without imposing the substantial post-training costs typically needed to enhance long-context processing.

Moreover, the method significantly boosts performance on real-world benchmarks, reporting up to a 288% improvement without additional training or computational overheads. This advancement opens a new horizon for efficiently handling extensive texts through existing Transformer-based LLMs, vastly improving their practical applicability. With code expected to be released soon, this study not only sets a new state-of-the-art but signals an exciting direction for further enhancing AI's natural language processing abilities.

### 3,200% CPU Utilization

#### [Submission URL](https://josephmate.github.io/2025-02-26-3200p-cpu-util/) | 421 points | by [atomlib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atomlib) | [197 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43207831)

In a captivating tale of debugging adventure, a developer recounts their quest to unravel the mystery behind an astonishing 3,200% CPU utilization on their overloaded machine. Armed with Java 17's thread dumps featuring CPU time statistics, they embarked on a journey through a labyrinth of stack traces and buggy code to determine the source of their woe.

The root of the problem lay in an odd snippet of code within a function named `someFunction` in which an iteration loop over `unrelatedObjects` was erroneously performing operations solely on `relatedObject`. Despite reforming and testing this function, the issue persisted, suggesting deeper complexities at play.

Through sleuthing, the coder identified that a `TreeMap`, crucially unguarded by synchronization, was being accessed by multiple threads in parallel. This discovery led to an eye-opening experiment simulating high contention on the TreeMap. When subjected to multiple threads, the shared TreeMap sparked numerous exceptions and spiked CPU utilization‚Äîproof that the race conditions compromised not just data integrity but performance, leading to near-infinite computational loops.

Further digging and fascinating experiments revealed that in Java's Red-Black Tree implementation of TreeMap, such unchecked access could indeed form cycles, escalating the problem. Employing reflection, the developer exposed these cycles, granting a visceral insight into the havoc wreaked by unbounded concurrency.

This gripping debugging narrative not only highlights common pitfalls in multithreaded programming but also underscores the importance of protecting shared data structures with proper synchronization. For those intrigued by the full code exploration and reflection techniques, the author's GitHub repository holds the invaluable experiments, bringing more clarity to those navigating similar conundromes.

The Hacker News discussion explores the complexities of debugging concurrency issues, sparked by a developer‚Äôs discovery of a 3200% CPU spike caused by an unsynchronized Java `TreeMap`. Key themes and insights include:

1. **Concurrency Pitfalls**:  
   - The original issue stemmed from unsafe parallel access to a shared `TreeMap`, highlighting dangers of unsynchronized mutable state. Solutions like using `ConcurrentHashMap` or `Collections.synchronizedMap` were debated, though even these have caveats (e.g., thread safety at the collection level doesn‚Äôt protect individual operations or element integrity).  

2. **Immutable Data Structures**:  
   - Several users advocated for immutable data structures (as seen in Rust or functional programming) to eliminate shared-state concurrency problems. Functional approaches avoid side effects, simplifying multi-threaded logic.  

3. **Unexpected Bugs**:  
   - A typo placing `unrelatedObjects` into a `TreeMap` instead of `relatedObject` was noted as a potential root cause. However, fixes like "empty checks" were critiqued for not addressing thread safety.  

4. **Comparator/Comparable Risks**:  
   - Faulty `Comparator` implementations (e.g., violating *total order* contracts) can lead to infinite loops during sorting. Examples included Rust‚Äôs sorting algorithm breaking due to such issues and historical I/O Competition problems.  

5. **System Limitations**:  
   - Anecdotes about resource-constrained systems (e.g., old Sun servers with limited RAM) illustrated how concurrency bugs compound with I/O bottlenecks, leading to crashes or admin intervention.  

6. **Debugging Philosophy**:  
   - Users emphasized rigorous testing, transactional safeguards, and avoiding assumptions about thread safety. Tools like reflection (to inspect corrupted trees) and randomized testing (to detect comparator bugs) were championed.  

Ultimately, the discussion underscores the fragility of shared mutable state and the importance of synchronization, immutability, and defensive coding in multi-threaded environments.
