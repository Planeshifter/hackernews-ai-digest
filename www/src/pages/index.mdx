#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/17/with-11-9-million-in-funding-dottxt-tells-ai-models-how-to-answer/) | 25 points | by [cpfiffer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cpfiffer) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41883401)

In a recent development in the world of generative AI, startup Dottxt has secured $11.9 million in funding to tackle a significant hurdle faced by enterprises: the gap between AI and existing software engineering workflows. Led by the creators of the open-source project Outlines, Dottxt aims to bridge this gap by helping AI models produce coherent and structured outputs—essentially teaching AI to "speak computer."

The company uses a method known as structured generation, which shifts the focus from how users prompt models to how these models generate responses, making it easier for software engineers to integrate AI into their work. With a recent surge in demand for their open-source tool—over 2.5 million downloads—Dottxt is poised for growth, planning to expand its team and commercialize its offerings for enterprise clients within the next six months.

Dottxt's CEO, Rémi Louf, emphasizes that the focus is on unlocking real value from AI, a sentiment echoed by industry experts who believe structured generation could be pivotal for the future of language models. As more enterprises seek efficient AI solutions, Dottxt hopes to lead the charge in this exciting new category of AI technology.

In the discussion surrounding Dottxt's funding announcement on Hacker News, users exchanged thoughts on the implications of the company's approach to structured generation in AI. One user, "jrt," celebrated Dottxt's focus, suggesting that the structured generation method could significantly enhance the integration of AI into software engineering workflows. They compared Dottxt's efforts to existing technologies, mentioning that while it might not be perfect, it represents a step forward in AI's capabilities by making it easier for developers to utilize AI-generated outputs.

Another user, "cpfffr," pointed out that Dottxt's methods resonate perfectly with the development of complex software projects, emphasizing how the structured outputs can be beneficial, especially for those working with tools like GraphQL. They made a connection to ongoing advancements in other technologies, giving context to how Dottxt aligns with current trends in the tech space.

The discussion also included references to related projects and technologies, illustrating the broader landscape of AI development and how Dottxt’s contributions could influence future projects. Overall, while excitement surrounds Dottxt's structured generation technology, there are also nuances of caution regarding its implementation and comparisons to existing tools in the industry.

### LLMD: A Large Language Model for Interpreting Longitudinal Medical Records

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12860) | 47 points | by [troyastorino](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=troyastorino) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41878959)

A new large language model, LLMD, has been introduced to tackle the complex task of interpreting longitudinal medical records. Developed by a team led by Robert Porter, LLMD leverages a vast dataset that includes years of medical history across numerous care facilities, distinguishing itself with a nuanced understanding of patient health. 

The model's design encompasses both extensive pretraining on domain knowledge and fine-tuning based on specific tasks, allowing it to excel in structuring and abstracting medical data. Notably, LLMD outperforms not just earlier models but also larger general language models like GPT-4o on medical knowledge benchmarks, showcasing a remarkable accuracy that is relevant in real-world applications over mere performance on tests. 

By integrating a rigorous validation system, including expert audits, LLMD is tailored for practical use in healthcare, promising to enhance the analysis of patient data significantly. This innovative advancement is likely to shape the future landscape of medical AI and improve patient outcomes through better interpretation of complex medical histories.

The discussion on Hacker News around the new large language model LLMD highlighted its strong performance in analyzing real-world patient data and its effectiveness in answering complex medical queries. Several commenters pointed out that while LLMD shows improved accuracy on medical benchmarks compared to other models, there are lingering concerns regarding the reliability and safety of AI in clinical settings. One participant noted that, despite LLMD's enhancements, potential biases in clinical data and the inherent challenges of interpreting handwritten notes could pose risks. Another highlighted that while AI, including LLMD, can streamline the processing of medical records, a human element remains essential to ensure patient safety and uphold clinical standards. 

There were also discussions about the model's training methods, with some users questioning the transparency and reliability of its performance metrics. Comparisons with other AI models indicated that LLMD's capabilities are impressive, but several suggested that real-world implementation would require cautious validation processes due to potential real-life consequences. 

Overall, the conversation underscored optimism around LLMD's abilities while advocating for thorough checks to mitigate risks associated with deploying AI in healthcare.
