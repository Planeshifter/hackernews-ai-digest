### YouTube now requires to label their realistic-looking videos made using AI

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/intl/en-in/products/platforms/how-were-helping-creators-disclose-altered-or-synthetic-content/) | 764 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [437 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39746468)

YouTube is introducing a new tool that will require creators to disclose when their content includes altered or synthetic media, such as generative AI, to provide more transparency to viewers. The disclosure will appear as labels in the video description or on the front of the video player, helping viewers understand if the content they are seeing could be mistaken for real. The goal is to strengthen trust between creators and their audience by ensuring transparency.

Creators will need to disclose content that uses the likeness of a realistic person, alters footage of real events or places, or generates realistic scenes. However, disclosures are not required for content that is clearly unrealistic, animated, includes special effects, or uses generative AI for production assistance. The labels will be rolled out across all YouTube platforms, with a more prominent label for videos on sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance.

While YouTube aims to give creators time to adjust to the new process, enforcement measures may be considered for those who consistently do not disclose information about altered or synthetic content. In some cases, YouTube may add a label to a video even if the creator has not disclosed it, especially if the content has the potential to confuse or mislead viewers. This initiative reflects YouTube's commitment to increasing transparency around digital content and collaboration with industry organizations like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

Furthermore, YouTube continues to work on an updated privacy process for requesting the removal of AI-generated or synthetic content that simulates identifiable individuals. Creators remain central to YouTube, playing a vital role in helping audiences navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI and technology. The platform aims to empower human creativity while promoting transparency and responsible use of AI.

1. **jjcm** brings up the importance of starting small with AI and learning from it. They also mention potential legal issues and the necessity of clearly labeling altered content.
2. **OscarTheGrinch** discusses the complexities of AI classification, regulation, and the potential misuse of AI-generated content like deepfakes.
3. **lctrndd** points out the difficulty in discriminating between real and altered content using AI.
4. **AnthonyMouse** emphasizes the significance of trust in differentiating between real and altered events, as well as the prevention of misleading information.
5. **mzlx** discusses the technical aspects of verifying the authenticity of images or videos, mentioning cryptographic signatures and sensor data.
6. **rbrtlgrnt** acknowledges the existence of AI-generated content dating back to 1997.
7. **wptr** highlights the importance of focusing on content provenance to establish credibility and prevent misleading information.
8. Subsequent comments discuss the challenges of verifying authenticity in images or videos, potential technological solutions, and the importance of security measures in hardware-backed security and trusted execution environments.

### Are Voice AI Pipeline Platforms a Race to the Bottom?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.andrewoodleyjr.com/are-voice-ai-pipeline-platforms-a-race-to-the-bottom) | 9 points | by [andrewoodleyjr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andrewoodleyjr) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39719570)

The Voice AI landscape is evolving rapidly, with platforms offering developers pipelines for integrating voice, large language models, speech recognition, and transcription capabilities. However, a concerning trend of a race to the bottom in pricing is emerging. A recent case highlighted a team seamlessly migrating between platforms driven by better pricing, leading to the question: Is this a race to the bottom? The focus on pricing as the primary differentiator can lead to commoditization, neglecting the need for customization in Voice AI solutions. The "one-size-fits-all" approach limits flexibility and innovation. Platforms could start with competitive pricing to attract users, then develop tailored functionalities based on insights from real-world use cases to enhance products.

Rather than short-sighted price cuts, sustainable growth could be achieved by exploring innovative monetization strategies and refining products based on user feedback. This approach could position Voice AI platforms as attractive acquisition targets for enterprises looking to enhance their developer ecosystems.

In the discussion, there are different viewpoints shared regarding the race to the bottom in pricing within the Voice AI landscape. User "grvscl" highlights the trend of cost-driven products and the potential danger of moving towards almost zero marginal cost in producing software generally. They argue that by applying such a model to Voice AI products, there is a risk of compromising on quality. 

User "ndrwdlyjr" counters this argument by stating that the concept of a race to the bottom in pricing does not necessarily apply to all Voice AI platforms. They provide examples of how platforms like Twilio offer competitive pricing, and users who do not prefer Twilio may opt for alternatives like Vonage or Telynx due to different pricing structures. They also draw a comparison between Voice AI platforms and ride-sharing services like Lyft and Uber in terms of switching preferences.

User "gregw2" raises a question about specific Voice AI platforms being referenced in the discussion. "ndrwdlyjr" responds by suggesting that maintaining various platforms allows businesses and developers to build various voice products, citing examples of companies such as Vapiai, Blandai, Tomaso, Retell AI, Inferso, Marr Labs, and Eltoai as examples of platforms showcasing diversity in Voice AI offerings.

Additionally, user "drts" mentions Elevenlabs as a popular platform in this space.
