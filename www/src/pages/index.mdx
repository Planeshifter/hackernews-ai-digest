### Consistency LLM: converting LLMs to parallel decoders accelerates inference 3.5x

#### [Submission URL](https://hao-ai-lab.github.io/blogs/cllm/) | 411 points | by [zhisbug](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zhisbug) | [81 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40302201)

The blog post delves into the concept of Consistency Large Language Models (CLLMs), a novel approach to parallel decoding in Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditionally, LLMs decode sequences token by token, leading to high latency for longer responses.

### Did GitHub Copilot increase my productivity?

#### [Submission URL](https://trace.yshui.dev/2024-05-copilot.html) | 18 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40293461)

The author shares a candid reflection on their experience using GitHub Copilot for a year and then reverting to coding without it. While Copilot felt magical in generating code instantly, the author found that relying on it had its downsides. They discovered that Copilot's predictability was a major issue, often leading to unusable suggestions, as its AI logic differs significantly from human intuition. Additionally, Copilot's slower response time compared to a regular language server like clangd caused interruptions in their workflow, leading to wasted time in refining suggestions. Ultimately, the author concluded that despite Copilot's benefits in handling repetitive tasks, the tool did not enhance productivity due to these limitations.

The discussion on the submission about the author's experience using GitHub Copilot for a year and then reverting to coding without it involved various perspectives. 
1. **flyngspcshp** shared their experience of finding Copilot's suggestions initially magical but later realizing that blindly accepting its tips caused headaches and reduced functionality in coding. They pointed out that Copilot's slowness was a significant issue.
2. **mewpmewp2** raised concerns about the $10 monthly cost of Copilot and questioned its effectiveness in improving productivity. They emphasized the need to critically evaluate the tool's impact on productivity for the price paid.
3. **slmns** mentioned that Copilot was incredibly slow compared to other tools like Supermaven, highlighting the importance of faster suggestion generation in their workflow.
4. **grgjr** challenged the claim that LLMs (like Copilot) increase programmer productivity, expressing skepticism based on their 40+ years of experience in programming. They mentioned that while junior programmers might find AI coding tools like Copilot magical, senior programmers often see them as handy but not revolutionary.
5. **nnzzzs** mentioned that Copilot can sometimes provide unpredictable, incorrect, or silly suggestions, and its slowness can be a time-consuming factor. They highlighted the importance of time efficiency in coding tasks.

Overall, the discussion covered a range of viewpoints on GitHub Copilot, including its benefits, limitations, cost-effectiveness, and impact on productivity from the experiences of different users.
