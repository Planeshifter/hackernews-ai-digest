### The new skill in AI is not prompting, it's context engineering

#### [Submission URL](https://www.philschmid.de/context-engineering) | 789 points | by [robotswantdata](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=robotswantdata) | [443 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44427757)

In the rapidly evolving world of AI, a new buzzword is emerging: Context Engineering. This concept is reshaping how AI tasks are approached, shifting focus from mere "prompt engineering" to a more holistic strategy that emphasizes the importance of context. According to Tobi Lutke, it involves "the art of providing all the context for the task to be plausibly solvable by the LLM."

Why is this crucial? As AI agents become more integrated into our daily lives, their success depends less on technical code capabilities, and more on the quality of the context they're given. This involves several layers of information ‚Äì from initial instructions and user prompts to long-term memory and retrieved external knowledge. The blend of these elements determines if an AI agent is merely functional or ‚Äúmagical.‚Äù

Consider an AI assistant tasked with scheduling a meeting through a simple email. A basic model might respond mechanically, failing to engage meaningfully. But a context-rich model, equipped with calendar data, past interactions, and communication tools, can create a nuanced, efficient response that feels genuinely helpful.

The heart of Context Engineering is constructing dynamic systems that provide relevant information and tools at precise moments. Unlike static prompts, this approach requires continuous tailoring and refinement, ensuring the AI model is not hampered by lackluster input.

In essence, crafting effective AI solutions now hinges on mastering Context Engineering. It's about optimizing the flow of critical information, ensuring that AI agents have everything they need to perform tasks with precision and insight. This discipline is becoming paramount for those looking to push the boundaries of what AI can achieve, moving from basic functionality to truly transformative applications.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around Context Engineering reflects both enthusiasm and skepticism, with key debates and insights:

1. **Technical Insights:**
   - **Model Performance:** Users noted that larger models (32B+) handle extended contexts (e.g., 60K tokens) more reliably than smaller ones. Tools like Claude and Gemini demonstrate improved accuracy with structured context, such as compressing key info into summaries or JSON/YAML formats.
   - **Context Limits:** Effective context often falls within 7‚Äì12 lines (~1K tokens), and exceeding this risks degraded recall. Techniques like breaking tasks into smaller agents/tools or using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) help manage constraints.

2. **Terminology Debates:**
   - **"Engineering" vs. Hype:** Some dismissed "Context Engineering" as rebranded prompt engineering or QA practices, arguing it lacks rigorous scientific principles. Others defended it as a systematic approach to structuring context, akin to traditional engineering.
   - **System Prompts vs. User Input:** Users debated whether system prompts (e.g., instructions) are fundamentally different from conversational context, noting models may process them separately.

3. **Practical Tips:**
   - **Structured Data:** Formatting data in Markdown, JSON, or YAML improves reliability. For example, structuring email threads as tables helps models parse information.
   - **Incremental Refinement:** Testing, iterative prompt adjustments, and validating outputs were emphasized over relying on deterministic solutions.

4. **Critiques:**
   - **Overpromising:** Some criticized the AI industry for marketing buzzwords like "Context Engineering" to mask limitations. Others stressed that LLMs inherently lack true understanding, making context a heuristic workaround.
   - **Tool vs. Magic:** While context-rich systems boost accuracy (e.g., 70% ‚Üí 95% for Claude), users cautioned against treating LLMs as "magic" solutions. Success depends on methodical design, not just extensive context.

**Consensus:** Context Engineering is seen as a valuable evolution in AI design, focusing on dynamic, structured information flow. However, its efficacy hinges on pragmatic execution‚Äîavoiding hype, leveraging model strengths, and acknowledging limitations. The term itself sparks debate, but the core idea aligns with optimizing inputs for more reliable outputs.

### There are no new ideas in AI, only new datasets

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-are-no-new-ideas-in-ai-only) | 460 points | by [bilsbie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bilsbie) | [252 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44423983)

Join us on a journey through the evolution of AI as narrated by Jack Morris in his thought-provoking piece, "There Are No New Ideas in AI‚Ä¶ Only New Datasets." Morris dives into the heart of AI's progress over the past decade and a half, suggesting that while innovative ideas seem to have plateaued, it's the continual discovery and utilization of new datasets that are truly driving advancements.

Amid an era of exponential growth akin to a "Moore's Law for AI," Morris challenges the common narrative that breakthroughs come solely from fresh ideas birthed in academia and industry powerhouses like MIT, Stanford, and Google. Instead, he argues, the linchpin of innovation is often these treasure troves of data that empower existing techniques.

Morris takes us through the landmarks of AI evolution: the rise of Deep Neural Networks inspired by AlexNet's triumph in 2012, the transformative introduction of transformers like BERT and GPT from 2017 onwards, the incorporation of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) in 2022, and the frontiers reached by reasoning models in 2024. Each of these milestones, Morris emphasizes, is rooted in leveraging new, vast datasets, whether it's labeled image databases or the sprawling text of the internet.

In his analysis, Morris suggests we search for the next AI breakthrough not in unprecedented concepts but in fresh applications of longstanding methods coupled with untapped data sources. As AI models continue becoming smarter and more efficient with each passing year, it seems the secret to future innovation lies not in reinventing the wheel but in unleashing the potential of data yet to be fully explored.

For those intrigued by AI's journey and its ever-unfolding future, Morris' piece acts as a guide, underlining the importance of viewing datasets as the true catalysts for next-gen AI breakthroughs.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Jack Morris's article, *"There Are No New Ideas in AI‚Ä¶ Only New Datasets,"* expands on the limitations and future directions of AI, emphasizing several key themes:

### 1. **Multimodal Integration vs. Current AI Limitations**  
Participants argue that human intelligence‚Äôs richness stems from multimodal inputs (touch, smell, motor skills, emotions), which current models like LLMs and vision transformers lack. Users highlight that AI‚Äôs focus on text and images overlooks critical sensory data (e.g., texture, temperature, proprioception) essential for understanding the physical world. For instance, one commenter notes how infants explore through tactile interaction, a gap in AI‚Äôs "disembodied" learning.

### 2. **Abstraction vs. Embodiment**  
Debates arise over language‚Äôs role as an abstraction of sensory input. While some argue language inherently captures higher cognition, others counter that true intelligence requires *embodiment*‚Äîphysical interaction with the world. A subthread even likens programming languages (e.g., Java) to "lower cognitive functions," suggesting that abstract models alone (like LLMs) struggle to replicate grounded reasoning or intuitive physics without sensory integration.

### 3. **Compute vs. Datasets**  
A counterpoint challenges Morris‚Äôs emphasis on datasets, proposing that hardware advancements and computational power (e.g., Transformers‚Äô scalability) have driven progress more than data. One user argues that even with 20-year-old datasets, modern compute could yield breakthroughs, questioning whether truly "new ideas" are needed if hardware continues to improve. However, others doubt scaling current models without 10‚Äì100x compute gains.

### 4. **Dynamic Learning and Memory**  
Critiques of LLMs‚Äô static training cycles emerge, contrasting them with human neuroplasticity and real-time learning. Users stress the need for AI systems that adapt dynamically, retain/forget memories contextually, and incorporate feedback loops‚Äîtraits current models lack. Forgetting is paradoxically noted as *useful* for filtering noise, suggesting machines might need similar mechanisms.

### 5. **Beyond Language Models**  
While LLMs dominate headlines, commenters urge attention to underappreciated AI frontiers: robotics, audio processing, and simulations. Progress in these areas, though less hyped, could integrate multisensory data (e.g., lidar, haptics) and bridge the gap between digital models and physical understanding.

### Conclusion  
The discussion amplifies Morris‚Äôs thesis but complicates it: while datasets are crucial, participants stress that *embodied, multimodal experiences* and hardware advances are equally vital for next-gen AI. Language and vision alone may abstractly mimic human cognition, but true breakthroughs might require richer sensory integration, dynamic learning, and a shift beyond the current LLM paradigm.

5. **Browser Ecosystem Dynamics**:  
   - Mozilla‚Äôs dependence on Google funding and Apple/Google‚Äôs conflicting incentives (privacy vs. tracking) shape how browsers handle anti-bot measures.  

The discussion underscores a tension: while BotID offers streamlined bot protection, its methods risk sacrificing **user privacy** and accessibility, sparking debate over where to draw the line between security and an open web.

### Scribble-based forecasting and AI 2027

#### [Submission URL](https://dynomight.net/scribbles/) | 53 points | by [venkii](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=venkii) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44424996)

The article on Dynomight ponders the challenge of forecasting, focusing particularly on the possibility that artificial general intelligence (AGI) could arrive as early as 2027. It explores the traditional methods of predicting future events, contrasting intuition-based forecasts with math-based models. The author dives into the complexity of models like those used for climate change forecasts, where enormous amounts of data and numerous interacting variables create a robust, though data-intensive, prediction framework.

On the other hand, forecasting something as nebulous as AGI involves a lot more guesswork and fewer well-defined rules. While intuition might often be criticized in forecasting due to its subjective nature, the article argues that math-based forecasting isn‚Äôt devoid of arbitrary assumptions either; it just hides them under layers of calculations. The piece suggests a balance between intuition and mathematics might be necessary, leaning on ‚Äòscribble-based forecasting‚Äô‚Äîa playful method of drawing intuitive connections on data as a personal favorite approach.

Central to this discussion is the AI 2027 forecast, which predicts AGI based on current AI capabilities in performing various tasks. The forecast model used in the article suggests that if AI can handle tasks equivalent to those a human could complete in a significantly long time frame (from one month to ten years), we‚Äôre nearing AGI. The prediction relies on the AI reaching a high success rate in these tasks, aiming for an 80% completion rate.

Ultimately, the article is a mix of philosophical inquiry and technical discussion, challenging readers to question the validity and reliability of various forecasting methods, especially when predicting something as transformative as AGI. It leaves an open-ended query about the role of both intuitive and mathematical strategies in trying to foresee complex, potentially world-altering developments.

Hidden assumptions and arbitrary axis scaling (e.g., linear vs. logarithmic) can distort predictions, making extrapolations misleading. Critics note that models might overfit data or lack prior plausibility, especially for AGI.

2. **AGI 2027 Prediction**:  
   - The 2027 timeline is dismissed by some as overly simplistic or sci-fi-like. Concerns include dependencies on unpredictable factors (e.g., political decisions, funding) and the absence of evidence for recursive self-improvement in AI systems. A linked paper ([arXiv:2506.22419](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22419)) suggests current AI shows poor self-improvement capabilities, though others counter that future AI-driven research breakthroughs could accelerate progress.

3. **Methodological Debates**:  
   - Some defend the "scribble" method as a flexible, qualitative tool for exploring hypotheses, while others favor probabilistic approaches (e.g., Monte Carlo simulations) or William Briggs‚Äô focus on observable probabilities. The balance between subjective intuition and quantitative rigor is emphasized, with warnings against treating models as infallible.

4. **External Factors**:  
   - Broader societal and technical challenges‚Äîdata silos, AI alignment, and geopolitical risks‚Äîare noted as potential roadblocks to AGI. The discussion underscores the difficulty of forecasting amid such complexity.

### I deleted my second brain

#### [Submission URL](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain) | 529 points | by [MrVandemar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MrVandemar) | [324 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44402470)

In a bold move against the tide of digital hoarding, Joan Westenberg recently erased her entire "second brain"‚Äîa meticulously curated collection of over 10,000 digital notes compiled over seven years. This vast trove of insights, quotes, and ideas, stored in systems like Obsidian and Apple Notes, was meant to enhance her productivity and creativity by capturing every fleeting thought. However, it became clear that instead of empowering her, it had turned into an oppressive weight stifling her curiosity and genuine thought processes.

The concept of a "second brain," popular among productivity enthusiasts, promises clarity and enhanced memory by externalizing and organizing one's thinking into a digital network. Yet, Westenberg found this system morphed into a mausoleum of past ideas and identities, diminishing her mental agility and curiosity. In her reflective journey, largely influenced by her sobriety milestones, she realized that true progress came not from archived notes but from lived experiences and personal evolution.

Citing cultural and psychological insights, Westenberg critiques the misconception that human memory functions like static data storage. Human cognition, she argues, thrives on the chaos and fluidity of life, not on rigidly categorized files. The promise of total capture through Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems often results in stored but unreflected upon ideas, creating an illusion of mastery without true understanding.

Furthermore, she addresses the guilt associated with unread reading lists, recognizing that her vast database of unread material served more as a monument to her ambitions than as a roadmap to wisdom. By letting go of this digital excess, Westenberg embraces a more organic and improvisational approach to learning and growth, one that favors true engagement over mere accumulation.

This act of digital decluttering, she suggests, is a liberating release from the tyranny of productivity tools that can ensnare their users. By returning to a simpler state of mental inquiry and presence, Westenberg champions the value of forgetting as a natural and necessary aspect of genuine knowledge and self-discovery.

In a world obsessed with capturing and categorizing, Westenberg‚Äôs story is a refreshing reminder of the power of letting go and trusting one's instincts to guide learning and creativity.

   A tangential thread debated long-term data storage, with users comparing HDDs, SSDs, and magnetic tape (LTO). Tape was noted for its cost-effectiveness and durability for archival purposes, though some questioned its practicality versus cloud storage or periodic data migration.

4. **Psychological Reflections**:  
   Participants explored the emotional weight of digital hoarding, comparing it to physical clutter. Some argued that retaining vast amounts of data creates a "psychological burden," while others admitted struggling with the fear of losing potentially valuable information. The act of decluttering was framed as a way to reclaim mental space and focus on the present.

5. **Nostalgia vs. Progress**:  
   A few users defended revisiting old notes or journals, citing the joy of rediscovering past perspectives. One mentioned how revisiting a 20-year-old HTML project sparked creativity. However, others countered that overly fixating on the past hinders growth, with one quipping, "Sometimes it‚Äôs nice to remind yourself you‚Äôve [already] lived."

6. **Humor and Skepticism**:  
   Lighthearted critiques emerged about AI-generated comments (noting their "poetic but hollow" style) and the irony of productivity systems becoming distractions. One user joked that obsessive note-taking often feels like "insight hoarding" rather than genuine learning.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a tension between the desire to capture knowledge and the freedom of letting go. While some advocate for structured systems, many resonate with Westenberg‚Äôs conclusion: true growth often lies in lived experience, not archived data. As one user succinctly put it: "Human brains thrive on chaos, not categorization."
