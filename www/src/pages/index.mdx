In a startling revelation, an investigative report by +972 Magazine and Local Call uncovers the existence of an artificial intelligence system known as "Lavender" used by the Israeli army during the recent conflict in the Gaza Strip. Developed to identify targets for military strikes, Lavender marked thousands of Palestinians as potential militants, leading to a wave of deadly airstrikes, predominantly targeting individuals in their homes, even with their families present. Operating with minimal human oversight, Lavender was given broad authority early in the conflict, with military personnel treating its decisions almost like those of a human commander. Despite known errors in the system's targeting, little verification was done before approving bombings, resulting in civilian casualties. The army also used another AI system called "Where's Daddy?" to track and execute targeted individuals in their residences.

The report highlights the alarming impact of AI technology on military operations, with the preference for unguided munitions causing widespread destruction and loss of civilian lives. The military's authorization to permit significant collateral damage during strikes on low-ranking militants further underscores the devastating consequences of relying on automated systems for decision-making in warfare. The revelation of Lavender's role in the conflict sheds light on the complex ethical and moral implications of AI in military strategies, prompting scrutiny and debate on the use of such technology in modern warfare.
