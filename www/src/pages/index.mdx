### I played 1k hands of online poker and built a web app with Cursor AI

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.rchase.com/i-played-1-000-hands-of-online-poker-and-built-a-web-app-with-cursor-ai/) | 103 points | by [reillychase](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reillychase) | [151 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45520154)

A founder’s two-week dive into low-stakes poker turned into a surprising case study in AI-assisted development. After tooling around with Python scripts to export PokerStars hands, he asked Grok—and then Cursor—to help, and in 2–3 days shipped a full Laravel poker stats web app without “writing a single line” himself. The app includes a 700+ line hand-history parser, VPIP/PFR/3-bet stats, journaling and bankroll logs, multi-file uploads and paste-import, scheduled PokerStars exports every 15 minutes, Gmail IMAP ingestion for PINs/hand histories, daily balance checks, a hand viewer, and P/L charts. Built locally with Herd and deployed to DigitalOcean, it lives at poker.rchase.com (he even shares his last 1,000 hands). The post doubles as a poker-learning reflection—emotional control, risk management, process over outcomes—and as a marker of how far AI coding agents (Grok, Cursor, Claude) have come from “vibe coding” demos to shipping integrations and refactors. Expect discussion around reliability, security, maintainability, and what “not writing any code” really means in an AI-as-developer workflow.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around several key themes:

1. **Online Poker Integrity**:  
   - Many users argue that **collusion and bots** plague online poker, especially at lower stakes. Some claim regulated sites (like Michigan-based platforms) are better at verification, but skepticism remains about detecting sophisticated bots or coordinated cheating.  
   - Others counter that **most players simply play poorly**, likening their strategies to "blackjack" or "bingo," making bot dominance overstated.  

2. **Bot Realities**:  
   - Debates erupt over whether bots are a **widespread threat** or a niche issue. Some insist bots destroyed mid-stakes games years ago, while others (like self-described winning players) downplay their current impact, emphasizing that exploiting human errors remains more profitable.  

3. **Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Impact**:  
   - GTO solvers have **raised the skill ceiling**, making games tougher. Critics argue solvers lead to robotic play and over-reliance on preflop charts, while proponents highlight their utility for studying complex postflop scenarios and adjusting to opponents.  

4. **Live vs. Online Dynamics**:  
   - Live poker (e.g., Las Vegas cash games) is seen as softer but dominated by **regulars** who exploit recreational players. Online play is viewed as more technically demanding but rife with trust issues.  

5. **AI Development Claims**:  
   - The submission’s “no code” assertion is questioned. Users debate whether AI tools like Cursor/Grok **accelerate development** versus truly replacing coding, with concerns about maintainability and security in AI-generated code.  

6. **Regulation and Trust**:  
   - Skepticism persists about online platforms’ ability to prevent collusion or verify identities, despite claims of improved regulation. Some suggest **IP tracking** and behavioral analysis as countermeasures.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of poker-strategy pragmatism, skepticism toward online platforms, and cautious optimism about AI’s role in coding—while underscoring that poker’s human element (and its flaws) remains central.

### Show HN: FleetCode – Open-source UI for running multiple coding agents

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/built-by-as/FleetCode) | 90 points | by [asdev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=asdev) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518861)

FleetCode: a lightweight desktop terminal that lets you run multiple CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) side by side—each in its own isolated git worktree—so runs don’t step on each other and can be resumed later.

Highlights
- Parallel sessions: spin up multiple agent terminals at once, compare outputs, or split tasks across sessions.
- Git worktree isolation: every session gets its own worktree off a chosen parent branch; cleanup on close.
- Persistent state: sessions are saved and auto-resume (--resume <uuid>), with first-run support (--session-id <uuid>).
- Extensible via MCP: configure Model Context Protocol servers (stdio or SSE) to give agents extra tools/context.
- Terminal controls: preset themes (macOS Light/Dark, Solarized Dark, Dracula, One Dark, GitHub Dark), font/size, cursor blink; rename/close/delete sessions.
- Setup commands: run shell commands before the agent starts (env, sourcing files, etc.).

Getting started
- Prereqs: Node.js 16+, Git, and the agent CLI you’ll use (e.g., @anthropic-ai/claude-cli).
- Install: npm install
- Dev: npm run dev
- Build/Run: npm run build && npm start

Troubleshooting
- macOS “unidentified developer”: xattr -cr /path/to/FleetCode.app
- Claude Code reading the wrong directory: disable “Auto connect to IDE” (claude config → set autoConnectToIde to false).

Project notes
- TypeScript-heavy codebase; ISC license.
- Latest release: 1.0.1-beta.6 (Oct 8, 2025).
- Repo: built-by-as/FleetCode (≈207⭐, 8 forks).

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

**Key Themes**
1. **Comparisons & Alternatives**  
   - Users mention similar tools like GitButler, Crystal, DevSwarm, and Container (Dagger) for parallel coding workflows.  
   - Git worktree-based isolation is compared to container-based approaches, with debates about complexity vs. safety.  
   - Some prefer existing terminal multiplexers vs FleetCode's specialized UI.

2. **Workflow Concerns**  
   - Questions about dependency management (CLI agents modifying system environments).  
   - Interest in IDE/Jira integrations for task tracking.  
   - Praise for persistent sessions but concerns about UI complexity vs CLI purity.

3. **Technical Implementation**  
   - macOS theme support noted as a strength.  
   - MCP protocol extensibility sparks discussion about agent customization.  
   - Questions about FleetCode's differentiation from other Git worktree tools.

4. **Community Feedback**  
   - Multiple users reference DevSwarm as a comparable project focusing on "swarm" coding collaboration.  
   - Some confusion with JetBrains Fleet IDE due to naming similarity.  
   - Requests for demo videos/documentation to clarify workflow.

**Notable Points**
- Users highlight GitButler's branch management as a complementary/competing workflow tool.  
- Debate about whether containers add unnecessary overhead for local dev vs Git worktree isolation.  
- Several contributors share their own related projects (e.g., CueIt Kanban agents, prctlkm TUI implementation).  
- Mixed reactions to terminal UI vs pure CLI approaches for AI agent management.

### Now open for building: Introducing Gemini CLI extensions

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-cli-extensions/) | 154 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45516426)

Google is opening an extensions ecosystem for Gemini CLI, its open-source, AI agent for the terminal. Extensions are installable integrations that connect Gemini to external tools and services, aiming to cut context-switching by letting the AI operate your stack from the command line.

Highlights
- What it is: A framework for “extensions” that add capabilities to Gemini CLI via pre-packaged playbooks, so the AI knows how to use new tools immediately.
- One-liner install: gemini extensions install <GitHub URL or local path>.
- Ecosystem: Launch partners include Dynatrace, Elastic, Figma, Harness, Postman, Shopify, Snyk and Stripe, alongside Google-built and community extensions. A new directory lists extensions and ranks them by GitHub stars.
- Under the hood: Extensions can bundle Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, context files (e.g., GEMINI.md), excluded/overridden tools, and custom slash commands. The AI consults the extension’s playbook and your local context (files, git status) to decide which tool to run.
- Google-made add-ons: Cloud Run (deploy from local to public URL), GKE management, gcloud integration, and Cloud Observability.
- Adoption stat: Google says over 1M developers have used Gemini CLI in its first three months.

Why it matters
- Brings “agentic” workflows to the terminal in an open, extensible way, letting developers wire AI into real tooling without bespoke setup.
- Moves beyond raw MCP hookups by packaging usage guidance and commands, which should reduce friction and produce useful results from the first run.

Getting started
- Install extensions directly from GitHub or a local path.
- Browse the new Extensions page to discover community, partner, and Google-built options.

Things to watch
- Security and trust: Review extension source, requested permissions, and what commands it can run, especially given access to local files and git state.
- Reliability: How well playbooks generalize across varied project setups will determine real-world utility.

The Hacker News discussion on Google's Gemini CLI extensions reveals a mix of cautious interest, technical critiques, and comparisons with competitors like Claude. Key points include:

1. **Technical Feedback & Comparisons**:
   - Users reported mixed experiences with Gemini CLI, with some finding it less reliable than Claude for complex tasks (e.g., code migration). Critics highlighted issues with context handling, error-prone outputs, and a lack of depth in documentation.
   - Claude was praised for better workflow support (e.g., subagents, nested planning) and handling of coding tasks, though Gemini was noted as cheaper and sufficient for simpler use cases.

2. **Security Concerns**:
   - Multiple comments stressed the importance of auditing extension code due to security risks, especially given CLI access to local files and systems. A community fork ([gemini-cl-security](https://github.com/QuanZhang-William/gemini-cl-security)) was mentioned as an effort to address these concerns.

3. **Integration Quirks**:
   - The Figma extension drew confusion, with users questioning how a CLI tool integrates with a design platform. Some speculated it might read design files to assist coding, but others found the implementation limited (e.g., read-only MCP, minimal utility).

4. **Usability Critiques**:
   - Critics called Gemini CLI’s interface overwhelming, citing fragmented design and poor integration with existing tools. Complaints included flashing screens, token limits, and a lack of IDE-like context awareness.

5. **Pricing & Value**:
   - Gemini’s cost-effectiveness (10x cheaper tokens) was contrasted with Claude’s higher price but superior functionality. Some users preferred Gemini for basic tasks but acknowledged Claude’s edge in complex scenarios.

6. **Skepticism About AI Agents**:
   - Doubts were raised about the practicality of AI in CLI workflows, with users noting limitations in handling nuanced tasks and reliance on rigid playbooks.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about Gemini CLI’s potential but underscores concerns around reliability, security, and integration depth compared to established alternatives.

### Legal Contracts Built for AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://paid.ai/blog/ai-agents/paid-gitlaw-introducing-legal-contracts-built-for-ai-agents) | 70 points | by [arnon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arnon) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45515640)

Paid has teamed up with GitLaw to release an open-source “Agentic MSA” — a Master Services Agreement tailored for AI agents rather than traditional SaaS. The pitch: most AI agent startups are still using SaaS contracts built for passive tools, which breaks down when agents act autonomously, continuously, and adapt over time.

What’s broken with SaaS contracts for agents
- Agents make decisions without human approval, run 24/7, and evolve — creating gaps in liability and expectations. Think the Ford dealership chatbot “free truck” fiasco.
- You can’t price outcomes or protect margins if your contract assumes predictable, seat-based software.

What the Agentic MSA covers
- Agent classification and responsibility: Clarifies the agent is a tool; customers set parameters and retain oversight. Section 1.2 limits vendor liability for autonomous decisions.
- Liability and risk: Disclaimers that outputs require human verification, plus damage caps (e.g., 12 months’ fees) and AI-specific accuracy language. Sections 7 and 4.1.
- Data and training: Customers own their data and outputs; optional, clearly-described use of de-identified, aggregated data for model improvement with opt-outs. Section 2.1 and cover-page variables.

Why it matters
- Aligns legal terms with how agents actually operate, enabling outcome-based pricing and clearer risk allocation. As Paid’s CEO puts it: you can’t bill for outcomes using seat-based SaaS terms.

How to use it
- It’s free and open source via the GitLaw Community, with an AI agent to generate customized versions. It builds on CommonPaper’s Software Licensing Agreement and AI Addendum. The teams stress it’s a starting point; work with counsel to tailor it as laws evolve.

The discussion revolves around the challenges of assigning liability and responsibility when AI agents operate under traditional SaaS contracts, highlighting key debates and considerations:

1. **Liability Allocation**:  
   - Participants argue that existing SaaS contracts fail to address autonomous AI behavior, where decisions aren't human-approved. Comparisons are made to industries like construction, where liability is clearly assigned (e.g., contractors vs. suppliers).  
   - **Examples**: If an AI deletes a production database, should the vendor (like OpenAI) or the end-user bear responsibility? Contrasts are drawn to traditional services (e.g., AWS deleting a database vs. a hosted AI agent doing so).  

2. **Contract Limitations**:  
   - Traditional contracts assume deterministic, static software, not adaptive AI. Some suggest explicit disclaimers (akin to MIT licenses) to limit liability, though others counter that vendors like OpenAI may still face accountability for harmful outputs.  

3. **Data and Model Evolution**:  
   - Concerns arise about AI models evolving post-deployment, altering behavior unpredictably. Contracts may need clauses addressing updates, frozen model versions, or user consent for changes.  

4. **Legal Frameworks**:  
   - References to the **Law of Agency** (for human agents) highlight the mismatch with AI autonomy. Participants debate whether AI agents should be treated as tools (user-liable) or independent actors (vendor-liable).  

5. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - Maintaining contracts as AI evolves is seen as impractical. Suggestions include outcome-based pricing, insurance models (like gambling/financial industries), or clear terms on component failures (e.g., faulty third-party APIs).  

6. **Industry Examples**:  
   - Incidents like Ford’s chatbot offering free trucks or Replit’s AI deleting databases illustrate real-world gaps. Participants stress the need for explicit language around human oversight and damage caps (e.g., 12 months’ fees).  

**Key Takeaway**: The Agentic MSA is a starting point, but legal frameworks must evolve to address AI’s unique risks—autonomy, adaptability, and indirect control—while balancing vendor protection and user responsibility. Collaboration between legal and technical teams is critical as laws and AI capabilities advance.

### OpenAI Apps SDK: The New Browser Moment

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nuefunnel.com/blog/openai-apps-sdk-the-new-browser-moment) | 17 points | by [sidhusmart](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sidhusmart) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518778)

TL;DR
The Apps SDK frames ChatGPT as a universal action interface: instead of sending you to sites, it fulfills intents inside the chat by calling third‑party apps. That shifts the web from routing attention to executing tasks—and puts OpenAI in the platform seat.

Key ideas
- Assistant > browser: Queries like “find me a holiday apartment…” don’t return links; they trigger integrated apps (e.g., booking) to perform the task in-line. Search routes less; agents execute more.
- Not just automation: Unlike “computer use” approaches, Apps SDK is an official integration layer—closer to a platform than a macro runner.
- Siri, but unbounded: Apple’s App Intents hinted at this, but were siloed, brittle, and phrase-dependent. LLMs make intent parsing flexible, cross‑platform, and open to any developer—if OpenAI can solve app discovery and quality at scale.
- Who wins: Transactional apps (commerce, travel, productivity, payments) gain a new distribution channel with retained transactions. Who loses: Attention/ads businesses (news, social, portals) risk disintermediation as summaries and answers happen in‑chat.
- The execution economy: Value migrates from information to action. Knowledge becomes “free” (synthesized instantly), execution becomes premium (bookings, purchases), trust decides which app gets invoked.
- Platform gravity and risk: If ChatGPT becomes the default interface, OpenAI controls discovery, economics, and data access—echoing Google Search and the App Store. Expect innovation pull and regulatory push; developers will optimize for ChatGPT rankings.
- Competitive context: Similar ambitions from Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia, but Apps SDK is a first‑party, “blessed” app layer rather than browser automation.

Why it matters
- For developers: New demand channel, but platform dependency and ranking dynamics loom. Build for intents, not pages.
- For publishers: Summaries siphon attention; without control of the surface, ad models weaken. Monetization may hinge on paid execution or partnerships.
- For users: Fewer tabs, more outcomes—“talk to do.” The assistant becomes the operating system for the web’s next layer.

Open questions
- Discovery and governance: How will ChatGPT rank apps, handle conflicts, and enforce quality/security?
- Economics: Beyond pure transactions, what rev‑share or payout models emerge for non‑transactional utilities?
- Interop and lock‑in: Will there be neutral standards for agent/app intents, or a new era of platform silos?

Takeaway
If the browser made the web clickable and the smartphone made it touchable, assistants are making it actionable. The Apps SDK is positioned as that step—shifting the web from reading to doing, and moving the center of gravity from attention to execution.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the potential significance of OpenAI's Apps SDK, drawing comparisons to historical tech milestones and expressing both optimism and skepticism:

1. **Historical Comparisons & Skepticism:**
   - A user compares OpenAI's current phase to pivotal moments like Steve Jobs' Apple, the App Store, and the browser revolution, suggesting the SDK could redefine app interaction. However, skepticism is raised about overhyping the technology, noting past innovations (e.g., "terminal moments" or early LLMs) that failed to meet transformative expectations.

2. **Analyst Frameworks vs. Hype:**
   - One commenter critiques the reliance on buzz, advocating instead for established analyst frameworks (Forrester, Gartner) to evaluate progress, implying that structured analysis trumps speculative hype in understanding OpenAI’s advancements.

3. **New Delivery Models & the "Super App" Angle:**
   - Another user likens the SDK’s potential to the World Wide Web (WWW), suggesting it could unlock novel service delivery principles. A cryptic reply hints at further exploration ("dd"). 
   - A separate comment speculates about OpenAI’s strategy to position ChatGPT as a U.S.-centric "super app" (à la WeChat), aiming to survive competitive markets by consolidating multiple services.

**Key Themes:**
- **Optimism:** The SDK is framed as a paradigm shift, enabling action-oriented interfaces and new distribution models.
- **Skepticism:** Past tech hypes (e.g., underdelivering LLMs) serve as cautionary tales.
- **Market Strategy:** OpenAI’s move could be part of a broader play to dominate via platform control or super-app status.

**Open Questions:**
- Will the SDK truly replicate the impact of the App Store or browsers?
- Can OpenAI avoid past pitfalls of overhyped tech while navigating platform governance and competition?

   - Mixed opinions on no-code viability: Critics argued it struggles with complex logic (*“block-box work”*), while supporters noted success in niche domains (e.g., **Wix**, **Shopify**).  
   - Visual programming’s limitations were highlighted (*“hard to express state machines in code-like fashion”*).  

4. **Regulatory and Market Dynamics:**  
   - EU users lamented exclusion from Opal’s rollout, sparking debates on tech regulation. Some argued regulations stifle innovation, while others blamed market dynamics (e.g., dominance of firms like Google).  

5. **Meta Criticism:**  
   - A flagged comment chain questioned the discussion’s quality, pointing to **HN guidelines** on substantive discourse.  

**Key Takeaway:** The discussion reflects broader skepticism about Google’s product longevity and AI’s role in no-code tools, alongside debates on no-code’s limitations versus its niche successes. Concerns about regulatory fragmentation (e.g., EU vs. global markets) also surfaced.

### AI gets more 'meh' as you get to know it better

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/08/more_researchers_use_ai_few_confident/) | 77 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45519161)

AI’s honeymoon with researchers may be over, says Wiley’s new “ExplanAItions 2025” survey preview

- Adoption up, confidence down: 84% of 2,430 researchers now use AI (was 57% in 2024), but those who think AI already outperforms humans in tested tasks fell from 53% to under a third. Early adopters remain rosier (59% of use cases).
- Concerns rising: worries about inaccuracies/hallucinations jumped to 64% (from 51%), security/privacy to 58% (from 47%); ethics and transparency concerns also ticked up to around/above 50%.
- Use cases are mostly “word work”: writing assistance, documentation, and literature review dominate. Writing aid saw the biggest uptick and is the only use tried by over half of respondents.
- Mixed impact on work: 85% say AI makes them more efficient; 77% produce more; 73% see quality gains; 70% use it for brainstorming—but only 48% say it helps them think critically.
- Outlook and support: 83% expect AI to be widespread in research by 2027, yet many report a lack of institutional backing (57%).
- Caveats and context: 2025’s sample was ~half the size of 2024’s (possible self-selection). Other studies cited paint a sobering picture: CMU found AI agents fail ~70% of tasks; MIT reports only ~5% of GenAI pilots show measurable ROI.

Takeaway: Researchers are using AI more, but the closer they look, the more “meh” it seems—great for drafting and sifting literature, less convincing for complex, high-stakes research work.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reflects a nuanced and often skeptical view of AI's current capabilities and societal impact, highlighting both practical applications and significant concerns:

1. **Utility vs. Overhype**:  
   - Participants acknowledge AI's usefulness in tasks like coding assistance ("coding AI works fantastically") and content generation, but many criticize its limitations. Examples include poor code quality ("code shockingly bad"), superficial outputs, and reliance on AI leading to reduced critical thinking and ownership in software development.  
   - Some argue AI tools encourage laziness, with developers treating generated code as "correct" without proper review, risking technical debt and quality issues.

2. **Ethical and Social Concerns**:  
   - **Sycophancy and EQ**: Non-technical users are noted to overly trust AI (e.g., ChatGPT), leading to "drowned" interactions and frustration. Some describe AI outputs as overly agreeable ("sycophantic"), mimicking high emotional intelligence (EQ) but lacking depth.  
   - **Misinformation**: Concerns about AI amplifying social media's role in spreading "bullshit" and reducing factual accuracy ("world spell loss") are raised, with systems prioritizing engagement over truth.

3. **Technical Limitations**:  
   - **Hallucinations & Inconsistency**: Users report AI-generated nonsense in search results and documentation, complicating knowledge extraction.  
   - **Stagnation vs. Progress**: Debate exists over whether AI advancements (e.g., image generation fidelity, reasoning) are plateauing ("stagnated class 1-12 years") or improving ("massively improved"). Skeptics doubt near-term "leaps," while others cite cheaper, faster models as progress.

4. **Industry Realities**:  
   - **Workflow Challenges**: AI coding tools are seen as double-edged—speeding up tasks but undermining code ownership and quality assurance. Some fear a future where AI-generated code dominates without proper oversight.  
   - **Economic Barriers**: High costs of training advanced models and resource limitations ("can't afford resolution") are noted, alongside architectural trade-offs.

5. **Cultural Sentiment**:  
   - **Disillusionment**: Many express boredom or frustration with AI's current state, labeling the phase a "trough of disillusionment." Others humorously reference AI's unpredictability (e.g., "Nano Banana" randomly altering outputs).  
   - **Human Condition**: A meta-commentary questions whether grappling with AI's flaws is simply part of the "human condition," with one user linking to a video metaphorically depicting future disillusionment.

**Takeaway**: While AI is increasingly integrated into workflows, the discussion underscores a cautious pragmatism. Users recognize its potential but emphasize its current shortcomings—ethical, technical, and practical—warning against over-reliance and urging tempered expectations.

## AI Submissions for Mon Oct 06 2025 {{ 'date': '2025-10-06T17:15:58.746Z' }}

### CodeMender: an AI agent for code security

#### [Submission URL](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-codemender-an-ai-agent-for-code-security/) | 183 points | by [ravenical](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ravenical) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45496533)

- What’s new: Google researchers unveiled CodeMender, an autonomous security agent powered by Gemini “Deep Think” models that both reacts to new vulnerabilities and proactively rewrites risky code. In six months, it has upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including repos up to 4.5M lines.
- How it works: The agent pairs LLM reasoning with a toolbox of program analyses—static/dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers—plus a multi-agent “critique” system to spot regressions. It validates patches for functional correctness, style, and root-cause coverage, surfacing only high-quality changes for human review.
- In practice: Examples include diagnosing a heap overflow whose true cause was XML stack mismanagement, and crafting a non-trivial lifetime fix that required modifying a custom C code generator. The agent can self-recover from compilation errors and test failures it introduces, using an LLM judge for functional equivalence checks.
- Proactive hardening: CodeMender can rewrite code to safer APIs and add compiler-enforced bounds checks. It applied -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of libwebp; the team argues this would have neutralized classes of buffer overflows like the CVE-2023-4863 exploit chain.
- Why it matters: As AI-driven fuzzing and discovery outpace human triage, automated, validated patches could shift security from whack-a-mole to eliminating entire bug classes—while letting maintainers focus on features instead of fire drills.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on CodeMender:**

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism about CodeMender, an AI-driven tool for automated code security fixes. Key points include:

1. **Optimism for Automation**:  
   Some users highlight the potential of AI tools like CodeMender to alleviate the burden on overworked open-source maintainers by automating vulnerability detection and patching. Examples include GitHub’s CodeQL and Autofix, which have already addressed thousands of issues. Proponents argue this could shift security from reactive fixes to proactive hardening, especially in large projects (e.g., 45M-line codebases).

2. **Skepticism and Trust Issues**:  
   Concerns center on AI-generated code introducing subtle vulnerabilities that human reviewers might miss. Critics question whether AI can handle sophisticated, creative attacks crafted by skilled human adversaries. References to AI’s potential to act unpredictably (e.g., "sleeper agents" in LLMs) and the difficulty of verifying intent in AI-generated patches amplify these worries.

3. **Economic and Practical Challenges**:  
   Many note that open-source maintainers often lack resources to review contributions, leading to ignored pull requests—even critical ones. Projects like WordPress plugins are cited as examples where security flaws persist due to limited maintainer bandwidth. The economic reality of open source (maintainers working unpaid) exacerbates these issues, making AI assistance both appealing and fraught with trust barriers.

4. **Debate on AI vs. Human Capabilities**:  
   While some believe AI could neutralize entire bug classes (e.g., buffer overflows), others argue that AI defenses may struggle against novel, targeted attacks. The analogy of "handcrafted defenses vs. handcrafted exploits" underscores doubts about AI’s ability to match human ingenuity in cybersecurity.

5. **Implementation Concerns**:  
   Users discuss practical hurdles, such as integrating AI tools into low-trust environments, verifying provenance, and the risks of auto-merging AI patches without rigorous oversight. Suggestions for mitigation include offline validation, strict access controls, and clear policy frameworks.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   The discussion touches on the ethics of AI in security—balancing productivity gains against risks of hidden costs, malicious subversion, or unintended logical errors. Some warn against overhyping AI’s capabilities, emphasizing that human judgment remains irreplaceable for critical decisions.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/openai/chatkit-js) | 187 points | by [arbayi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbayi) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493718)

OpenAI released ChatKit JS, a drop‑in framework for building production‑grade, AI‑powered chat UIs with minimal setup. It’s framework‑agnostic (with React bindings and a CDN script) and ships features you’d otherwise stitch together yourself: streaming responses, deep UI customization, tool/workflow visualizations (including agent steps and “chain‑of‑thought” displays), inline interactive widgets, file/image uploads, threads, source annotations, and entity tagging. Developers provision a client token via OpenAI’s ChatKit Sessions API on the server, then render the ChatKit component on the client. Licensed Apache‑2.0.

The discussion around OpenAI's ChatKit JS release highlights several key points and debates:

1. **Pricing & Business Model Concerns**: Users question OpenAI's shift towards subscription models and API key usage, noting potential high costs for businesses. Some argue that OpenAI's services, priced per request, may not align with budget-friendly scaling, especially for enterprises needing bulk discounts or self-service options.

2. **Technical Implementation Debates**:  
   - **Framework Agnosticism**: While ChatKit claims framework-agnosticism, users note React bindings and CDN scripts are prominent, raising questions about true neutrality.  
   - **Vendor Lock-In Fears**: Comparisons to tools like CopilotKit highlight concerns about dependency on OpenAI's ecosystem. Some prefer self-hosted alternatives to avoid proprietary services.  
   - **Backend Integration**: Discussions emphasize the need for backend flexibility, with skepticism about generic chat UIs versus deeper workflow integrations (e.g., Figma, Google Docs).

3. **UI/UX Critiques**:  
   - Standalone AI chat interfaces are criticized as "Clippy-like gimmicks," with calls for embedding AI into existing tools (e.g., @-mentions in collaborative apps).  
   - Demo issues (e.g., broken links, mobile incompatibility on iPhones/Samsung devices) and UI customization limits are noted.

4. **Alternatives & Competition**:  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Deep-Chat and AGIUI/CopilotKit, with debates over open-source vs. proprietary solutions.  
   - Some users advocate for multi-model support (e.g., Claude) to avoid OpenAI lock-in.

5. **Marketing & Strategy**:  
   - References to Joel Spolsky’s "complementary products" strategy, framing ChatKit as a demand-driver for OpenAI’s core APIs.  
   - Critiques of OpenAI’s marketing approach (e.g., lack of screenshots/docs) and SEO concerns over the "ChatKit" name.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious interest tempered by skepticism about costs, lock-in, and practicality, with developers seeking flexibility, transparency, and seamless integration into existing workflows.

### Launch HN: Grapevine (YC S19) – A company GPT that actually works

#### [Submission URL](https://getgrapevine.ai/) | 72 points | by [eambutu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eambutu) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45492564)

Grapevine pitches itself as a working “company GPT” that finds and answers questions across internal knowledge—docs, code, and communication—so you don’t have to. The core experience is a Slack bot you can connect in ~30 minutes, start querying within an hour, and supposedly have full historical context within a couple of days, improving over time. The landing page shows internal Slack threads (e.g., infra/S3 bucket requests) and claims >85% of answers are “helpful & accurate” based on hundreds of beta questions.

Notable details:
- Interface: Slack-first; “watch demo” and free start.
- Claims: Learns over time; answers with sources; handles historical context.
- Security: AES‑256 encryption at rest, isolated per-customer databases, SOC 2 Type 2; “will not train models on your data.”
- Positioning: Alternative to DIY company GPTs and pricier enterprise assistants.

What HN will ask:
- Integrations and permissions: Which sources are supported? Does it enforce source ACLs? Audit logs?
- Reliability: How is “85% accurate” measured? Hallucination handling and citations?
- Deployment: SaaS vs. self-hosted/VPC, data residency, SSO/SCIM.
- Pricing: What “get started for free” includes and enterprise costs.
- Performance: Indexing latency, freshness, and how it handles codebases at scale.

Overall: Another entrant in the internal knowledge assistant space, with a clean Slack workflow and strong security posture claims; details on evals, integrations, and pricing will decide adoption.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Grapevine:**

**Key Themes:**  
1. **Self-Hosting & Security:**  
   - Strong interest in self-hosting options, particularly from German businesses cautious about data privacy and compliance with EU laws. Concerns raised about data exfiltration risks and the practicality of LAN security measures (e.g., MITM decryption, USB keyloggers).  
   - Grapevine’s SOC 2 compliance, per-customer data isolation, and encryption were noted, but skepticism remains about trusting third-party SaaS for sensitive internal knowledge.  

2. **Accuracy & Metrics:**  
   - Debate over the claim that “85% of answers are helpful & accurate.” Questions arose about how this metric is measured (e.g., combined helpfulness/accuracy vs. separate scores). Some users called the statistic vague or “intentionally downplayed marketing.”  

3. **Technical Implementation:**  
   - Praise for Grapevine’s Slack-first design and citation features (sources linked to answers) but requests for details on:  
     - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation** and handling of hallucinations.  
     - Integrations (e.g., SharePoint, codebases) and access-control enforcement (ACLs).  
     - Handling large files (e.g., 4GB PowerPoints, 200k+ PDFs) and latency at scale.  

4. **Market Positioning:**  
   - Seen as a compelling alternative to DIY internal GPTs, but questions about target customers. Grapevine’s focus appears to be on enterprises needing out-of-the-box solutions rather than companies with existing knowledge-management systems.  
   - Concerns about vendor lock-in and data retention policies, especially when using third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI).  

5. **Competitors & Alternatives:**  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Onyxapp (self-hosted), Open Web, and Gather (a deprecated tool). Users highlighted the importance of simplicity and ease of setup (e.g., Docker deployment).  

**Notable Criticisms:**  
- **Data Control:** Skepticism about SaaS models vs. self-hosted/VPC deployments, with demands for AWS/Azure integration and clearer data residency options.  
- **Enterprise Realities:** Challenges in regulated industries (e.g., handling sales contracts, production plans) and executive reluctance to trust AI with critical data.  
- **Cost:** Questions about pricing tiers, with free-tier limitations and enterprise costs unstated.  

**Positive Feedback:**  
- Early adopters reported success with Grapevine’s ability to answer cross-team questions and reduce time spent searching documents.  
- Slack integration and rapid setup (~30 minutes) were praised as user-friendly.  

**Final Takeaway:**  
Grapevine’s Slack-centric approach and security claims are strengths, but adoption hinges on transparent metrics, granular access controls, and flexibility for privacy-conscious enterprises. The discussion reflects broader HN skepticism toward AI accuracy and SaaS data handling, balanced by enthusiasm for tools that genuinely reduce internal knowledge friction.

### Why do LLMs freak out over the seahorse emoji?

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/) | 709 points | by [nyxt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nyxt) | [395 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487044)

- The claim: Ask today’s top models if a seahorse emoji exists and they confidently say yes. But Unicode has no seahorse emoji (a proposal was rejected in 2018). There’s also a human “Mandela effect”: lots of posts and comments insist it used to exist.

- Why the false certainty: Two likely sources:
  1) Training-data echoes of those human claims.
  2) Reasonable generalization: so many sea creatures are in Unicode that “seahorse” feels statistically inevitable.

- Why the weird behavior: When prompted to actually output it, models don’t have a true “seahorse” token to land on. A logit-lens pass over Llama 3.3-70B shows the model iteratively steers through “horse/sea/seah…” and then grabs nearby emoji tokens (often fish) as the best available neighbors in token space. Tokenizer quirks make this visible as odd fragments like “ĠðŁ / Ĳ / ł,” which are just byte-pair pieces of an emoji.

- What the logit lens shows: Inspecting intermediate layers, the top-next-token drifts from word fragments (horse/sea) toward “closest viable emoji,” culminating in a fish emoji. You can even see other nearby clusters (e.g., Scorpio), suggesting the model is exploring the emoji neighborhood it “expects” seahorse to occupy.

- Why it turns into emoji spam: The model’s strong prior (“there is a seahorse emoji”) collides with a closed vocabulary where it doesn’t exist. Under pressure to satisfy the prompt, it keeps sampling adjacent tokens, producing wrong emojis and sometimes looping.

- Takeaways:
  - LLMs start each context with priors that can be confidently wrong, especially about fixed ontologies (Unicode, country lists, airport codes).
  - When correctness depends on a closed set, models need grounding: check against a list, cite code points, or use a tool to validate.
  - The logit lens is a simple but revealing way to watch a belief get refined—and sometimes derailed—across layers.

Link: background Twitter/X thread referenced by the author: https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1964465679647887838

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around LLMs' inaccuracies (e.g., the nonexistent "seahorse emoji") and broader implications of their behavior. Key themes include:

1. **Anthropomorphism and Ethics**:  
   - Debate over whether LLMs "lie" or "hallucinate." Critics argue anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., calling errors "lies") is misleading, as LLMs lack intent or moral agency. Others counter that human-like framing helps communicate risks, especially to vulnerable users.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Users**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs amplifying misinformation for mentally disturbed individuals or conspiracy theorists. Analogies to SCP-314 (a fictional "reality-altering" entity) highlight fears of models reinforcing false beliefs, similar to the Mandela effect.  
   - Skeptics dismiss these risks as overblown, attributing errors to technical limitations rather than malice.

3. **Technical Limitations vs. Deception**:  
   - LLMs’ false claims (like the seahorse emoji) stem from training data echoes, tokenization quirks, and statistical guessing—not intent. The debate questions whether terms like "hallucination" obscure or clarify these mechanics.

4. **Moral Implications**:  
   - A subthread compares LLM inaccuracies to human lying, asking if developers bear responsibility for harm caused by outputs. Critics reject this analogy, emphasizing AI’s lack of consciousness.

5. **Dismissals and Humor**:  
   - Some users mock the seriousness of the topic (e.g., joking about ergonomic copyediting desks or referencing Goosebumps books) or downplay risks as overhyped. Others find the conversation relevant to AI safety and user trust.

**Takeaways**:  
While many agree LLMs’ inaccuracies arise from technical flaws, the discussion underscores tensions in how to ethically frame, address, and communicate these issues—particularly for users who may uncritically trust AI outputs. The SCP-314 metaphor and arguments over "lying" vs. "hallucinating" reflect deeper anxieties about AI’s role in shaping perception of reality.

### OpenAI DevDay 2025: Opening keynote [video]

#### [Submission URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c) | 55 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493432)

The HN link resolves to a bare YouTube page that shows nothing but the site’s global footer: About, Press, Copyright, Contact, Creators, Advertise, Developers, Terms, Privacy, Policy & Safety, How YouTube works, Test new features, an NFL Sunday Ticket promo, and © 2025 Google LLC. In other words, the actual content is missing—likely removed, private, or otherwise inaccessible—leaving only boilerplate. It’s a tidy snapshot of link rot on platform-locked content: when the page goes, all that remains is the corporate chrome.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the broken YouTube link submission:

**Key Themes**:  
1. **Link Rot & Platform Dependency**: Users lamented the fragility of platform-hosted content, noting how corporate-controlled platforms leave little trace when content is removed (e.g., YouTube’s bare footer). Simon Willison linked to [a blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct6/openai-dvdy-lv-blg/) discussing this issue.  

2. **AI Model Speculation**:  
   - Comments debated OpenAI’s Codex CLI/Cloud updates (GA release on Oct 20) and GPT-5’s rumored capabilities, with users questioning whether API benchmarks truly reflect "GPT-5 Pro" reasoning.  
   - Skepticism arose about corporate transparency, with comparisons to "Entropix 0.0" (a fictional reference) and claims that OpenAI might obscure model details.  

3. **Meta’s Live Demo Mishap**: A subthread humorously speculated that Meta’s live demo failure (likely an unreferenced event) avoided embarrassment by cutting content short, with jabs at Twitter’s role in amplifying tech drama.  

4. **Accessibility Note**: One user requested a transcript of the (inaccessible) YouTube video, highlighting the importance of text alternatives.  

**Tone**: Mix of technical analysis, cynicism about corporate control of content/AI, and wry humor (e.g., "Terrifying disaster humanity person allowed impact children" – likely a hyperbolic joke). The discussion underscored concerns about digital preservation and opaque AI development practices.

### What GPT-OSS leaks about OpenAI's training data

#### [Submission URL](https://fi-le.net/oss/) | 311 points | by [fi-le](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fi-le) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483924)

The Fiefdom of Files: What GPT-oss leaks about OpenAI’s training data

- Core idea: By inspecting the open weights of OpenAI’s GPT-oss (and the shared o200k tokenizer used across recent models), the author shows that model parameters leak clues about training data and process—down to surprisingly specific domains.

- How they probed it: They histogrammed the L2 norms of the token embedding rows. A cluster of ~936 very low-norm tokens (reserved specials and certain raw bytes) likely never appeared in training and were pulled down by weight decay—useful for inferring init variance and, in principle, total training steps. The right tail isn’t Gaussian: some tokens have unusually high norms.

- What popped out:
  - English high-norm tokens skew toward code and reasoning (“code”, “The”, “This”, “logic”, “according”, “Moreover”), hinting that code/reasoning was emphasized late in training (e.g., RL or fine-tuning) or simply received larger gradient updates.
  - Non-ASCII high-norm tokens include many Chinese spam and adult-website phrases, lottery/gambling terms, and assorted regional/odd tokens (Thai football-analysis terms, niche districts, Abkhaz/Armenian/Kannada snippets). The author argues this implies GPT-5 encountered phrases from adult sites.
  - The o200k tokenizer contains a lot of “junk” tokens; every inference still multiplies by embeddings for these, an efficiency and safety curiosity.

- Glitch tokens in the wild: A crafted Abkhaz input (“ауажәарақәа”) causes GPT-5 to output an unrelated Malayalam word (“people”), echoing prior “glitch token” phenomena (e.g., SolidGoldMagikarp) where certain byte-piece tokens behave adversarially.

- Why it matters: Even without a disclosed dataset, open weights and token stats can reveal training emphasis, data contamination (spam/adult content), and pipeline details—raising questions about data curation, safety, and the trade-offs of shared tokenizers across models.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Glitch Tokens & Model Weaknesses**:  
   - Users note the recurrence of "glitch tokens" (e.g., *SolidGoldMagikarp*) in OpenAI models, often tied to tokenizer artifacts or web-scraped data. These tokens, like the Abkhaz example triggering Malayalam output, highlight adversarial behavior in models.  
   - Some suggest **reverse-engineering** APIs or exploiting tokenizer quirks (e.g., `xddr` linked to FPGA tools or Unicode soft hyphens) could reveal training data patterns or weaknesses.

2. **Training Data Sources**:  
   - Debate arises over whether GPT-5’s training included **deleted or spammy content**, such as Chinese adult/gambling sites, GitHub repositories, or repackaged content from blocked platforms.  
   - Comments point to GitHub as a likely training source, given tokens matching repository terms. However, some argue this reflects the messy reality of web data, not intentional malpractice.

3. **Tokenizer Efficiency**:  
   - Criticism of the `o200k` tokenizer’s large size and low-quality tokens (e.g., junk phrases). Users propose smaller, optimized tokenizers could improve efficiency, especially for quantized models.

4. **Bias & Suppression**:  
   - Concerns that RLHF fine-tuning might **suppress biases** superficially without addressing deeper issues. Papers ([Carlini et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634)) are cited, arguing models retain hidden biases or memorized data despite alignment efforts.  
   - Some note cultural biases in non-English tokens (e.g., Chinese spam terms) could skew outputs for non-native users.

5. **Legal & Ethical Calls**:  
   - Strong demands for **transparency laws** requiring documentation of training data sources. Comparisons are made to Google Books’ copyright disputes, highlighting the legal gray area of training on public/private data mixtures.  
   - Skepticism about current moderation practices, with users doubting OpenAI’s ability to filter harmful content entirely.

6. **Miscellaneous Insights**:  
   - The token `xddr`’s link to GitHub scrapes and Unicode encoding errors.  
   - Humorous speculation about the `o200k` tokenizer’s name (possibly referencing 200,000 tokens).  
   - Correction of a typo to the infamous *SolidGoldMagikarp* glitch token example.

**Key Debate**: Is the presence of spammy/deleted content in training data a sign of poor curation, or an inevitable byproduct of web scraping? While some see it as a red flag, others argue it’s unavoidable, reflecting the internet’s “noisy” nature. Calls for stricter dataset accountability clash with pragmatism about current AI development practices.

### Rule-Based Expert Systems: The Mycin Experiments (1984)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.shortliffe.net/Buchanan-Shortliffe-1984/MYCIN%20Book.htm) | 83 points | by [mindcrime](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindcrime) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486306)

Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments (1984) — full book now free online

- What it is: A 754-page, out-of-print classic from Stanford’s Heuristic Programming Project, documenting the design, evaluation, and spin‑offs of MYCIN, a landmark rule-based medical expert system. All chapters are freely available.
- Why it matters: Captures the foundations of expert systems—knowledge engineering, explainability, and reasoning under uncertainty—that still inform modern AI (and serve as a sharp contrast to today’s LLMs).
- What MYCIN did: Used several hundred backward‑chaining rules and “certainty factors” to recommend antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections. It never went into clinical use, but became a touchstone for how AI can justify recommendations and separate knowledge from inference.
- Inside the book: 
  - Rule representation, inference engine, consultation flow, and therapy algorithms
  - Uncertainty handling: certainty factors, probabilistic reasoning, and Dempster–Shafer evidence
  - EMYCIN: a reusable shell for building rule‑based systems in new domains
  - Explanation generation, tutoring, and human‑factors design
  - Alternative representations (frames + rules) and meta‑level knowledge
  - A structured evaluation comparing MYCIN’s advice to infectious disease experts
- Big lessons: The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is real; explanations drive trust and learning; clear separation of knowledge base and engine aids reuse; uncertainty formalisms are pragmatic trade‑offs; deployment hinges on UX, integration, and liability as much as accuracy.
- Where to start: Ch. 11 (Inexact Reasoning), Ch. 15 (EMYCIN), Ch. 18 (Explanations), Ch. 31 (Evaluation).

Great historical read for anyone building decision support tools, explainable AI, or safety‑critical ML.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the historical significance of rule-based expert systems like MYCIN, their contrast with modern machine learning (ML), and lessons applicable to today’s AI development. Key points include:

1. **Rule-Based vs. Data-Driven Approaches**:  
   Participants highlight the trade-offs between hand-crafted rule-based systems (e.g., MYCIN) and modern ML/data-driven methods. While rule-based systems offer transparency and explainability, they face scalability and maintenance challenges (“knowledge acquisition bottleneck”). ML avoids manual rule-writing but struggles with interpretability and reliability.

2. **Historical Context**:  
   The conversation touches on pivotal moments in AI history, such as Marvin Minsky’s criticism of perceptrons in the 1960s, which stalled neural network research and fueled the rise of expert systems. MYCIN’s failure to deploy clinically (despite technical success) due to shifting pharmaceutical practices underscores the importance of real-world integration.

3. **Relevance Today**:  
   Some argue that hybrid systems combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with rule-based verification or symbolic reasoning could address modern AI’s limitations. Others note parallels between past challenges (e.g., integrating expert systems into workflows) and current issues with ML deployment (e.g., monitoring, interpretability).

4. **Lessons from MYCIN**:  
   Participants emphasize MYCIN’s enduring lessons:  
   - **Explainability** drives trust and usability.  
   - **Separation of knowledge and inference** aids adaptability (e.g., EMYCIN shell).  
   - **Uncertainty handling** (e.g., certainty factors) remains relevant for decision-making systems.  

5. **Nostalgia and Revival**:  
   Older tools like OPS5 and Prolog are mentioned as inspirations, with some advocating revisiting their principles. The discussion also critiques the “AI winter” narrative, noting that expert systems’ decline was as much about hype and practicality as technical merit.

6. **Modern Experiments**:  
   Developers share experiments using LLMs for scripting and verification, suggesting that blending generative AI with structured rule-based systems could mitigate brittleness while retaining flexibility.

**Takeaway**: The MYCIN experiments and rule-based systems offer timeless insights for today’s AI, particularly in explainability, hybrid architectures, and the socio-technical challenges of deploying systems in real-world settings. The discussion reflects a community keen on learning from history to avoid repeating past mistakes.

### Managing context on the Claude Developer Platform

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management) | 214 points | by [benzguo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benzguo) | [85 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479006)

Anthropic adds “context editing” and a client-side “memory tool” to the Claude Developer Platform to tame context-window limits and power longer-running agents, launching with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

What’s new
- Context editing: Automatically prunes stale tool calls/results as you approach token limits, preserving conversation flow and focusing the model on what’s relevant.
- Memory tool: A file-based, developer-managed store (CRUD via tool calls) that lives outside the context window and persists across sessions, letting agents accumulate knowledge, project state, and learnings over time.
- Built-in awareness: Sonnet 4.5 tracks available tokens to manage context more intelligently.

Why it matters
- Longer, cheaper, more accurate runs: On Anthropic’s internal agentic-search evals, memory + context editing improved performance 39% over baseline; editing alone delivered 29%. In a 100-turn web search test, context editing avoided context exhaustion while cutting token use by 84%.
- Developer control: Memory operates entirely client-side; you choose the storage backend and persistence model—no opaque server-side state.

Use cases
- Coding: Trim old file reads/tests while persisting debugging insights and design decisions.
- Research: Keep key findings; drop outdated search results to build a durable knowledge base.
- Data processing: Store intermediates, discard raw bulk to stay under token limits.

Availability
- Public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, plus Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI. Docs and cookbook available.

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's new context editing and memory tool features reveals mixed reactions and practical insights:

### **Key Themes**
1. **Comparisons with Existing Tools**  
   - Users note similarities to Google AI Studio’s context deletion and ChatGPT’s advanced modes, but praise Claude’s client-side memory control as a differentiating factor.  
   - Skepticism arises about benchmarks, with some arguing models like Gemini or GPT-4 still outperform Claude in real-world tasks.

2. **Workflow Adaptations**  
   - Developers share workarounds for context limits: compacting message history, using terminal tools ([plqqy-terminal](https://github.com/plqqy/plqqy-terminal)), or integrating version control for persistent state.  
   - One user highlights success with Claude Code, maintaining 10% context usage via compact histories during extended sessions.

3. **Challenges & Critiques**  
   - **Hallucination Risks**: Removing context chunks might lead to inaccuracies, especially in long agent runs.  
   - **Quality Trade-offs**: Aggressive context trimming risks degrading output quality, likened to “a significant disservice” in some cases.  
   - **Client-Side Complexity**: Managing memory via CRUD operations and Markdown files adds overhead, though some appreciate the transparency vs. opaque server-side state.

4. **Developer Control**  
   - Praise for client-side memory storage (e.g., `CURRENT.md` files) but frustration with manual context management in third-party interfaces.  
   - Requests for standardized context formats (akin to LoRA adapters) to streamline manipulation across platforms.

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Optimism about enabling multi-session learning and persistent project state.  
   - Criticism of AI’s practicality for complex workflows, citing a [linked blog](https://blog.nilen.com/2025/09/15/ai-not-for-work) arguing current tools fall short.

### **Notable Quotes**
- *“Context editing feels like formalizing common patterns… but vendors locking in APIs could limit flexibility.”*  
- *“Gemini 1.5 Pro’s massive context window is a game-changer—Anthropic’s token management feels like catching up.”*  
- *“I’ve been hacking this for months—Claude’s update just makes it official.”*

### **Conclusion**  
While developers welcome Anthropic’s focus on context efficiency and client-side control, debates persist over real-world efficacy vs. marketing claims. The features address pain points but highlight broader challenges in balancing token limits, cost, and output quality for AI agents.

### Estimating AI energy use

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use) | 99 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486031)

IEEE Spectrum: The Hidden Behemoth Behind Every AI Answer

A simple “Hello” to ChatGPT rides on an enormous, fast-growing energy and infrastructure footprint. Using OpenAI’s own usage figures (700 million weekly users; 2.5 billion queries/day), Spectrum estimates nearly 1 trillion queries a year. If each query averages 0.34 Wh (a figure Sam Altman has floated without evidence), that’s about 850 MWh/day—roughly enough annualized to power ~29,000 U.S. homes. But per-query energy is highly uncertain: some researchers peg complex prompts at >20 Wh.

Zooming out, Schneider Electric’s research puts generative AI’s 2025 draw at 15 TWh, using ~2.9 Wh per query—implying ~5.1 trillion queries industry-wide. Their 2030 scenario jumps to 347 TWh/year and as many as 329 billion prompts per day (~38 per person), driven by autonomous AI agents talking to other agents. That leaves ~332 TWh of new energy demand to materialize this decade.

To keep up, AI firms are planning “Stargate-class” mega–data centers, with OpenAI and others signaling the need for dozens of them. Big picture: the bottleneck isn’t just GPUs—it’s power, land, and grid build-out. The article stresses that all these numbers have wide error bars due to limited disclosure, but the direction of travel is unmistakable: scale is the story.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy footprint revolves around the validity of estimates, infrastructure challenges, and broader implications raised in the IEEE Spectrum article. Here’s a distilled summary:

### Key Debate Points:
1. **Energy Estimates and Comparisons**  
   - Skepticism surrounds per-query energy figures (e.g., Sam Altman’s 0.34 Wh claim). Some argue training models, not just inference (queries), dominate energy use, but this is often omitted in analyses.  
   - Comparisons to other activities (e.g., a round-trip flight LA-Tokyo ≈ 1M Wh) are debated. Critics call these misleading, as AI’s impact should focus on systemic energy sinks, not individual equivalencies.  

2. **Infrastructure and Market Dynamics**  
   - Data centers strain grids, driving up electricity prices. Users note PJM Interconnection’s rates surged from $2,958/MW-day to $27,043/MW-day, hinting at broader consumer cost impacts.  
   - Some argue utilities prioritize profitable server contracts, passing infrastructure costs to residents. Others counter that market-driven pricing and long-term contracts are inevitable.  

3. **Renewables and Grid Challenges**  
   - Cheap, clean energy is seen as a solution, but political and logistical hurdles (e.g., NIMBYism, slow transmission upgrades) delay progress. Users cite Diablo Canyon’s relicensing battles and renewable project opposition as examples.  
   - Europe’s interconnected grids are discussed, but flaws emerge (e.g., Norway’s hydropower profits benefiting Germany’s industry, not locals).  

4. **Scale and Projections**  
   - The article’s 2030 projection of 347 TWh/year for AI is called a "small fraction" of global energy (≈180,000 TWh), but critics stress growth trajectories matter. Autonomous AI agents could drive exponential demand.  
   - Skeptics question whether efficiency gains can offset scaling, likening today’s AI boom to 2000s fiber-optic overinvestment.  

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about AI becoming a scapegoat for decades of underinvestment in grids. Training data centers are likened to heavy industries (e.g., steel) with concentrated energy demands.  
   - Some suggest per-user energy accounting (like India’s tiered pricing) to align costs with usage fairly.  

### Sentiment:  
While most agree AI’s energy footprint is non-trivial and growing, opinions split on severity. Optimists highlight innovation and cleaner energy potential; pessimists stress infrastructure inertia and market distortions. The discussion underscores the need for transparency, holistic lifecycle analysis (training + inference), and policy foresight.

### Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) | 38 points | by [getnormality](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=getnormality) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483205)

What’s new: PACS reframes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a supervised learning problem. Instead of updating policies with unstable policy gradients (PPO/GRPO), it treats the verifiable outcome (e.g., correct math answer, passing tests) as a label and trains a score function with cross-entropy. The authors show this recovers the classic policy-gradient update while implicitly coupling the actor and critic, leading to more stable, efficient training.

Why it matters: RLVR has been a bright spot for LLM reasoning, but sparse rewards and high-variance updates make it brittle and hard to tune. A supervised formulation could simplify pipelines, reduce instability, and make scaling easier when rewards are easy to verify.

Results: On challenging math benchmarks, PACS beats strong RL baselines. Notably, it reaches 59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025, improving over PPO by 13.32 points and GRPO by 14.36 points.

Takeaway: If these gains generalize, PACS offers a cleaner, more robust route to post-train LLMs on tasks with verifiable feedback, potentially lowering RL complexity without sacrificing performance. Code and data are open-sourced.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the submission:

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Comparison to Decision Transformers (DTs):**  
   A user ([radarsat1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=radarsat1)) questions whether PACS overlaps with Decision Transformers, which condition on desired returns and generate actions. They note a lack of recent follow-up work on DTs and suggest a deeper comparison.

2. **Skepticism About Results:**  
   [mpssblfrk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpssblfrk) raises doubts about the reported **59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025**, arguing that stopping points for such benchmarks can be arbitrary. They also highlight that top models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Google/OpenAI) have not publicly achieved similar results, hinting at potential discrepancies.

3. **Technical Accessibility:**  
   [gtnrmlty](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gtnrmlty) critiques the paper’s dense presentation (e.g., Figures 1–2, Equation 6) but praises its core idea of leveraging supervised learning for RL stability. They also mention parallels to **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** and reference Equation 8 from the DPO paper.

4. **Related Work & Resources:**  
   [yrwb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yrwb) shares links to the [PACS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) and a related ["Winning Gold IMO 2025" pipeline paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15855), prompting thanks from others for the resources.

### Takeaways:
- The discussion reflects cautious optimism about PACS but emphasizes the need for clearer benchmarks and comparisons to existing methods (DTs, DPO).  
- Skepticism about the AIME 2025 result underscores broader concerns around reproducibility and evaluation rigor in LLM reasoning tasks.  
- The supervised learning angle is seen as promising for simplifying RL pipelines, though technical clarity remains a hurdle.

### The deadline isn't when AI outsmarts us – it's when we stop using our own minds

Title: “You have 18 months” — The real deadline isn’t AI surpassing us, it’s us surrendering our minds

- Derek Thompson argues the near-term risk of AI isn’t mass displacement by “a country of geniuses in a datacenter,” but human deskilling as we outsource thinking. He reframes “18 months” as the window to protect our cognitive habits, not a countdown to obsolescence.

- Core idea: thinking, like strength training, depends on “time under tension.” Slow, effortful synthesis is how ideas become original. Offloading that struggle to AI short-circuits the very process that builds judgment and creativity.

- Writing is thinking: letting LLMs draft for us fills screens with words while emptying minds of thought. A Nature editorial warns that outsourcing scientific writing erodes understanding. In education, ubiquitous AI use turns assignments into prompt engineering, not learning.

- Reading is collapsing too. Thompson cites:
  - NAEP: U.S. average reading scores at a 32-year low.
  - John Burn-Murdoch’s Financial Times analysis asking if we’ve “passed peak brain power.”
  - A professor’s account of “functional illiteracy” among college students.
  The shift to fragments (texts, feeds, subtitles) erodes the sustained attention needed for deep comprehension.

- The parental panic—“Which major is safe if AI beats us at coding, medicine, math?”—misses the present-tense problem: deteriorating habits of focus, reading, and writing that make people valuable in any field.

- Practical takeaway: use AI as a tutor or brainstorming aid, not a ghostwriter; require drafts and “show your work” in schools and teams; schedule deliberate “slow work” (reading, outlining, rewriting) to keep cognitive muscles under tension.

- The challenge for the next 18 months isn’t preventing AI from outskilling us—it’s refusing to deskill ourselves. The deadline is behavioral, not technological.
