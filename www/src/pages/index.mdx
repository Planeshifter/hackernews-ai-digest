### Training and aligning LLMs with RLHF and RLHF alternatives

#### [Submission URL](https://magazine.sebastianraschka.com/p/llm-training-rlhf-and-its-alternatives) | 95 points | by [rasbt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rasbt) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37455859)

Today's article on Sebastian Raschka's blog explores the process of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) in the context of training Language Models (LLMs). RLHF is an important component of modern LLM training as it allows for the incorporation of human preferences into the optimization process, leading to improved model performance and safety.

The article provides a step-by-step breakdown of RLHF, starting with a discussion of the canonical LLM training pipeline. This pipeline consists of three main steps: pretraining, supervised finetuning, and alignment. In the pretraining phase, models learn from vast unlabeled text datasets using a next-word prediction task. This allows for the leveraging of large, unlabeled datasets without the need for manual labeling.

The next step is supervised finetuning, where models are trained on instruction-output pairs. This involves predicting the next tokens in the output given specific instructions. Supervised finetuning requires smaller datasets compared to pretraining, as it involves human or high-quality LLM-generated instructions and desired outputs.

Finally, the article delves into the RLHF-based alignment step, which aims to align the LLM with human preferences. RLHF involves fine-tuning the model using reinforcement learning, where human feedback is used to guide and improve the model's responses. The article also provides a comparison between ChatGPT's and Llama 2's implementations of RLHF.

For those interested in alternatives to RLHF, the article includes a section that highlights the most recent alternatives and intends to keep it regularly updated.

Overall, the article offers a comprehensive overview of RLHF and its role in LLM training, providing insights into its importance and practical implementations.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of RLHF and its implications for language models. Here are some key points raised by the commenters:

- Discussions on the alignment process of LLMs highlight the challenges related to the quality and quantity of training data. The commenter "og_kalu" points out that producing good supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets can be quite challenging, while "phllpcrtr" emphasizes the high degree of reliability and reproducibility needed in LLMs, which may not be achieved easily.
- "wstrnr" suggests the addition of additional layers in LLMs to determine the relevance and logical soundness of presented conclusions, supporting the conclusions presented in the article.
- The issue of hallucination in language models is addressed by multiple commenters. "bgglbtl" states that the high degree of reliability and reproducibility in LLMs is crucial, and "Salgat" discusses the limitations of simple linear regression models in dealing with hallucinations and the need for more complex algorithms.
- "ftxbr" argues that large language models lack creativity and are limited in their cognitive capabilities, while "Salgat" counters that hallucination is a part of creativity and that wrong predictions are an inherent flaw of creative language models.
- "ShamelessC" criticizes the article for subtly misrepresenting OpenAI's intention regarding RLHF's role in hallucination reduction, stating that it was partially flawed in its design and purpose. The commenter also mentions Yann LeCun's opinion on training lesser models and retraining researchers.

Overall, the discussion explores the challenges and implications of RLHF in language models, including issues related to training data quality, hallucination, reliability, reproducibility, and creativity.

### What You Say to Google Assistant and Alexa (Not Siri) Gets Used for Ad Targeting

#### [Submission URL](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/digital-assistants/voice-assistants-and-ad-targeting-a1098726954/) | 64 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460403)

Have you ever wondered if your interactions with voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa are being used for ad targeting? Well, a new study by Northeastern University in Boston has found evidence that Google and Amazon do indeed use your voice interactions to draw conclusions about you. Based on what you say to these devices, Google can infer details like your marital status and homeowner status, while Amazon takes note of products you may be interested in. These companies use this data to supplement the information they already gather from your phones and laptops, and in turn, marketers use this valuable information to target ads to the people they believe are most likely to buy their products. So the requests you make to Alexa or Google Assistant can actually influence the ads you see online. The study also revealed that Google Assistant's responses to you can be influenced by your past interactions. On the other hand, Apple's Siri does not appear to connect any tags directly to users or use voice interactions to build a marketing profile. This study highlights the need for better transparency in the data privacy practices of voice assistants. While you may be used to being tracked online, it's important to consider how your interactions with voice assistants may also be contributing to targeted advertising.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the implications of the study's findings and the differences between voice assistants. Some users are surprised by the extent to which Google and Amazon use voice interactions for targeted advertising, while others expect this level of personalization. Commenters point out that Google profits from targeted ads based on user searches, while Amazon builds marketing profiles from Alexa purchases. There is also a mention of Apple's Siri, which does not seem to use voice interactions for ad targeting, leading to a discussion on Siri's privacy practices. One commenter shares an anecdote about their family's experience with targeted ads on their iPhones, raising questions about IP-based targeting and privacy. Another commenter mentions that Siri uses location services. One user dismisses the idea of any conspiracy theories surrounding the study findings and emphasizes the predictability and relevance of targeted ads. However, it is noted that people may not fully understand the extent to which their interactions are being used. A final comment raises the question of whether Siri has a private API or if Apple has access to Siri's data.

In a thought-provoking paper, Madeleine Clare Elish explores the concept of "moral crumple zones" in human-robot interaction. Drawing on examples of high-profile accidents involving complex automated systems, the author argues that the responsibility for an action may be unfairly attributed to a human operator who has limited control over the behavior of an autonomous or automated system. 

Much like a crumple zone in a car absorbs the force of impact in a crash, the author describes the human operator in a complex and automated system as a "component" that bears the brunt of moral and legal responsibilities when the system malfunctions. This concept challenges the design and regulation of human-robot systems, highlighting the potential for consumer and worker harm in new complex technologies.

By examining cases such as accidents involving driverless cars and other autonomous technologies, the paper raises important questions about responsibility, ethics, and the social perceptions of technology. Understanding and addressing these moral crumple zones is crucial as the use of artificial intelligence and automation continues to expand in society.

Overall, Elish’s paper provides a valuable perspective on the complex relationship between humans and technology, emphasizing the need for responsible design and regulation in the development of autonomous systems.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the concept of assigning responsibility in cases of accidents involving autonomous or automated systems. One user points out that legal systems have already adapted to handle situations where crimes are committed by proxy through human agents, but questions whether it makes sense to attribute responsibility to AI systems. Another user raises concerns about the consequences of neglecting human responsibility and shifting liability to non-human entities. They argue that failure to hold companies accountable for the actions of AI systems could lead to negative outcomes. 

The discussion also touches upon the role of truck drivers and whether they can be blamed for accidents caused by AI systems. Some argue that truck drivers are being unfairly blamed for accidents caused by system malfunctions. Others point out that human drivers may react differently in dangerous situations and that AI malfunctions may not be fully preventable.

There is also a discussion about the power dynamics and politics involved in assigning responsibility for accidents caused by AI systems. One user suggests that the legal system allows courts to determine appropriate punishments based on circumstances, while another argues that the legal system is flawed and that personal background and limited experience are factors in decision-making. 

The conversation delves into the broader issues of employer demands and the consequences of violating laws. Some argue that employees are forced to comply with unsafe conditions and that companies should be held responsible. Others mention the power imbalance between employers and employees and the importance of protections for employees. 

There is also a brief discussion on the role of courts and the ability of defendants to control their actions, as well as a comment about the inability to assign blame to non-human entities.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities of assigning responsibility and the need to address ethical and legal considerations in human-robot interaction.

### Improving NeRF quality by progressive camera placement

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00014) | 33 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460465)

A recent paper titled "Improving NeRF Quality by Progressive Camera Placement for Unrestricted Navigation in Complex Environments" explores how to enhance the quality of novel view synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in complex environments. NeRFs excel at object-centric reconstructions, but their performance in environments such as rooms and houses is often underwhelming. The researchers argue that high-quality data is crucial for optimizing a NeRF effectively, and propose an algorithm that suggests new camera placements to improve the visual quality of the reconstruction. Their solution outperforms existing methods and can be used with any NeRF model. This research has the potential to advance the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

In the comments, user "brdknwls" suggests that capturing 3D video instead of stills and using optimal camera placement can capture more information. User "fudged71" wonders if Gaussian Splattering techniques and AR headsets could also be effective. "Legend2440" mentions that NeRFs work with Gaussian splatting and improving 3D representation. "PaulHoule" finds the research exciting and suggests that the field could benefit from incorporating light field cameras for creating 3D models. "blvscff" mentions a separate research paper on Gaussian splattering. "lucb1e" explains the role of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in rendering 3D reconstructions and user "PaulHoule" agrees. "CharlesW" brings up a similar technique called Multi-View Stereo (MVS), and "blvscff" comments on the differentiable process of NeRFs.


ffstrf finds this interesting and speculates that it might be possible to leverage hacking services or replicate existing solutions that support machine learning.

The conversation ends without further comments.

Researchers have been using OpenAI's ChatGPT to write scientific papers without disclosing its use, leading to concerns about the integrity of peer-reviewed publications. ChatGPT is an AI chatbot that generates fluent text in response to user prompts. However, some researchers have been found to have used ChatGPT to help draft their manuscripts without declaring it. In one case, a paper was retracted by the journal Physica Scripta because the authors did not disclose their use of the tool. Since April, more than a dozen journal articles have been flagged for containing telltale ChatGPT phrases without proper disclosure. This raises concerns about the widespread use of AI language models in scientific publishing.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to the use of AI in scientific publishing. Some commenters express frustration with the current state of academic journals, noting that they are slow, expensive, and often prioritize profit over the dissemination of research. Others argue that the current peer review system is flawed and prone to biases and conflicts of interest. Some commenters defend the anonymity of peer reviewers, while others suggest alternative systems for collecting review data.

There is also a discussion about the use of AI in academia, with some commenters arguing that it can be a helpful tool for researchers, while others express concerns about its impact on the integrity of scientific publications. Some commenters posit that the problem lies not with AI itself, but with the lack of transparency and honesty among researchers in disclosing their use of AI tools.

Other points raised include the need for better document hosting services and functionality, the importance of replication in scientific publishing, and the systemic issues within the university system that may contribute to the current state of academic publishing.

Overall, the discussion reflects a variety of perspectives on the use of AI in scientific publishing and raises important questions about transparency, integrity, and the future of the peer review system.

### Large Language Models as Optimizers. +50% on Big Bench Hard

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03409) | 92 points | by [og_kalu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=og_kalu) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37434069)

Researchers from Google AI have proposed a new approach called Optimization by PROmpting (OPRO) that leverages large language models (LLMs) as optimizers for solving complex optimization problems. Traditional derivative-based optimization algorithms face challenges when dealing with tasks that lack gradients. OPRO uses LLMs to generate new solutions based on a prompt that contains previously generated solutions. These new solutions are then evaluated and added to the prompt for the next optimization step. The researchers demonstrate the effectiveness of OPRO on linear regression and traveling salesman problems. They also show that prompts optimized by OPRO outperform human-designed prompts by up to 8% on GSM8K and up to 50% on Big-Bench Hard tasks. The paper, "Large Language Models as Optimizers," is available for download.

The discussion surrounding the submission about Google AI's OPRO approach includes various viewpoints and comments. One commenter argues that traditional derivative-based optimization algorithms cannot handle tasks without gradients, but another points out that these distinctions are inventions and not necessarily applicable in the realm of technology. Another user brings up Microsoft's Tay as an example of the unpredictability of training models. 

There is also a discussion about the importance of understanding the underlying system and the role of advanced technology in distinguishing it from magic. Some users emphasize the potential capabilities of language models (LLMs), while others express the difficulty in comprehending LLMs and their workings due to the lack of mathematical details. 

Another user mentions Charlie Stross's similar submission from a month ago, which leads to a brief conversation about whether one can credibly learn a service in a short period of time. Another thread veers off-topic into discussing Skyrim, the internet in general, and breaking large problems into smaller ones. 

The next set of comments focuses on the paper itself. One commenter highlights that OPRO outperforms human-designed prompts, while another comments on the difficulty in understanding the paper beyond its "academic crust." There are some exchanges regarding the process of optimization and the potential of LLMs to handle optimization problems. One user suggests that LLMs might be able to offer insights into proving optimization problems, while another brings up the distinction between text-based models like PaLM and 2L-Thought. 

There is further discussion about the challenges of providing good prompts and the potential for LLMs to help explain their thinking process. One user mentions their related work on black-box optimization using LLMs. Finally, there is a brief conversation about solving Sudoku puzzles and the potential applications of LLMs in solving complex problems.
