### Multi-modal prompt injection image attacks against GPT-4V

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2023/Oct/14/multi-modal-prompt-injection/) | 204 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37877605)

The latest blog post by Simon Willison discusses the new GPT-4V model, which allows users to upload images as part of their conversations. While this feature brings about exciting possibilities, it also opens up a new avenue for prompt injection attacks. Willison provides several examples to illustrate this. In one instance, he uploads a photo from the "50th Annual World Championship Pumpkin Weigh-Off" and asks the model how big the pumpkin is. The model accurately deduces the weight based on the digital display next to the pumpkin. Another example shows how an image containing additional instructions can override the user's prompt and misdirect the model's response. Even more concerning is the use of visual prompt injection for exfiltration attacks. By including instructions in an image, an attacker can trick the model into leaking potentially private data to an external server. Willison points out that he was surprised to see this example work, as he had assumed OpenAI would have implemented safeguards against it. He also highlights an instance where a hidden prompt injection attack is embedded in an image. This attack goes unnoticed as the text blends with the background color. Willison concludes by emphasizing that prompt injection still remains a problem, as language models inherently rely on the instructions given to them. Given their gullibility, it is difficult to differentiate between good and bad instructions, making it an ongoing challenge to prevent prompt injection attacks.
