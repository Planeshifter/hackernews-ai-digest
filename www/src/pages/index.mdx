### Meilisearch expands search power with Arroy's filtered disk ANN

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.kerollmops.com/meilisearch-expands-search-power-with-arroy-s-filtered-disk-ann) | 71 points | by [Kerollmops](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Kerollmops) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38752060)

Meilisearch, a full-text search engine, is expanding its search capabilities with Arroy's filtered disk. In order to support filtering and selecting subsets of documents, Meilisearch needed to develop a filtering system that can handle large datasets and provide scalability and responsiveness. One of their clients required the ability to filter through over 100 million YouTube video metadata and associated image embeddings to select videos released within specific time frames. 

Previously, Meilisearch ranked only the subset of filtered documents, but now with Arroy's filtered disk, they needed to implement a more efficient method. They were using an in-memory HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) data structure, but it was inefficient. They had to deserialize the whole data structure in memory, which took a lot of time and memory. Additionally, Meilisearch supports multiple vectors by document, so they needed to look up every vector they were iterating, which was not ideal.

With Arroy, Meilisearch was able to integrate the new vector store more quickly through mob programming, where the team codes together at the same time. Arroy provided a smarter search engine that can determine the exact number of results to return, even with filters to consider.

Arroy's internal data structure consists of item nodes (original vectors), normal nodes (split planes), and descendant nodes (tree leaves composed of item IDs). During a search, the algorithm pops the nearest item from a binary heap associated with an infinite distance. The modified Arroy stores the list of descendants in RoaringBitmaps, which are more efficient and allow for easier intersection with the filtered subset of documents.

One challenge Meilisearch faced was that vector IDs are not the same as document IDs, and Meilisearch only knows about the documents after executing the filters. Iterating on a lookup table to construct the final bitmap with all the vector IDs corresponding to the filtered documents would not be efficient, especially when many documents are part of the subset. To address this, Meilisearch used multiple indexes for efficient filtering.

Overall, the integration of Arroy in Meilisearch improved their search tool and highlighted the importance of collaboration and teamwork when facing technical challenges.

There are several discussions taking place in the comments section of the submission about Meilisearch's integration of Arroy's filtered disk. Here is a summary of the key points:

- One commenter suggests that Meilisearch should provide more information about their indexing process, and another mentions that they should discuss it on Discord. It is noted that Meilisearch has improved its indexing speed in version 16, and links to blog posts and tweets are shared to provide more details.
- Another commenter mentions that they recently re-indexed comments in Meilisearch using PHP and synchronized the data with MYSQL. They also mention upgrading to the latest version and mention the indexing speed.
- There is a discussion about the use of RoaringBitmaps in Meilisearch. One commenter finds it interesting as it offers benefits such as memory traversal, while another commenter raises questions about the design choices and suggests considering benchmarks.
- The expansion of Meilisearch's hybrid search capabilities is mentioned, and one commenter agrees that it's a great addition. They also suggest that Meilisearch should consider introducing replication clusters for high availability.
- A commenter shares their plan to use Markdown Astro and Seveltkit SSG to generate an index for searching with Meilisearch.
- A brief discussion about the disk space improvement in Meilisearch is mentioned.
- The topic of product placement in the blog post is brought up by a commenter, to which the original poster replies that Meilisearch works hard and mentions the various search features in different versions.
- There is a suggestion to use bundled libraries like SQLite or PostgreSQL for Meilisearch's storage needs, and another commenter mentions running a local bundled app.

Overall, the comments discuss various aspects of Meilisearch's integration of Arroy's filtered disk, including indexing speed, design choices, hybrid search capabilities, storage solutions, and future developments.

### Direct initialization of transformers using larger pretrained ones

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09299) | 44 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38737262)

Researchers at Stanford University have developed a technique called weight subcloning, which allows for the direct initialization of smaller transformer models using weights from larger pretrained models. Training large transformers from scratch can be time-consuming and computationally demanding, so transfer learning is commonly used to initialize models with weights from pretrained models. However, if a pretrained model of the required size is not available, this approach becomes challenging. Weight subcloning addresses this problem by performing an operation on the pretrained model to obtain an initialized scaled-down model. This technique improves training speed and convergence for vision transformers in image classification and language models designed for next token prediction. The researchers achieved up to 4x faster training using weight subcloning compared to random initialization.

### Memory Safety Is a Red Herring

#### [Submission URL](https://steveklabnik.com/writing/memory-safety-is-a-red-herring) | 21 points | by [weinzierl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=weinzierl) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38732272)

In a recent blog post, the author reflects on the focus of memory safety in programming languages, particularly in the case of Rust. They argue that the distinction between memory safe languages (MSLs) and non-memory safe languages is not sufficient to capture the broader concept of safety in programming. While memory safety is important, it is not the only aspect to consider.

The author acknowledges that Rust's marketing has heavily emphasized memory safety, which has its merits. However, they wonder if it would have been better to highlight a more general concept of safety. They also express curiosity about the future of C++ successor languages in light of upcoming legislation that could mandate the use of MSLs in government procurement.

The author then addresses a question raised on Hacker News about Python's inclusion in the category of "memory safe" languages. They explain that while calling C from Python can introduce potential problems, the fault lies with the C code, not Python itself. Pure Python, they argue, is indeed memory safe. However, they admit that existing definitions of memory safety can be vague and unsatisfying.

The blog post also references a document published by the Five Eyes, which emphasizes the importance of memory safety in programming languages. It outlines memory safe programming languages (MSLs) that can eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities and mentions C and C++ as examples of memory unsafe languages. The document also recognizes that hybrid programming models, combining safe and unsafe languages, will be used for the foreseeable future.

In conclusion, the author raises thought-provoking questions about the definition and scope of memory safety in programming languages, highlighting the need to consider safety beyond just memory. They also mention the potential challenges and limitations in adopting MSLs in real-world scenarios.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's arguments and raises some additional points.

One user starts by mentioning that Swift and C++ have an interesting interoperability story, with Swift's compiler including Clang to support C++. They express surprise that the blog post didn't discuss the similarities between Swift and Rust, which they believe to be potential successors to C++.

Another user responds that Rust's focus on memory safety does not solve all the problems, as it still allows for potentially unsafe features like FFI and conditional panics. They argue that building safe abstractions in Rust requires taking abstraction layers seriously. They also mention their struggle with building quality abstractions in Swift and Java when it comes to FFI.

A different user brings up a relevant document published by the Five Eyes, which emphasizes the importance of memory safety in programming languages. They mention that the document lists C#, Java, Ruby, Rust, and Swift as examples of memory-safe languages. They later add that they found a European Union document mentioning Rust as well.

Another user highlights the importance of governments improving memory safety in technology, sharing anecdotes about their experience with government projects that encountered issues due to low-quality, insecure software. They express enthusiasm for Rust and its potential impact on government projects, but caution that the results may not be immediate.

The discussion then veers off into a clarification about Rust and the intention behind the blog post. One user mentions that they interpreted the post as suggesting Rust as a replacement for C++ in government projects, while another user expresses confusion and states that they believe the post doesn't make that claim.

Finally, a user flags the discussion as interesting and comments that it presents different points and raises thought-provoking questions.

He also mentions recent examples where new methods and insights have led to significant compute savings in the era of LLMs. While the largest models will continue to require extensive compute resources in the near term, there is still room for innovation and progress in the field by focusing on smaller models and areas where compute requirements can be reduced through research advancements.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to large language models (LLMs) in NLP research. Here are the main points discussed:

- One commenter mentions the high computational cost of LLM projects and refers to the TinyLlama project, which provides resources for training language models using affordable hardware.
- Another commenter talks about using older models like Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for NLP tasks, highlighting their smaller size and negligible inference time compared to LLMs.
- The question arises about why LLM research is focused on industry problems that require extensive resources. The commenter suggests that it may be because industry has more pre-graduate students conducting research, who are focused on efficient inference methods.
- Some commenters mention their personal projects and experiences with LLMs, including using them to analyze large datasets of human text data and using text embeddings for nearest neighbor search.
- The issue of function calling and benchmarking LLMs is discussed, with one commenter mentioning the challenge of classifying various types of backlogs in a dynamic classification system based on chunked data.
- There is a suggestion to use autolabeling tools and design smarter prompts to aid in creating backlogs for LLM models.
- The potential drawbacks and limitations of LLMs are also brought up, including the difficulty of extracting metadata and the need for a large number of examples for training.

Overall, the discussion covers a range of perspectives on LLM research, including challenges, alternative approaches, and potential improvements.

Meta's CTO, Andrew Bosworth, recently discussed how AI is shaping the company's future in augmented reality (AR) in an interview. Bosworth explained that generative AI has had a significant impact on Meta's product roadmap, particularly concerning their AR glasses. The latest version of Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses, which have gained popularity beyond early adopters, come equipped with an AI assistant that can identify objects and translate languages. Bosworth also revealed that the next iteration of the glasses, set for release in 2025, will include a "viewfinder" display that the AI assistant will utilize. This highlights Meta's belief that AI will become a primary way for people to interact with machines.

The discussion on this submission revolves around two main points. One user praises Meta's consistent leadership and its focus on AI and AR. They recommend watching Mark Zuckerberg's discussions on AI leadership as it relates to Meta's vision. Another user agrees with this statement, emphasizing the company's consistent approach and the importance of good leadership in the industry.

On the other hand, there are a few comments that raise concerns or questions. One user wonders if there is a content problem in Meta's recent staff acquisitions and suggests that solving VR alone may not be enough. Another user suggests that Facebook's DNA is to make popular physical devices, implying that Meta's focus on AI and AR may not align with the company's core strengths. There is also a link shared without any accompanying context, and one user simply responds with "dd," which is not clear in meaning.

Overall, the comments express a mix of admiration for Meta's consistent direction and some doubts or questions about the company's strategies and recent staff acquisitions.
