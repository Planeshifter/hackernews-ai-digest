### Honey, I shrunk {fmt}: bringing binary size to 14k and ditching the C++ runtime

#### [Submission URL](https://vitaut.net/posts/2024/binary-size/) | 236 points | by [karagenit](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=karagenit) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41415238)

In a recent exploration of the {fmt} formatting library, developers are thrilled to see its compact binary size continue to shrink—now boasting a reduced footprint of just 71KB after disabling locale support. The library, which is favored for its efficiency over traditional alternatives like IOStreams and Boost Format, leverages clever type-erasure techniques to streamline format operations, which not only enhances compile times but also minimizes the size of the resulting executable.

With its unique design, {fmt} ensures that formatting errors can be caught at compile time, thus offering more robust runtime safety compared to C-style printf. Developers have been investigating further optimizations, and in testing on an aarch64 Ubuntu system, they've observed a consistent ability to maintain smaller sizes despite recent upgrades, including the introduction of the Dragonbox algorithm for better floating-point formatting.

The focus on binary size isn't arbitrary; there's a growing appeal among developers working with memory-constrained systems—including retro computing enthusiasts—leading to more interest in creating a lightweight library. As the maintainers continue their work, the prospect of reducing the library size even further remains a key goal, benefitting not just traditional software development but also niche applications in older, resource-limited environments.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implementation and optimization of the {fmt} formatting library, particularly its ability to maintain a small binary size and its design principles. 

1. **Binary Size and C++ Standards**: Users discuss how the {fmt} library's default behavior contrasts with traditional C++ standards, particularly noting that the C++20 committee failed to address issues with default behaviors in formatting functions. Some participants express concern over the lack of consistency in the language's handling of localized settings and defaults.

2. **Floating Point Formatting**: The conversation highlights the introduction of the Dragonbox algorithm for improved floating-point formatting. Several users share their experiences and results of using the algorithm, emphasizing its efficiency compared to past methods and the benefits it brings in terms of performance.

3. **Comparison with Zig Language**: Users compare the {fmt} library with the Zig programming language, noting Zig's own approaches to floating-point formatting and binary size reduction. Comments point out how Zig's compiler generates smaller binaries due to its linking strategies.

4. **Compiler and Allocation Details**: There are deeper discussions about C++'s memory management and the impact of different allocators on binary size. Contributors debate best practices for managing defaults and constructors, suggesting various methods for optimizing allocation and reducing overhead.

5. **Performance Insights**: Some participants provide performance benchmarks and insights from their experiments with the {fmt} library, noting that smaller binary sizes could simplify deployment, especially in constrained environments. They also discuss the trade-offs related to performance gains versus code complexity.

Overall, the conversation reflects a keen interest in both the technical details of the {fmt} library's design and its alignment with broader trends in programming language development, particularly regarding efficiency and memory management in C++.

### 500 Python Interpreters

#### [Submission URL](https://izzys.casa/2024/08/463-python-interpreters/) | 158 points | by [SAHChandler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SAHChandler) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41403286)

As the programming world eagerly anticipates the arrival of Python 3.13, a renewed focus has emerged on the long-debated Global Interpreter Lock (GIL). The introduction of an optional GIL via PEP 703 could signal a significant shift in Python's performance, particularly for multithreaded applications—a long-held dream for many developers. Alongside this, PEP 684 offers a per-interpreter GIL, a new approach introduced in Python 3.12 that aims to enhance the concurrency model.

In an insightful post, a programmer reflects on their journey through Python's threading complexities, tracing back to a formative experience at a game development camp in 2005. It was there that they encountered, and vividly learned about, the GIL's notorious limitations—most notably when their attempts to use threading to optimize sprite loading resulted in slower performance. 

Drawing historical parallels, the author discusses how the GIL has shaped Python's C API and its usability in various applications, noting that even popular games like Civilization IV faced performance challenges due to this architectural decision. The post not only delves into the evolution of threading in Python but also highlights the dual efforts of the Python community to navigate and mitigate the GIL's impact.

With a personal anecdote to ground the technical overview, the writer emphasizes the ongoing struggle and frustration developers have faced over the years regarding Python's handling of concurrency, hinting at a brighter future with the new proposals on the horizon. As Python continues to evolve, the community is hopeful that these developments will finally pave the way for more efficient multithreading capabilities.

In the Hacker News discussion surrounding the anticipated Python 3.13 and its proposed changes to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), users engage in a deep exploration of the implications of PEP 703 and PEP 684. 

One user expresses excitement about the potential for improved multithreading capabilities, remarking on the challenging realities of Python’s threading system, especially in practical applications like game development. This sentiment is echoed by another participant, who asserts that regardless of the changes, developers will still need to navigate complexities with Python’s threading.

Several contributors debate the specifics of the GIL and its interaction with the Python interpreter, with one clarifying that PEP 684 allows for multiple CPython interpreters to operate without the GIL interfering in their independent states. There are humorous interjections about the challenges posed by threading, comparing them to pop culture references.

Discussions also touch on the technicalities of embedding interpreters and the performance implications, while some users joke about broader issues like HTTP status codes and project deployment challenges.

Overall, the exchange reflects a mix of optimism for Python's future capabilities, skepticism rooted in past experiences, and a community eager to contribute to the dialogue on making Python a better tool for multithreading and concurrency.
