### Supervised fine tuning on curated data is reinforcement learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856) | 66 points | by [GabrielBianconi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GabrielBianconi) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44727788)

Machine learning enthusiasts, take note: a new research paper spotted on arXiv, titled "Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)" by Chongli Qin and Jost Tobias Springenberg, offers intriguing insights into the realms of behavior cloning and supervised fine-tuning. The authors argue that the common practice of using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated data can actually be seen as a form of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically within a sparse reward context.

What's exciting is the introduction of a novel approach called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which tweaks the traditional SFT method to optimize a tighter RL objective. This simple yet effective modification can enhance performance by aligning more closely with RL training methods.

Illustrating its potential, the iw-SFT variant shows competitive results, matching up against advanced RL algorithms, especially in tasks involving large language models and continuous control tasks. It even managed to achieve an admirable 66.7% performance on the AIME 2024 dataset. For those interested in diving deeper, complete details and the code are available through the project's website.

This development holds promise for anyone working with large language models or imitation learning, as it bridges the gap between classical supervised learning and reinforcement learning, potentially unlocking new avenues for enhancing model performance.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Practical Applications & Cost Savings**:  
   User **nndvsn** highlights experiments showing that fine-tuning smaller models on curated outputs from larger models drastically reduces inference costs (30x lower) and speeds up performance (4x faster). Tests involved navigation, RAG, and multi-hop QA tasks. The approach competes with closed-source (OpenAI, Google) and open-source models (Qwen), suggesting small models can rival large ones at a fraction of the cost.

2. **Code Sharing & Tooling**:  
   The authors (e.g., **chnglqn**, likely Chongli Qin) shared a GitHub link to the iw-SFT code. **GabrielBianconi** mentioned a related GPU-optimization tool (Unsloth) and an ongoing pull request for further integration.

3. **Technical Debates on RL vs. SFT**:  
   - **ndnfrth** and **mtrngd** questioned framing SFT as RL, arguing RL involves sequential decision-making, not just single-step optimization. **mtrngd** critiqued conflating SFT with Q-Learning, noting RL's focus on cumulative rewards.  
   - **chnglqn** countered that their method uses REINFORCE-style policy gradients to bridge SFT and RL, particularly in sparse-reward settings (common in LLMs).

4. **Benchmark Critique**:  
   **stlncd** criticized the paper’s 66.7% score on AIME 2024, comparing it to a "D-" grade and noting it’s a 12th-grade-level benchmark. Others (**sprmdgy**, **jpcmprtr**) countered that modest results are still valuable, with **stlncd** later conceding it might equate to a "B+" relative to students.

5. **Industry Context**:  
   **hnrqgdy** emphasized the potential for smaller, distilled models to address compliance and communication issues in enterprises. **jtsprngnbrg** (Jost Springenberg) clarified the work was an independent effort (not an official DeepMind project), sparking interest in its origins.

**Key Takeaways**:

The community values code accessibility and sees potential in distilling smaller models, though debates around methodology and evaluation persist.

### Playing with Open Source LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://alicegg.tech//2025/07/29/open-source-llm.html) | 73 points | by [zer0tonin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zer0tonin) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44726838)

In a world where AI advancements are rolling in like waves on a beach, our intrepid coder decides to venture out of their comfort zone every six months to explore the latest tools. This time, the buzz was around AI-enhanced command-line tools, specifically tailored for writing code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Entering the spotlight is Claude Code, a tool that promises full autonomy in coding activities, from searching to committing code. However, our reluctant tech enthusiast remains wary of investing in potentially temporary vendor solutions.

To avoid getting trapped in costly or evolving services, they embarked on a journey through the open-source landscape in search of a suitable LLM for coding tasks. They tested various models, including the popular deepseek-r1:8b from China, the French contender mistral:7b, and Alibaba's qwen3:8b. After much trial and error, the qwen3:8b emerged as the favored model due to its balance between accuracy and usability on local setups.

For running these models locally, the coder set up an API using Ollama, a tool likened to Docker but specifically for LLMs, offering an easy way to manage and run these models. With the local API ready, they paired it with 'aider,' a pair programming application designed to work collaboratively with the model. Aider aids in passing context, running linters, and making code changes.

Our explorer then put the setup to the test. In a refactoring task within the Itako project, aider managed to make the instructed changes but ventured outside the task’s scope—a reminder of the tool's current developmental stage. Despite the intrigue, the time investment didn't justify the marginal output improvement for small tasks. For a fresh, greenfield project, however, the coder is keen to see what their new digital assistant can accomplish, leaving endless possibilities and hopefully more productive coding sessions on the horizon.

This adventure reflects the perpetual journey of developers in keeping pace with technological evolution, always weighing the complexities of AI tools against their practical benefits. As the coder retires to their proverbial cave, they do so with fresh insights and a renewed toolkit for future coding endeavors.

While these models can generate functional code, smaller models (e.g., 8B) struggle with complex coding tasks compared to larger ones. However, they remain cost-effective for basic usage or specific applications like text processing.
   - Skepticism persists about whether small models will ever match the performance of larger counterparts, though advances like "mixture of experts" architectures and distillation techniques offer hope.

2. **Open-Source Definitions for AI Models:**
   - Debate erupted over what qualifies an AI model as "open-source." Critics argued that the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has relaxed standards by not requiring training data release, leading to models like Llama being labeled "open" despite opaque training processes.
   - Some users emphasized that true openness requires releasing not just weights and inference code, but also training data, preprocessing scripts, and documentation to enable reproducibility. Others countered that practical constraints (e.g., legal issues with web-scraped data) make full transparency unrealistic.

3. **Local vs. Cloud Trade-offs:**
   - Running models locally saves costs and avoids vendor lock-in but demands significant hardware resources. Users highlighted tools like Ollama for local LLM management, though cost-benefit trade-offs arise when comparing local setups to cloud-based, proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT).

4. **Ethical and Transparency Concerns:**
   - Concerns were raised about "Trojan horse" risks with closed training data, where models might inadvertently include biased or harmful content. Proposals for stricter open-model criteria included licensing guardrails (e.g., O-RAIL) and auditability of training corpora.

5. **Industry Dynamics:**
   - Criticisms targeted tech companies for co-opting "open-source" branding without meeting traditional standards (e.g., Meta’s Llama license restrictions). Calls were made for new frameworks (e.g., "Fair Software") to address gaps between AI models and classic open-source software principles.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a community grappling with the rapid evolution of AI tools, balancing excitement over local, open-source LLMs with frustrations over definitions of openness and skepticism about their current limitations compared to proprietary alternatives.

### LLMs can now identify public figures in images

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/07/llms-identify-people/) | 40 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715132)

Imagine transforming the way we search for images by using a pipeline to represent them as semantic structured data through multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). An innovative project explores this concept, starting from a straightforward test: identifying public figures in images, like President Barack Obama, using various LLMs. 

In a detailed experiment, several models were put to the test. ChatGPT and Claude, known for their cautious privacy policies, initially stumbled when tasked with identifying President Obama. These models have strict guidelines potentially preventing them from recognizing individuals, which might stem from a strong emphasis on AI safety and privacy.

In contrast, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and models from Alibaba and Mistral showed no such hesitation and accurately identified notable figures. This divergence likely results from different training methods and reinforcement learning strategies among the LLMs. The results suggest that some models might handle privacy less strictly, especially when identifying well-known personalities.

Further tests involved less famous individuals, such as the author, who wasn't recognized by any model, re-affirming their criteria for notability. However, when analyzing an image of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, only some models successfully identified both figures, revealing differences not only in recognition capabilities but also in spatial awareness and ordering.

Through these experiments, the project underscores the varied performance and strategies of LLMs in image recognition and categorization. It opens up a discussion on privacy, training protocols, and the potential of LLMs in enhancing image searching and tagging through semantic data structuring. This study is a stepping stone for future explorations into integrating multimodal LLMs for more sophisticated and practical applications in image identification.

### Why not Matrix (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://telegra.ph/why-not-matrix-08-07) | 38 points | by [throwachimera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwachimera) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714994)

Matrix, the "open network for decentralized communication," has generated buzz in the tech community for its promise of providing a free, federated platform. While many projects have shifted from platforms like IRC, Discord, and Slack to embrace Matrix, the system's underlying complexity and privacy challenges present a few potential drawbacks.

At its core, Matrix functions as a distributed, partially-replicated graph database. Users interact in "rooms," which are actually directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where events like messages and user actions form an append-only history. Although this structure ensures persistent records, it also implies that data accumulation is inevitable, complicating data deletion efforts—not ideal for applications requiring privacy and confidentiality.

The append-only nature of Matrix means events can't be easily erased. When deletions are needed, users can send "redaction events" requesting other servers to wipe specific data, but these requests can be ignored. A misbehaving server could retain and potentially share this supposedly deleted information, posing privacy risks.

Spam attacks are another threat, as joining the room with numerous bots can create a complex graph, burdening servers and client systems alike—particularly in encrypted rooms. To alleviate spam, recreating a room is often necessary.

Moreover, synchronizing room history across servers introduces inconsistency. Since the system relies on causal ordering and tiebreakers that can be tampered with, different servers might display messages in varying sequences, creating discrepancies in chat history.

While Matrix offers optional end-to-end encryption, it's necessary to maintain manageable public room operations but highlights a tradeoff in privacy. Unencrypted data can spread across servers in plaintext, making careful client-level encryption essential for private conversations.

Despite these concerns, the potential of Matrix's decentralized approach and open standard still holds significant appeal. As the network continues to evolve, addressing the enumerated challenges could solidify its standing as a robust, privacy-conscious communication platform.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around **Matrix** highlights mixed sentiments, balancing its potential as a decentralized platform with persistent technical and usability concerns:

1. **Technical Challenges & Improvements**:
   - Users acknowledge efforts to improve **end-to-end encryption (E2EE)** and data deletion (e.g., redaction events). However, skepticism remains around encryption fragility, unresolved bugs (e.g., "Unable to Decrypt" errors), and reliance on client compliance for security.
   - The Matrix team ("Arathorn") points to updates in 2024 addressing security, spam, and synchronization, including stricter server-client protocols and better history management. Critics argue issues like inconsistent message ordering and server trust persist.

2. **Client Ecosystem & Usability**:
   - Building reliable clients is seen as challenging, though projects using **Rust libraries** or protocols like **Simplex** (privacy-focused) receive praise. Official clients (e.g., Element) face criticism for **under-documented features** and poor user experience compared to Signal or Slack.

3. **Adoption vs. Centralization**:
   - Matrix's adoption by **European governments** (France, Germany) adds credibility but raises concerns about centralized control through large institutional deployments.
   - Alternatives like **XMPP** are suggested, though Matrix’s federated design is still favored by some for its decentralization.

4. **Privacy & Trust Concerns**:
   - Data retention and server compliance remain issues: malicious servers can ignore deletion requests, and unencrypted public rooms risk data exposure.
   - Comparisons to **Signal's protocol** highlight gaps in metadata privacy and encryption robustness, with doubts about Matrix’s ability to fully replace centralized platforms.

5. **Community Sentiment**:
   - Supporters praise Matrix for **self-hosting** and avoiding corporate surveillance, while critics stress its complexity and unfinished feel. User experiences vary widely, from seamless chats to frustration with sync issues and spam.

**Conclusion**: Matrix is seen as a promising but evolving platform, grappling with decentralization trade-offs and technical growing pains. While improvements are noted, trust in its ecosystem depends on resolving encryption quirks, enhancing client quality, and ensuring consistent privacy controls.
