The history of AI is a rollercoaster ride of hype and disillusionment, a cycle that seems to repeat itself with each new innovation. Scientists develop a novel mechanism, labeled as N, which requires significant computing resources and holds great promise. Funding pours in, leading to immediate results and revolutionary possibilities for machine cognition. The term "Artificial Intelligence" gets thrown around liberally, encompassing a wide range of technologies.

However, as time passes, overblown claims give way to skepticism, and the limitations of N become apparent. Competent practitioners quietly distance themselves from the AI label, and users start using more specific terms. Eventually, as computing power advances and products are released to underwhelming reception, investors lose interest, leading to a pivot away from AI towards other fields.

This pattern has repeated with previous technologies like neural networks in the 1950s and deep learning in the 2010s. Each cycle produces valuable technology but ultimately follows a predictable curve of rapid progress, followed by gradual improvement, and then a plateau. The AI hype cycle continues, with each new innovation becoming the next big thing before fading into the background as a more precise mechanism emerges.

The discussion on the submission delves into the current state of AI progress and the hype surrounding it. Here are the key points from the comments:

1. **krrs** suggests that AI might be causing more harm than good by bringing a cycle of destruction longer than expected. They express concerns about AI potentially giving certain individuals direct access to powerful tools with limitations that cannot be easily solved.

2. **mrtndbp** expresses confusion about the current state of AI progress, comparing it to expert systems. They emphasize the importance of logical reasoning and principles in AI development, suggesting that AI advancements may not be as significant as hyped.

3. **dmvdg** engages in a debate about the mismatch between expert systems and hype in AI. They discuss the hype cycle in the AI field and point out the overstatements made by evangelists and marketers over the years. They emphasize the decline of hype over time.

4. **mrtndbp** argues against the validation of hype in technology, implying that hype does not dictate the actual technological advancements. They counter arguments about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) claiming it might be overestimated similar to historical events like the invention of the nuclear bomb. They speculate about missing components for AGI similar to scaling laws in nuclear reactions.

5. **cntvnblzc** humorously mentions a link to the Theranos scandal in response to the discussions about overhyped technology.

6. **DerCommodore** flags the submission, possibly indicating some issue or violation.

Overall, the comments touch on skepticism towards the current state of AI progress, debate on the impact of hype, and humorous references to past technological scandals like Theranos.
