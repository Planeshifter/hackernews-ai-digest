Signal, known for its top-tier security in messaging apps, has further improved user privacy with the introduction of usernames. In response to government data requests, Signal stood firm by providing only the creation and last connection dates of an account, the only data it has access to. The addition of usernames allows users to communicate without sharing phone numbers by default, a significant improvement, especially for activists and journalists concerned about privacy. Signal's implementation of usernames is built on robust encryption, ensuring minimal user data is stored, reflecting its commitment to user privacy.

With the new feature, users can change their usernames at will, preventing the disclosure of sensitive information in the event of a subpoena. Usernames are currently available on Signal Desktop and beta mobile apps and will be rolled out more widely soon, adding a layer of anonymity for users. The discussion on the Hacker News submission regarding Signal's new username feature delves into various aspects such as the reuse of usernames, the potential security risks, and the implications of Signal collecting phone numbers. Users discuss the potential scenarios where persistent attackers could collect publicly visible usernames and change them, deeming Signal's feature to be non-reusable to address this issue.

Furthermore, there are detailed explanations on how usernames function within Signal, with users suggesting improvements in handling privacy concerns related to hashed values and contact sharing. Some users express concerns about trusting Signal due to potential design flaws, while others emphasize the significance of maintaining privacy and security in communications. The discussion also touches on the considerations of Signal collecting phone numbers, highlighting the implications in combating spam and the trade-offs between privacy and security. Users analyze Signal's approach to privacy and the measures taken to prevent unwanted contact requests while offering suggestions for improvement in protecting user data. Additionally, the conversation delves into technical aspects such as source code transparency and the challenges of implementing SMS services at scale.

Overall, the discussion showcases a mix of perspectives on Signal's new feature, privacy concerns, security implications, and the trade-offs between usability and safeguarding user information.

### Nvidia bans using translation layers for CUDA software to run on other chips

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/nvidia-bans-using-translation-layers-for-cuda-software-to-run-on-other-chips-new-restriction-apparently-targets-zluda-and-some-chinese-gpu-makers) | 288 points | by [justinclift](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=justinclift) | [138 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39592689)

Nvidia has recently updated its licensing terms to ban running CUDA-based software on non-Nvidia hardware platforms using translation layers. This move aims to prevent initiatives like ZLUDA and some Chinese GPU makers from utilizing CUDA code with translation layers. While this restriction is designed to maintain Nvidia's dominance in the accelerated computing space, it also opens up opportunities for competitors like AMD and Intel to attract software developers to their platforms. Recompiling existing CUDA programs remains legal, and both AMD and Intel offer tools to port CUDA programs to their platforms. As the competition in the GPGPU arena intensifies, the future dynamics of the industry remain uncertain.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding Nvidia's updated licensing terms to ban running CUDA-based software on non-Nvidia hardware platforms using translation layers involves various viewpoints. One user highlighted the restrictive nature of Nvidia's move, drawing comparisons to Microsoft's past legal battles, while another pointed out that the EULA changed in 2021 to specifically address the ban on running CUDA software on non-Nvidia platforms via translation layers. The conversation also delves into the legal implications of recompiling CUDA programs and the competitive opportunities this restriction might create for AMD and Intel. Users discuss the potential impact on the GPGPU industry and question the motivations behind Nvidia's decision. Additionally, there are comments expressing skepticism about the claims made in the article and debates about the ethical implications of Nvidia's actions and potential legal ramifications related to disassembling code.

### Film Companies Seek 'Torrenting History' Related to Redditor

#### [Submission URL](https://torrentfreak.com/film-companies-seek-torrenting-history-related-to-redditor-240220/) | 74 points | by [gslin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gslin) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39587550)

In a recent legal battle, film companies are seeking "torrenting history" related to a Redditor who commented on piracy topics. Reddit initially resisted revealing user data to protect anonymity but later shared some information. The filmmakers are not pursuing legal action against the Redditors but are seeking evidence for a piracy lawsuit against RCN. They are now pressing for detailed information on the Redditor's communications with RCN, payment records, torrenting activities, and social media usernames. The movie companies argue this data is crucial to prove direct copyright infringement. The court has yet to respond to their motion to compel the Redditor to comply with the subpoena. This case sheds light on the extensive information sought by movie companies in piracy lawsuits.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the legal battle where film companies are seeking "torrenting history" related to a Redditor who commented on piracy topics. Some users debate whether pursuing the Reddit user for downloading movies via BitTorrent is worth the legal resources. Others discuss the widespread nature of torrenting and suggest that providing affordable legal alternatives like Steam and Netflix could curb piracy. The conversation also delves into the implications of cracking down on torrenting, the impact of private trackers, and the consequences of not complying with legal requests. Some users point out the complexities of ISPs being involved in piracy lawsuits and the potential involvement of organized piracy schemes. The discussion also touches on the legality of court proceedings and the significance of evidence in legal investigations.
