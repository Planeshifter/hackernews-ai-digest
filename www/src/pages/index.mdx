### Bayesian Flow Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037) | 81 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37134315)

A new paper titled "Bayesian Flow Networks" introduces a new class of generative models called Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs). BFNs modify the parameters of independent distributions using Bayesian inference based on noisy data samples. These modified parameters are then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. This generative procedure is similar to the reverse process of diffusion models but simpler since no forward process is required. The paper derives discrete and continuous-time loss functions for different types of data and proposes sample generation procedures. BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling and outperform existing discrete diffusion models on a character-level language modeling task. The network inputs for discrete data are on the probability simplex, making it possible to use gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains like language modeling. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### What coal and Jevons’ paradox tell us about AI and data

#### [Submission URL](https://hex.tech/blog/jevons-paradox-demand-for-insight/) | 70 points | by [erehweb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erehweb) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129853)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the future of data jobs. Will computers replace human data practitioners? According to a blog post by Barry McCardel, the job of a data practitioner is more than just writing code or making charts. It involves formulating the right questions, anticipating the needs of stakeholders, and providing valuable insights. While AI can automate certain rote tasks, it is unlikely to replace the human element of data work.

McCardel draws a parallel to Jevons' Paradox, which observed that as coal-powered engines became more efficient, overall coal consumption increased. The same rebound effect could apply to AI and data. As the cost of generating insights decreases, the demand for data work and the number of questions that can be answered with data will likely increase. Organizations are supply-constrained when it comes to utilizing data, and AI can help unlock the untapped potential of data teams.

While AI will undoubtedly change how data practitioners work, McCardel argues that it will likely lead to an increased need for human hours rather than a decrease. The impact of data on organizations is far from reaching its theoretical limit, and AI can help data teams be more impactful. McCardel concludes by discussing Hex, a platform that enables the creation and sharing of interactive data products, and invites readers to explore opportunities with the company.

Overall, the blog post highlights the potential of AI to augment rather than replace human data practitioners, and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's main points about AI and the future of data jobs. One commenter agrees with the post, saying that AI may take over low-value tasks but will not replace the higher-level strategic work that humans can do. They argue that as technology progresses, there is a shift in the types of jobs available. Another commenter brings up the concern that AI may replace non-essential service vendors and result in organizational changes. 

There is also a discussion about the impact of automation on different types of jobs. Some argue that AI will lead to an increase in the need for human hours rather than a decrease. Others point out that certain jobs, like manual labor, may be more easily replaced by automation, while others believe that higher-skilled jobs will still be in demand. The potential impact on the middle class is also mentioned.

Another comment highlights the importance of natural language communication, social and emotional intelligence, and decision-making in certain professions, suggesting that AI may not fully replace these roles. However, another commenter challenges this notion, stating that AI has the potential to approximate decision-makers and replace jobs traditionally done by lower-skilled workers. They argue that humans are not horses and will adapt to new roles.

There is also a discussion about the current and future job market and the creation of new roles. Some argue that the current job market is not representative of the future, and there is uncertainty about the impact of AI on employment.

### Aurora I/O optimized config saved 90% DB cost

#### [Submission URL](https://graphite.dev/blog/how-an-aws-aurora-feature-cut-db-costs) | 128 points | by [fosterfriends](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fosterfriends) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37079909)

In a recent blog post, Greg Foster, the CTO of a company called Graphite, shared how a new feature of AWS Aurora helped them reduce their database costs by 90%. Graphite's data is stored on Amazon Aurora Postgres, and due to their bidirectional sync with GitHub, their database load is larger than usual for a startup of their size. This was resulting in high costs, with Aurora accounting for over 80% of their AWS bill. 

Initially, they explored using Aurora Serverless to reduce costs by only paying for capacity consumed. However, their constant ingestion of updates from GitHub required a large instance size, which made it more expensive than using a fixed size instance. They were also not in need of automatic upscaling and downscaling capabilities.

Then, in May, AWS released a new feature called "Aurora I/O Optimized" that directly addressed their high I/O costs. It offered up to 40% cost savings by charging a slightly higher storage rate but no I/O charges. After migrating to I/O Optimized, Graphite saw a whopping 90% reduction in costs.

The migration process was straightforward, which involved converting existing clusters with a few clicks in the console, using the CLI, or AWS's SDK. When they reached out to AWS to find out why this feature was built, they discovered that the Aurora team wanted to enable more customers to run heavier I/O workloads without worrying about the costs.

Foster concludes the blog post by encouraging readers to monitor their AWS bills, experiment with cost optimization, and stay updated on new features and updates from their database provider.
