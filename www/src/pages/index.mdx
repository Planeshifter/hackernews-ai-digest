### Does the Bitter Lesson Have Limits?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/08/01/does-the-bitter-lesson-have-limits.html) | 165 points | by [dbreunig](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbreunig) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44762022)

The “Bitter Lesson” coined by AI researcher Rich Sutton, suggests that general methods leveraging computation trump human-centric approaches in the long term success of technology advancements. But why is this approach considered bitter? According to Sutton, the success comes at the cost of going against our preferred human-centric methods, which initially deliver personal satisfaction and short-term success but plateau over time. Historical lessons from fields like computer chess, Go, and speech recognition demonstrate that it’s the scaling of computation and learning, rather than built-in knowledge, that propels significant breakthroughs.

This concept echoes Donna Haraway's theories on the ‘blows to the human ego’—realizations that unsettle human dominance, like Copernicus’s heliocentrism or Darwin’s evolution. In this light, AI’s capabilities challenge yet another facet of human centrality, suggesting that perhaps humans aren't as pivotal in creative processes as once believed—a notion resonated by Neil deGrasse Tyson’s thinking.

Ethan Mollick explores this further by contrasting Sutton's bitter lesson with the "Garbage Can Model" of organizational theory, highlighting how organizations often operate in chaos rather than planned methods. Organizations are messy and unpredictable compared to fields like chess or Go where the “win” conditions are clear. Mollick proposes that for AI to thrive in such a chaotic environment, organizations must adequately define quality and provide ample real-world data examples—no easy feat given the reductionist nature of data and the often vague objectives of organizations.

This resurfacing of the bitter lesson is met with skepticism revolving around the quality and clarity of data required in complex environments like businesses. Unlike games where objectives are clear and data is rich, organizational processes are often undocumented and multilayered, making AI adaptation challenging. Metrics, often used to measure objectives, can reduce complex ideas to simplistic data points, leading to potential manipulation or misinterpretation.

In essence, the Bitter Lesson serves as a reflection point on the limitations and possibilities of AI, urging us to reconsider how we define and measure success in the world of technology—a world where being human may no longer hold the central significance it once did.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on Rich Sutton’s *Bitter Lesson* and Ethan Mollick’s *Garbage Can Model* explores nuanced perspectives and critiques of AI's reliance on computational scaling versus human-centric methods. Key points include:

1. **Technical Debates on Efficiency**:  
   - Users discussed applications like autonomous drones using small neural networks (MLPs) to bypass traditional control theory (e.g., Model Predictive Control). While scalable, critics noted limitations in scenarios requiring physical insights or sensor-data interpretation, where classical methods excel. Anomaly detection research was flagged as potentially misleading, with simple classical techniques (e.g., FFT-based analysis) sometimes outperforming deep learning despite claims to the contrary.

2. **Challenges in Organizational Contexts**:  
   - Skepticism emerged about applying AI to chaotic environments (per the Garbage Can Model). Unlike structured domains (chess, Go), organizations lack clear objectives and data quality, risking reductionist metrics that misrepresent complex goals. Users highlighted cases where ML solutions failed due to undocumented processes or the inability to translate vague objectives into training data.

3. **Hybrid Approaches in Robotics and AI**:  
   - Historical debates resurfaced on merging reactive and deliberative control architectures in robotics. Modern systems, like Stockfish (chess) combining neural networks with search algorithms, illustrate hybrid success. However, concerns arose about mainstream AI’s trajectory, particularly LLMs and AGI speculation, fearing over-reliance on "test-time compute" might sideline fundamental engineering.

4. **Hardware and Financial Limits**:  
   - Users questioned whether computational scaling faces inevitable bottlenecks, citing semiconductor manufacturing’s rising costs (e.g., ASML’s EUV lithography challenges). This contrasts Sutton’s optimism, suggesting financial or physical constraints might disrupt the Bitter Lesson’s assumption of infinite scaling.

5. **Tension Between Paradigms**:  
   - While Sutton’s lesson emphasizes general methods, comments argued for context-aware hybrid models. Examples included vibration analysis in SaaS products, where ML supplements (but doesn’t replace) domain expertise, and molecular dynamics simulations using neural networks to approximate expensive calculations.

**Conclusion**:  
The discussion paints the Bitter Lesson as a valuable heuristic but stresses its limitations in messy, real-world contexts. Hybrid models, contextual awareness, and data quality are critical, while hardware and financial realities may temper unchecked computational optimism. The broader takeaway: AI’s evolution hinges on balancing scalable methods with domain-specific insights, avoiding oversimplification of complex problems.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Ambiguity Around API Access Terminology**:  
   Users debated the distinction between "special developer access" and standard API usage. Some clarified that "special" might refer to restricted tiers or scenarios (e.g., internal tools), while others argued the phrasing was exaggerated. Comparisons were drawn to "firefighter elevator buttons" to highlight nuanced access levels, with criticism of *Wired* for potentially sensationalizing the term "special."  

2. **ToS Restrictions and Industry Norms**:  
   Anthropic’s terms of service (ToS) barring the use of their services to build competing products were noted as standard practice among major tech firms (Google, Microsoft, Meta). Critics likened this to historical EULAs (e.g., Apple, Oracle) that restrict reverse engineering or competition, arguing such terms entrench dependency and stifle innovation.  

3. **OpenAI’s Actions and Ethical Implications**:  
   While some defended Anthropic’s response as justified if OpenAI breached ToS, others criticized the move as counterproductive for AI safety research. Users pointed out the irony of Anthropic limiting access given its emphasis on ethical AI, with frustration over stifling benchmarks critical for model evaluation.  

4. **Media and Technical Literacy**:  
   Commenters highlighted potential miscommunication in *Wired*’s reporting, noting non-technical readers might misinterpret "special developer access." Technical users stressed the difference between APIs (for integration) and SDKs (tools for developers), questioning whether OpenAI’s use fell outside standard benchmarking.  

5. **Broader Industry Dynamics**:  
   Comparisons to past incidents (Facebook/Vine, Salesforce/Slack) underscored recurring tensions in tech around API access control. Some speculated Anthropic’s decision reflected commercial priorities over collaborative research, while others lamented the trend toward proprietary "walled gardens" in AI development.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects divided opinions on balancing competitive safeguards with open innovation, skepticism toward media framing of technical disputes, and concerns about corporate control shaping the future of AI research.

### The AI age is the "age of no consent"

#### [Submission URL](https://productpicnic.beehiiv.com/p/the-ai-age-is-the-age-of-no-consent-7559) | 74 points | by [BallsInIt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BallsInIt) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44759904)

In the thought-provoking article "The AI Age is the 'Age of No Consent'," author Pavel Samsonov delves deep into the unsettling transformation brought on by AI technology—where user consent and needs take a backseat to the supposed "inevitability" of AI-driven design. Samsonov paints a compelling picture of how product managers and designers have increasingly replaced genuine user feedback with AI tools like GPT, leading to an environment where technology, not human needs, dictates the narrative.

The paradox highlighted is stark: while AI tools claim to enhance user experience, they effectively diminish user agency. Rather than serving as instruments of empowerment, they warp the user experience to fit predefined AI-centric outcomes. Samsonov critiques this shift, emphasizing that AI has made it so users are no longer given the choice to opt out; instead, AI's omnipresence forces engagement, subtly embedding itself into all facets of life. Even more concerning is the ethical dilemma posed by AI's reliance on vast troves of data, often scraped without consent or compensation, effectively disregarding intellectual property rights and user autonomy.

The article points out AI's subtle yet pervasive influence, infiltrating decisions and outputs in daily life without explicit permission. Despite the illusion of merely being a tool, AI systems are embedded with biases and logics that steer users' actions, often skewing towards surveillance and control rather than empowerment and freedom.

This exposé calls for a reconciliation of technological development with ethical responsibility, pleading for a return to a time where user needs and consent dictate design, urging stakeholders to rethink the trajectory of AI's role in our lives imminently.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around ethical and societal concerns regarding AI's growing influence, emphasizing themes of consent, data exploitation, and systemic inequality. Key points include:

1. **Consent & Data Ethics**:  
   - Criticisms target AI companies for bypassing user consent, referencing scandals like **Cambridge Analytica** and the scraping of data/IP without permission. Users liken data commodification to a loss of freedom, with one noting the irony that "information wants to be free" yet is increasingly controlled by corporations.

2. **Social Inequality & Class Divides**:  
   - Debates touch on wealth accumulation, **social Darwinism**, and historical parallels (e.g., the **French Revolution**), warning of growing class divides. References to "noblesse oblige" highlight tensions between privilege and responsibility in tech-driven societies.

3. **Authoritarian Fears & Historical Parallels**:  
   - Users draw dystopian comparisons to **fascism** and **Nazi singularity**, arguing unchecked AI could enable suppression, control, and a "brave new world" of authoritarianism. Concerns include AI amplifying surveillance and eroding democracy.

4. **Critique of Tech Culture**:  
   - Tech ecosystems are accused of fostering narcissism, extremism, and a lack of empathy. Discussions criticize the prioritization of profit over ethics, with AI development framed as detached from human values.

5. **Ownership & Proprietary Models**:  
   - Issues around data ownership arise, with mentions of AI systems using scraped content to reproduce outputs, undermining original creators. Proprietary AI models are seen as centralizing power and stifling transparency.

6. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Some users flag the article’s alarmist tone, while others find value in its warnings. Abstract terms like "cognitive dissonance" and "selective ignorance" describe societal complacency toward AI’s risks.

**Overall Tone**: Largely critical and anxious, with calls for ethical accountability and systemic reform to prevent AI from exacerbating societal divides and authoritarian tendencies.

### Supervised fine tuning on curated data is reinforcement learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856) | 66 points | by [GabrielBianconi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GabrielBianconi) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44727788)

Machine learning enthusiasts, take note: a new research paper spotted on arXiv, titled "Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)" by Chongli Qin and Jost Tobias Springenberg, offers intriguing insights into the realms of behavior cloning and supervised fine-tuning. The authors argue that the common practice of using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated data can actually be seen as a form of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically within a sparse reward context.

What's exciting is the introduction of a novel approach called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which tweaks the traditional SFT method to optimize a tighter RL objective. This simple yet effective modification can enhance performance by aligning more closely with RL training methods.

Illustrating its potential, the iw-SFT variant shows competitive results, matching up against advanced RL algorithms, especially in tasks involving large language models and continuous control tasks. It even managed to achieve an admirable 66.7% performance on the AIME 2024 dataset. For those interested in diving deeper, complete details and the code are available through the project's website.

This development holds promise for anyone working with large language models or imitation learning, as it bridges the gap between classical supervised learning and reinforcement learning, potentially unlocking new avenues for enhancing model performance.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Practical Applications & Cost Savings**:  
   User **nndvsn** highlights experiments showing that fine-tuning smaller models on curated outputs from larger models drastically reduces inference costs (30x lower) and speeds up performance (4x faster). Tests involved navigation, RAG, and multi-hop QA tasks. The approach competes with closed-source (OpenAI, Google) and open-source models (Qwen), suggesting small models can rival large ones at a fraction of the cost.

2. **Code Sharing & Tooling**:  
   The authors (e.g., **chnglqn**, likely Chongli Qin) shared a GitHub link to the iw-SFT code. **GabrielBianconi** mentioned a related GPU-optimization tool (Unsloth) and an ongoing pull request for further integration.

3. **Technical Debates on RL vs. SFT**:  
   - **ndnfrth** and **mtrngd** questioned framing SFT as RL, arguing RL involves sequential decision-making, not just single-step optimization. **mtrngd** critiqued conflating SFT with Q-Learning, noting RL's focus on cumulative rewards.  
   - **chnglqn** countered that their method uses REINFORCE-style policy gradients to bridge SFT and RL, particularly in sparse-reward settings (common in LLMs).

4. **Benchmark Critique**:  
   **stlncd** criticized the paper’s 66.7% score on AIME 2024, comparing it to a "D-" grade and noting it’s a 12th-grade-level benchmark. Others (**sprmdgy**, **jpcmprtr**) countered that modest results are still valuable, with **stlncd** later conceding it might equate to a "B+" relative to students.

5. **Industry Context**:  
   **hnrqgdy** emphasized the potential for smaller, distilled models to address compliance and communication issues in enterprises. **jtsprngnbrg** (Jost Springenberg) clarified the work was an independent effort (not an official DeepMind project), sparking interest in its origins.

**Key Takeaways**:  
The discussion reflects enthusiasm for iw-SFT’s cost-effectiveness and technical novelty but includes skepticism about its RL framing and benchmark rigor. The community values code accessibility and sees potential in distilling smaller models, though debates around methodology and evaluation persist.

### Playing with Open Source LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://alicegg.tech//2025/07/29/open-source-llm.html) | 73 points | by [zer0tonin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zer0tonin) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44726838)

In a world where AI advancements are rolling in like waves on a beach, our intrepid coder decides to venture out of their comfort zone every six months to explore the latest tools. This time, the buzz was around AI-enhanced command-line tools, specifically tailored for writing code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Entering the spotlight is Claude Code, a tool that promises full autonomy in coding activities, from searching to committing code. However, our reluctant tech enthusiast remains wary of investing in potentially temporary vendor solutions.

To avoid getting trapped in costly or evolving services, they embarked on a journey through the open-source landscape in search of a suitable LLM for coding tasks. They tested various models, including the popular deepseek-r1:8b from China, the French contender mistral:7b, and Alibaba's qwen3:8b. After much trial and error, the qwen3:8b emerged as the favored model due to its balance between accuracy and usability on local setups.

For running these models locally, the coder set up an API using Ollama, a tool likened to Docker but specifically for LLMs, offering an easy way to manage and run these models. With the local API ready, they paired it with 'aider,' a pair programming application designed to work collaboratively with the model. Aider aids in passing context, running linters, and making code changes.

Our explorer then put the setup to the test. In a refactoring task within the Itako project, aider managed to make the instructed changes but ventured outside the task’s scope—a reminder of the tool's current developmental stage. Despite the intrigue, the time investment didn't justify the marginal output improvement for small tasks. For a fresh, greenfield project, however, the coder is keen to see what their new digital assistant can accomplish, leaving endless possibilities and hopefully more productive coding sessions on the horizon.

This adventure reflects the perpetual journey of developers in keeping pace with technological evolution, always weighing the complexities of AI tools against their practical benefits.

However, they remain cost-effective for basic usage or specific applications like text processing.
   - Skepticism persists about whether small models will ever match the performance of larger counterparts, though advances like "mixture of experts" architectures and distillation techniques offer hope.

2. **Open-Source Definitions for AI Models:**
   - Debate erupted over what qualifies an AI model as "open-source." Critics argued that the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has relaxed standards by not requiring training data release, leading to models like Llama being labeled "open" despite opaque training processes.
   - Some users emphasized that true openness requires releasing not just weights and inference code, but also training data, preprocessing scripts, and documentation to enable reproducibility. Others countered that practical constraints (e.g., legal issues with web-scraped data) make full transparency unrealistic.

3. **Local vs. Cloud Trade-offs:**
   - Running models locally saves costs and avoids vendor lock-in but demands significant hardware resources. Users highlighted tools like Ollama for local LLM management, though cost-benefit trade-offs arise when comparing local setups to cloud-based, proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT).

4. **Ethical and Transparency Concerns:**
   - Concerns were raised about "Trojan horse" risks with closed training data, where models might inadvertently include biased or harmful content. Proposals for stricter open-model criteria included licensing guardrails (e.g., O-RAIL) and auditability of training corpora.

5. **Industry Dynamics:**
   - Criticisms targeted tech companies for co-opting "open-source" branding without meeting traditional standards (e.g., Meta’s Llama license restrictions). Calls were made for new frameworks (e.g., "Fair Software") to address gaps between AI models and classic open-source software principles.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a community grappling with the rapid evolution of AI tools, balancing excitement over local, open-source LLMs with frustrations over definitions of openness and skepticism about their current limitations compared to proprietary alternatives.

### Ads are inevitable in AI, and that's okay

#### [Submission URL](https://www.strangeloopcanon.com/p/yes-ads-are-inevitable-in-ai-its) | 5 points | by [FergusArgyll](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FergusArgyll) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44725745)

In a thought-provoking post by Rohit Krishnan, the inevitability and acceptance of ads in AI models are explored as AI technology continues to evolve rapidly. As major players like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini lead the way, the AI model landscape is swiftly becoming more commoditized, with companies like Bytedance and Alibaba trying to keep pace. These AI models are increasingly decreasing in cost yet rising in usage, pushing companies to find new ways to offer unique value and secure their footing in a growing market.

Krishnan suggests that despite the models being interchangeable in functionality, companies can differentiate themselves through innovative product variations and orchestration, as seen with OpenAI's Operator and Codex, and Gemini's appealing Storybook feature. The AI ecosystem may soon resemble SaaS companies in their battle for consumer attention through user experience enhancements.

However, merely offering models at a low price won't suffice for companies longing to join the trillion-dollar realm. The post proposes an obvious yet effective solution—advertising, as seen as a cornerstone business model across various industries. Advertising could serve to optimize pricing models by monetizing AI interactions more effectively, potentially turning AI services into low-margin but high-volume enterprises, echoing the scale and approach of retail giants like Amazon and Costco.

Yet, questions remain about what the future holds for AI models and whether companies will manage to carve out distinct niches or if we'll merely see new layers added to existing technologies. The introduction of ads could provide a robust revenue stream for AI companies and possibly reshape the landscape where AI becomes not just a tool for interaction but also a platform for targeted, intelligent advertising.

The discussion reflects polarized reactions to the idea of integrating ads into AI models. One user critiques ads as "extremely bad" and "terrible," warning of degraded user experiences. Another dismisses the issue as "comparatively small" compared to broader corporate practices, framing ads as inevitable but tolerable. A comment referencing ChatGPT hints at excitement about AI's potential but skepticism about commercialization ("revolutionized machine learning... rethinking concepts"), while others use fragmented or cryptic shorthand. Overall, the conversation captures resistance to ads in AI services, contrasting with the submission’s argument for ads as a pragmatic revenue model. Some users fear intrusive monetization, while others pragmatically accept it as a minor trade-off.

Critics fear this shift could lead to engineers who understand AI-prompting better than they do debugging code.

While Meta's spokesperson highlights the company’s commitment to integrating AI as a daily tool for their engineers, other tech entities remain cautious, maintaining traditional interview practices. As the tech industry grapples with this new era, Meta's move could signal a significant shift towards AI-assisted creativity and efficiency, impacting how software engineers are hired and how they work.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around Meta's AI-enabled coding interviews reveals divided opinions on the implications for tech hiring and engineering skills:

1. **Support for Practical Assessment:**  
   Proponents argue that allowing AI mirrors real-world tasks, where engineers use tools to enhance productivity. Some highlight parallels with schools permitting calculators, emphasizing that understanding problem-solving matters more than manual coding. Others suggest interviews should reflect actual job requirements, focusing on explaining approaches rather than memorization.

2. **Concerns About Skill Erosion:**  
   Critics worry reliance on AI could degrade fundamental coding and debugging abilities. They fear candidates might excel at prompting AI but struggle with critical tasks like optimizing code or explaining technical decisions. Skeptics liken this to "vibecoding"—prioritizing AI-generated output over deep comprehension.

3. **Debate on Leetcode-Style Tests:**  
   Comments note that traditional coding interviews (e.g., LeetCode) already face criticism for favoring memorization over practical skills. Meta’s shift to AI-assisted interviews is seen by some as an extension of flawed metrics, potentially masking true competency, while others view it as a progressive alignment with workplace realities.

4. **Industry Perspectives:**  
   Comparisons are drawn between companies embracing AI (Meta) and those resisting it (Anthropic). Some argue AI use could streamline hiring objectivity, while others highlight legal or trust challenges. A recurring theme is whether AI assessments can reliably measure problem-solving versus mere tool proficiency.

5. **Meta’s Implementation Concerns:**  
   Participants question if Meta’s approach evaluates prompt engineering more than coding skill, risking hires who lack foundational knowledge. Others speculate it might prioritize speed and product output over code quality, reflecting broader Silicon Valley pressures.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion underscores a tension between innovation and tradition in tech hiring. While AI-assisted interviews could modernize evaluations, they also risk undervaluing core engineering skills, raising questions about how to balance tool usage with authentic competency assessment.
