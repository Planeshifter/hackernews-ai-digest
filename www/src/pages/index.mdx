### Getting a Gemini API key is an exercise in frustration

#### [Submission URL](https://ankursethi.com/blog/gemini-api-key-frustration/) | 712 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [281 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46223311)

A developer set out to pay for Gemini 3 Pro to use it as a coding assistant in the terminal—and ran into Google’s product sprawl and enterprise-style billing friction. “Gemini” can mean the consumer chatbot, mobile app, Android voice assistant, Workspace features, CLI, Code Assist, multiple agentic coding tools (Jules, Antigravity), or the underlying LLM—plus non‑Gemini-branded AI products like Vertex AI, AI Studio, and NotebookLM. Unlike OpenAI/Anthropic’s straightforward “Buy Now” flows, there’s no obvious way to just pay for access.

What happened:
- Used the free Gemini chatbot and Claude to figure out that Gemini 3 Pro access requires an API key (via Google AI Studio). Creating the key was easy and worked with Gemini CLI.
- Clicking “Set up billing” booted them into Google Cloud Console’s enterprise flow: create a Billing Account, attach it to a project, add a payment method, pass OTP (India), then undergo extra verification.
- Google then demanded a photo of a government ID and the physical credit card (with numbers manually redacted except the last four) before allowing paid use—an intrusive step that sapped momentum.

Takeaway: For an indie dev trying to quickly buy Gemini 3 Pro for coding, Google’s brand tangle and Cloud-first KYC/billing pipeline turn a simple purchase into a high-friction slog, in stark contrast to the consumer-friendly paths from OpenAI and Anthropic.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

Commenters strongly validated the author's frustration, expanding the criticism from billing friction to technical instability and product confusion. Several developers noted that the Gemini API performs significantly worse than the consumer website, citing frequent timeouts, high latency, and bizarre hallucinations—such as models randomly outputting gibberish or Japanese text. Users described "retry logic" as mandatory when working with Google’s APIs, with some reporting error rates as high as 30% during prototyping.

The "Google Cloud" infrastructure itself was widely panned as hostile to individual developers. Specific complaints included:
*   **Billing Anxiety:** usages reporting takes days to update, meaning "budget caps" might not trigger in time to prevent massive overage charges.
*   **SDK Chaos:** A constant churn of deprecated libraries, confusing naming conventions (Gemini vs. Vertex availability), and documentation that requires third-party AI to decipher.
*   **Enterprise Focus:** Long-time users compared this to the evolution of AdWords, noting that Google has shifted from a self-serve platform for small businesses to a bureaucracy designed solely for large enterprise contracts.

The consensus suggestion was to abstract API calls to support multiple providers (like Mistral or Anthropic), using Google only as a redundant backup rather than a primary dependency.

### Qwen3-Omni-Flash-2025-12-01：a next-generation native multimodal large model

#### [Submission URL](https://qwen.ai/blog?id=qwen3-omni-flash-20251201) | 295 points | by [pretext](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pretext) | [97 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219538)

I’m missing the submission details. Please share the Hacker News link or paste the article (or at least the title and source). If you’d like, tell me:

- Preferred format: 3–5 bullets, 1–2 paragraphs, or a TL;DR + Why it matters
- Include top HN comments? Y/N
- Any angle to emphasize (privacy, dev tooling, business impact, etc.)

Once I have the link or text, I’ll craft an engaging digest with the key takeaways, implications, and any notable caveats.

Based on the discussion provided, here is the digest.

### Qwen Releases "Omni" 30B MoE: Native Speech-to-Speech & Open Weights
**Source:** [HuggingFace / Qwen Team](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-7B) (Context inferred from discussion)

**TL;DR:**
Alibaba’s Qwen team has released a new **30B parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)** model (with only ~3B active parameters) designed for **native speech-to-speech** interaction. Unlike traditional voice assistants that transcribe speech to text, process it, and convert it back to speech (STT $\to$ LLM $\to$ TTS), this model handles audio tokens natively. This architecture ostensibly allows for near-instant latency and the preservation of emotion and intonation, similar to OpenAI’s GPT-4o.

**Why it matters:**
*   **The "Local" Voice Assistant:** Because the active parameter count is low (3B), this is theoretically runnable on consumer hardware, enabling privacy-focused, real-time voice AIs without cloud latency.
*   **Native Audio Understanding:** The inability of standard LLMs to hear tone or distinguish heteronyms (e.g., "record" the verb vs. "record" the noun) is a major bottleneck; native audio models solve this fundamental user experience hurdle.

***

### 🗣️ Top HN Comments & Discussion Key Takeaways

**1. The "Flash" vs. "Instruct" Confusion**
There is significant confusion regarding the benchmarks and naming conventions.
*   **The Caveat:** The discussion highlights that the highly performant "Qwen-Omni-Flash" version seen in benchmarks is likely a **closed-source/API-only** model.
*   The open-weights version available for download is the "Instruct" version. Users feel the branding is slightly deceptive, as the open model does not necessarily match the "Flash" performance metrics that beat larger 235B models.

**2. Verifying "Native" Capabilities**
Users are skeptical but hopeful about whether the model actually "hears" or just transcribes quickly.
*   **The Heteronym Test:** One user tested the model with the words **"record"** (verb) and **"record"** (noun) and confirmed the model handles the pronunciation correctly based on context. This implies true audio processing rather than simple text ingestion.
*   **Prosody:** Users noted that while it handles logic well, achieving the "emotive" or "thinking" pauses seen in demos requires specific prompting or configuration.

**3. Infrastructure is the Bottleneck**
Despite the model being "open," running it is painful.
*   **Tooling Gap:** The model does not yet work out-of-the-box with standard local execution tools like **Ollama** or **Llama.cpp**.
*   **Inference Issues:** Users point out that native audio reasoning requires complex setups (specific branches of vLLM or Python scripts) because the architecture (Audio Encoder + LLM + Audio Decoder) breaks the standard "text-in/text-out" assumption of most current inference engines.
*   **The Build:** A user noted specialized pipelines are required to handle the streaming audio inputs and outputs via WebSockets, making this a "dev-only" toy for now rather than a plug-and-play solution for general users.

### DeepSeek uses banned Nvidia chips for AI model, report says

#### [Submission URL](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-deepseek-uses-banned-nvidia-131207746.html) | 315 points | by [goodway](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goodway) | [308 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46219853)

Bloomberg: DeepSeek allegedly used banned Nvidia chips via gray-market detours

Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has been developing its next model with Nvidia’s Blackwell accelerators despite U.S. export bans, per The Information (via Bloomberg). Sources say the chips were first installed in data centers in countries where sales are allowed, then dismantled and shipped into China after clearing inspection by server makers—an apparent attempt to evade controls. Nvidia said it hasn’t seen substantiation of such a scheme but will pursue any credible tips.

Context:
- U.S. restrictions have pushed Chinese labs to rely on offshore compute or illicit transshipment. In November, U.S. prosecutors charged four people over a Malaysia routing scheme.
- DeepSeek gained attention in January with a low-cost model and is backed by hedge fund High-Flyer, which stockpiled ~10,000 Nvidia GPUs in 2021, pre-ban.
- This week, President Trump allowed Nvidia to ship older H200 accelerators to China; Blackwell remains barred.
- Beijing has urged a pivot to domestic hardware; DeepSeek said its September model involved Chinese chipmakers.

Why it matters: If accurate, the report underscores how hard it is to enforce export controls at the server and logistics layer, the resilience of gray markets, and the stakes for Nvidia and U.S.-China AI decoupling. Expect scrutiny on third-country data centers, server integrators, and customs inspections to tighten.

Based on the discussion, Hacker News users reacted with a mix of cynicism regarding the effectiveness of sanctions, debates on the morality of economic espionage, and broad geopolitical philosophy.

**Key themes in the discussion:**

*   **Lack of Surprise:** Several users noted this was effectively "common knowledge," pointing out that DeepSeek’s Wikipedia entry already mentioned training on Nvidia chips. The consensus was that acquiring hardware through gray markets or "legal means" (via intermediaries) is an expected move for a competitor, with one user calling it "bandits doing a little smuggling."
*   **Morality vs. National Interest:** A significant debate erupted over whether evading sanctions is "morally" wrong or simply a "moral imperative" for a nation to optimize its citizens' economic prospects. Some users argued that sanctions are a form of warfare and that bypassing them is a rational act of self-preservation, likening it to "stealing from a grocery store to feed kids."
*   **Critique of U.S. Policy:** Many commenters viewed the export controls not as security measures but as "protectionism," "corporatism," or a "tax." Users suggested the recent vacillation on allowing specific chip sales points to government corruption or "grift," where the bans merely serve to extract a cut of the proceeds for the state.
*   **Geopolitical Theory:** The conversation shifted into a philosophical debate on "Pax Americana" versus a multi-polar world. Users argued over whether U.S. hegemony has historically reduced violence or if "might makes right" remains the only consistent geopolitical rule, with comparisons drawn to how Western intelligence agencies also operate in legal gray areas.

### New benchmark shows top LLMs struggle in real mental health care

#### [Submission URL](https://swordhealth.com/newsroom/sword-introduces-mindeval) | 112 points | by [RicardoRei](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RicardoRei) | [157 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46217578)

Sword Health open-sources MindEval, an LLM benchmark for mental-health care

- What’s new: Sword Health released MindEval, an open-source framework to evaluate LLMs in realistic, multi-turn “therapy” conversations. It aims to measure clinical competence, not just book knowledge.

- How it works: MindEval stages a simulated session with three agents:
  - Patient LLM: role-plays a consistent patient with a detailed backstory.
  - Clinician LLM: the model under test providing support.
  - Judge LLM: scores the full interaction on five APA-grounded criteria:
    - Clinical Accuracy & Competence
    - Ethical & Professional Conduct
    - Assessment & Response
    - Therapeutic Relationship & Alliance
    - AI-Specific Communication Quality

- Why it matters: Current health AI evals often rely on multiple-choice facts or single-turn “vibe checks,” missing issues like sycophancy, over-reassurance, and poor alliance-building that can be harmful in therapy contexts.

- Validation: The team reports that the simulated patient text more closely matches human role-plays than baseline prompts, and that judge rankings moderately-to-strongly correlate with licensed psychologists (e.g., Kendall’s Tau, MIPSA), within human inter-rater ranges.

- Open-source: Prompts, code, and datasets are being released with the goal of a community standard for mental-health model safety and effectiveness.

- Likely HN questions:
  - Can a model-judge be gamed, and how robust is it across model families?
  - How well do results transfer from simulated patients to real humans and crisis scenarios?
  - Coverage of demographics, conditions, and cultural contexts?
  - Transparency of rubrics, rater instructions, and reproducibility of the validation?
  - Alignment with regulatory expectations for clinical-grade AI.

Bottom line: A timely push to move mental-health LLM evaluation from static knowledge checks to dynamic, clinically grounded assessments. If the open-source community validates and extends it, MindEval could become a useful yardstick—provided it resists overfitting to its own judge and proves out on real-world data.

Based on the discussion, the community engaged with the author (**RicardoRei**) on the methodology of the benchmark and the interpretation of the results. The conversation centered on three main themes:

**The Lack of Human Baselines**
The most rigorous debate concerned the lack of a control group. Users **megaman821** and **crzygrng** argued that claiming models "struggle" (scoring <4/16) is meaningless without knowing how a real human therapist would score on the same rubric.
*   critics suggested using services like BetterHelp to establish a valid human baseline, arguing that the title "Top models struggle" is subjective if humans might effectively score the same.
*   **RicardoRei** defended the approach, stating the goal is to validate patient realism and measure AI safety/improvement rather than prove AI is "better" than humans yet.
*   **plmt** supported the findings by noting a key differentiator: the benchmark shows model performance degrades significantly in long conversations (40+ turns), whereas human therapists typically do not get worse as a session lengthens.

**Prompting Methodology**
**mbddng-shp** challenged the decision to use a fixed prompt for all models. They argued that "one prompt to rule them all" causes high variance and doesn't measure a model's true capability, as different models (e.g., Llama vs. GPT) require specific system prompt tuning to produce high-quality outputs. The author maintained that keeping prompts consistent was necessary for a fair, scientific comparison of the models "out of the box."

**Clinical Approaches**
There was a tangential discussion regarding structured therapy data. **jbgt** mentioned existing structured methods like David Burns’ *Feeling Great* (TEAM-CBT). This sparked a debate—led by **trth** and **kydlycn**—about the efficacy of CBT, with some users criticizing it as an insurance-friendly "cure-all" that ignores cognitive nuances, while others noted that human therapists often fail to follow structured methods irrespective of efficacy.

### McDonald's pulls AI Christmas ad after backlash

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czdgrnvp082o) | 114 points | by [mindracer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindracer) | [156 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46217176)

McDonald’s Netherlands pulls AI-generated Christmas ad after backlash

- What happened: A 45-second Christmas spot made from stitched generative-AI clips, created by TBWA\Neboko and US production company The Sweetshop, went live on Dec 6 and was pulled on Dec 9 after viewers slammed its uncanny characters, choppy edits, and “creepy” vibe. McDonald’s Netherlands called it an “important learning” as it explores AI’s “effective use.”
- Defense from the makers: The Sweetshop’s CEO said the team spent seven weeks, produced “thousands of takes,” and edited as they would a high-craft production, arguing “This wasn’t an AI trick. It was a film.”
- Context: Generative video tends to degrade over longer durations, so longer ads often rely on many short stitched clips—amplifying continuity issues. Despite growing brand interest (e.g., Coca-Cola’s AI holiday work earning majority-positive sentiment per one analytics firm), AI-led ads keep provoking “cheap/lazy” critiques and job-displacement worries; Valentino’s recent AI campaign drew similar fire.
- Why it matters: 
  - Highlights the gap between rapid, low-cost AI production and brand-safe creative quality for 30–60s spots.
  - Shows current gen-AI video limits (coherence, anatomy, continuity) can quickly become a reputational risk at scale.
  - Underscores brewing labor tensions as brands test AI in traditionally human-heavy workflows.
  - Signals that AI can win when execution aligns with audience expectations—but misfires are public and swift.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**The Irony of "Labor-Saving" Effort**
Commenters seized on The Sweetshop’s defensive statement that their team "hardly slept" and produced thousands of takes over seven weeks. Users pointed out the irony of a production company named "The Sweetshop" describing conditions that sounded like a "sweatshop." There was widespread confusion as to why a technology marketed as labor-saving resulted in grueling crunch time for a product that users felt looked "cheap" and "inferior."

**Quality vs. The "Slot Machine" Method**
Critics did the math on the production timeline (7 weeks x 10 people), arguing that a team of animators could have hand-drawn a far superior 45-second commercial in the same amount of time. The AI workflow was described not as filmmaking, but as pulling the handle on a "slot machine" repeatedly until a usable clip accidentally emerged. One user argued that generative video fundamentally lacks a "world model," resulting in a "nightmarish wrongness" regarding physics and anatomy that may never fully resolve.

**Stone Tools and Capitalism**
A significant philosophical debate emerged regarding technological progress. While some users equated AI to prehistoric humans inventing stone tools to reduce effort, others pushed back on the analogy. They argued that while stone tools directly benefited the user, AI under modern capitalism disrupts this relationship by benefiting the asset owner while displacing the worker. This led to a broader discussion on whether tech leaders are "shoving" inferior technology (like early, hallucinating LLMs) down the public's throat before the legal and quality issues are solved.

**Historical Tangents**
The argument about "labor-saving technology" derailed into a dark, sarcastic sub-thread comparing AI to the Atomic Bomb (as a technology designed to "save labor" in war), leading to a dispute over historical casualty statistics and World War II surrender terms.

### AI chatbots can sway voters with remarkable ease

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03975-9#ref-CR1) | 34 points | by [marojejian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marojejian) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46223522)

Nature/Science: Chatbots can measurably shift voter preferences — and the more “informative” they get, the more they hallucinate. Across nearly 6,000 participants in the US, Canada, and Poland, brief back-and-forths with a candidate-advocating chatbot moved ratings by 2–4 points in the US (Trump–Harris context) and about 10 points in Canada/Poland, with swings up to 15 points in some cases—far larger than the sub‑1‑point shifts typical of political ads. Bots were most persuasive when making policy-focused, evidence-heavy arguments; when prevented from presenting facts, persuasion collapsed by 78% (Poland). However, more information also increased false statements, and models advocating right-leaning candidates produced more inaccuracies than those supporting left-leaning ones—likely reflecting patterns in online content. Authors say the edge comes from chatbots’ ability to synthesize lots of information conversationally, highlighting risks for election manipulation at scale. Caveat: these are short-term opinion ratings, not observed votes, and US effects were smaller amid high polarization.

**The Effective, Hallucinating Campaign Manager**

Check out this submission about a new study published in *Nature* and *Science*, suggesting that chatbots are surprisingly effective at changing minds in the voting booth—or at least in opinion polls.

**The Story:**
Researchers studied nearly 6,000 participants across the US, Canada, and Poland to see if large language models (LLMs) could shift political views. The results showed that brief conversations with a chatbot advocating for a specific candidate shifted ratings by 2–4 points in the highly polarized US, and up to 10–15 points in Canada and Poland. These numbers dwarf the sub-1-point shifts usually attributed to traditional political ads.

The study found a specific mechanism for this success: chatbots were most persuasive when they used evidence-heavy, policy-focused arguments. When the bots were restricted from using data, their persuasion dropped significantly. However, there is a catch: as the bots became more "informative," they also hallucinated more frequently. Furthermore, models arguing for right-leaning candidates tended to produce more falsehoods than those arguing for left-leaning ones. The authors warn that the ability of AI to synthesize vast amounts of information conversationally poses a risk for large-scale election manipulation, though they note that these opinion shifts were short-term and measured via ratings rather than actual observed votes.

** The Discussion:**
The Hacker News comments generally accepted the premise but debated the *why* and the *how much*, oscillating between optimism about rational discourse and fear of hyper-personalized propaganda.

*   **The "Face-Saving" Theory:** Users theorized that chatbots are effective because they remove the social cost of being wrong. One commenter noted that changing your mind in a human debate involves losing social standing ("losing face"), whereas a machine doesn't trigger that defensive, tribal response. It allows for a more Socratic, "intellectual journey" rather than a confrontation.
*   **Skepticism on Magnitude:** Several users pushed back on the reported impact size. A detailed critique argued that the study likely suffers from the Hawthorne effect (participants telling researchers what they want to hear) and criticized the gap between low-stakes survey responses and actual voting behavior. They doubted that a six-minute chat could truly override years of cynicism or emotional connection to a candidate when the real ballot is cast.
*   **Hyper-Personalized Propaganda:** The conversation took a darker turn regarding the potential for misuse. One user described a scenario where, instead of generic Fox News chyrons, LLMs could scrape a user's Google profile to generate terrifyingly specific narratives—e.g., telling a plumber in Nashville that low-wage immigrants are specifically targeting their local trade—to maximize fear and engagement.
*   **The Translation Gap:** There was noticeable friction regarding how LLMs handle political ideology. While some felt LLMs could bridge the gap between liberals and conservatives (who often "speak different languages" regarding values), others found current models dismissive of conservative logic, often framing counter-arguments as factually incorrect rather than valuing the philosophical difference.

The thread concluded with an unsettling comparison to the game *Universal Paperclips*, where "hypnodrones" are used to manipulate populations—a sci-fi mechanic that suddenly feels much closer to reality.

## AI Submissions for Tue Dec 09 2025 {{ 'date': '2025-12-09T17:14:16.088Z' }}

### Mistral releases Devstral2 and Mistral Vibe CLI

#### [Submission URL](https://mistral.ai/news/devstral-2-vibe-cli) | 697 points | by [pember](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pember) | [321 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205437)

Devstral 2 launches: open-weight code models + native CLI for autonomous coding

- What’s new
  - Devstral 2 (123B, 256K context) and Devstral Small 2 (24B, 256K) are out as open-weight coding models for code agents.
  - Licenses: Devstral 2 under a modified MIT; Devstral Small 2 under Apache 2.0.
  - Mistral Vibe CLI: an open-source, terminal-native agent that edits, runs, and orchestrates multi-file changes in your repo.

- Performance and positioning
  - SWE-bench Verified: 72.2% (Devstral 2), 68.0% (Small 2).
  - Claims up to 7x cost-efficiency vs Claude Sonnet on real tasks.
  - Human evals: beats DeepSeek V3.2 (42.8% win vs 28.6% loss); Claude Sonnet 4.5 still preferred overall.
  - Model size comparisons: 5x/28x smaller than DeepSeek V3.2 and 8x/41x smaller than Kimi K2 (123B/24B respectively).

- Capabilities aimed at agents
  - Maintains architecture-level context, tracks framework deps, retries with corrections.
  - Multi-file planning and edits, codebase exploration, bug fixes, and modernization workflows.
  - Fine-tunable for language/domain preferences; Small 2 also supports image inputs for multimodal agents.

- Vibe CLI highlights
  - Project-aware context (auto-scans repo, Git status), smart references (@ files, ! shell), slash-command config.
  - Tooling for file ops, search, VCS, command execution; persistent history and autocompletion.
  - Works in terminal and via Agent Communication Protocol; Zed IDE extension available.

- Availability and pricing
  - API free for now; afterward: Devstral 2 at $0.40 in / $2.00 out per million tokens; Small 2 at $0.10 in / $0.30 out.
  - Partners: integrations with Kilo Code and Cline.

- Deployment
  - Devstral 2: optimized for data centers; needs at least 4× H100-class GPUs; try on build.nvidia.com.
  - Devstral Small 2: single-GPU and CPU-only capable; runs across NVIDIA systems, including consumer GeForce RTX. NIM support “soon.”
  - On-prem and custom fine-tuning supported; suggested decoding temperature 0.2.

- Why it matters
  - Pushes open-weight coding agents closer to closed-model performance while being much smaller and cheaper to run.
  - The modified MIT license for the 123B model may draw scrutiny, but Apache 2.0 on the 24B model plus local/CPU options lower barriers for teams and hobbyists.
  - Native CLI agent and IDE integration emphasize practical, workflow-level automation over pure benchmarks.

Based on the discussion provided, here is the summary:

**The "Pelican Riding a Bicycle" Benchmark**
Much of the discussion focuses on user *smnw* (Simon Willison) testing the 123B model with a specific prompt: generating an SVG of a pelican riding a bicycle. Willison notes that while the prompt started as a "stupid joke," success correlates "spookily" well with a model’s general quality and "vibes." Users debated the validity of this test:
*   **Critics** argued that because the prompt is now popular, it is likely included in training data ("benchmaxxing"), making it a poor metric for genuine intelligence due to Goodhart’s Law.
*   **Defenders** noted that the task is not merely "drawing," but demonstrating knowledge of SVG coding specifications, spatial reasoning, and world understanding. The challenge lies in creatively combining concepts (pelicans and bicycles) that are physically incompatible in the real world.

**Theoretical Debates: "The Wine Glass" Problem**
Participants drew parallels to the "wine glass" problem (a test of physical reasoning constraints). There was a debate regarding whether the pelican prompt constitutes a "realistic" or "unrealistic" scenario. Some argued that because pelicans *cannot* ride bikes, it tests the model's ability to handle impossible constraints creatively, while others argued it simply mimics logic found in children's animation (e.g., *The Adventures of Paddy the Pelican*).

**Alternative Evaluations**
The thread evolved into a broader discussion on how to evaluate coding models beyond standard benchmarks:
*   **Coding Environments:** Some users argued that models need an environment to run code (e.g., a Python sandbox) to verify logic rather than guessing token probabilities, particularly for math or string manipulation.
*   **Historical Recreation:** One user suggested asking models to recreate the 1996 *Space Jam* website. While some felt this relied on obsolete standards (HTML tables/framesets), others argued it effectively tests a model’s ability to generalize and utilize historical technical specifications compared to keeping up with modern standards like SVG.

### Donating the Model Context Protocol and establishing the Agentic AI Foundation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/donating-the-model-context-protocol-and-establishing-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation) | 274 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46207425)

Anthropic donates Model Context Protocol to new Linux Foundation fund for “agentic AI”

- What’s new: Anthropic is donating the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open standard for connecting AI agents to tools, data, and systems—to the Linux Foundation’s newly created Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF). AAIF is a directed fund co-founded by Anthropic, Block, and OpenAI, with support from Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg. MCP joins Block’s goose and OpenAI’s AGENTS.md as founding projects. Governance stays community-led and vendor-neutral.

- By the numbers: 
  - 10,000+ active public MCP servers (from dev tools to Fortune 500 deployments)
  - Adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, VS Code, and more
  - Enterprise deployment support from AWS, Cloudflare, Google Cloud, Azure
  - 97M+ monthly SDK downloads across Python and TypeScript
  - 75+ MCP-powered connectors listed in Claude’s directory

- Recent MCP upgrades:
  - Official community Registry for discovering servers
  - Nov 25 spec: async operations, statelessness, server identity, official extensions
  - Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling in Anthropic’s API to scale to thousands of tools and reduce latency in complex agent workflows

- Why it matters:
  - Signals industry consolidation around a neutral, open standard for tool/use and system integration—key to making agents interoperable across IDEs, models, and clouds
  - Linux Foundation stewardship (think Kubernetes, PyTorch) is likely to reassure enterprises on neutrality, longevity, and security
  - Could reduce fragmentation and vendor lock-in while speeding up production deployments of agentic systems

- What to watch:
  - How AAIF coordinates specs and compatibility across goose, AGENTS.md, and MCP
  - Security hardening around server identity and permissioning as MCP usage scales
  - Whether big-platform adoption (Copilot, ChatGPT, Gemini) translates into standardized plugin/connector ecosystems

Note: The post also links to related partner news (Accenture, Snowflake) and a claim about acquiring Bun tied to Claude Code—framed as separate announcements.

Here is a summary of the Hacker News discussion:

**Skepticism on "Donations" and Comparisons to Kubernetes**
The discussion opened with significant cynicism regarding the nature of the donation. User `jpmcb` argued that foundations like the Linux Foundation (LF) function as revenue pipelines (referencing KubeCon) and questioned if MCP is mature enough or generates the necessary revenue streams to warrant this level of stewardship compared to established projects like Kubernetes. While `Eldodi` noted that MCP adoption is moving much faster than Kubernetes did, others, like `bq`, felt that comparing a protocol for connecting tools (often just "shell scripts") to the backbone of cloud infrastructure was a stretch. However, `anon84873628` defended the move, arguing that LF stewardship is crucial for assuring enterprises of vendor neutrality.

**Technical Debate: MCP vs. OpenAPI/REST**
A major portion of the thread focused on why MCP is necessary when REST APIs and OpenAPI (Swagger) specs already exist.
*   **The Skeptics:** User `yard2010` and others asked why an LLM can't simply read an OpenAPI spec and call the endpoints directly, suggesting that wrapping APIs in MCP layers feels like "overkill" or unnecessary "gatekeeping."
*   **The Proponents:** `mrds` and `anon84873628` countered that raw API endpoints are often too granular and noisy for LLM context windows. They argued that 90% of a standard API output is irrelevant to an agent; MCP acts as a "high signal" abstraction layer that provides security, cleaner context, and curated business logic rather than raw data dumps.

**The "AI Should Just Fix It" Argument**
Several users questioned the philosophy of creating rigid protocols for AI agents. `nbtlr` and `ModernMech` suggested that "true" AI should be able to dynamically write code to interface with tools or interpret documentation without a standardized middleman. They viewed MCP as a regression to traditional engineering practices rather than an evolution of AI capabilities. `jascha_eng` stated they build LLM tools daily without MCP, viewing it as a solution to a very specific problem—bringing own tools to an existing chatbot—rather than a fundamental necessity for AI development.

**The "Killer App" Consensus**
Despite the skepticism, `mxwllg` and others identified the specific utility that drives MCP's value: it solves the fragmentation problem for users wanting to bring their own local tools (like internal databases or JIRA) into hosted, generalized chatbots (like Claude or ChatGPT). While it might be an abstraction layer some developers dislike, it standardizes the interface so vendors don't have to build custom integrations for every model.

### Apple's slow AI pace becomes a strength as market grows weary of spending

#### [Submission URL](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-slow-ai-pace-becomes-104658095.html) | 335 points | by [bgwalter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bgwalter) | [402 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205724)

Apple’s “slow AI” strategy is suddenly a feature, not a bug. After lagging badly in H1 2025 (down 18% through June), Apple has ripped 35% since, outpacing AI high-fliers like Meta and Microsoft as investors grow wary of massive AI capex. The market is rewarding restraint: Apple now sits around a $4.1T market cap, the second-biggest weight in the S&P 500, leapfrogging Microsoft and closing in on Nvidia.

Why it matters
- Rotation to discipline: With Big Tech pouring hundreds of billions into AI, Apple’s measured approach—and its position as the likely distribution layer (iPhone + services) when AI goes mainstream—looks safer to investors.
- Valuation risk: Shares trade at ~33x next-12-month earnings vs a 15-year average under 19x, making Apple the second-priciest name in the “Magnificent Seven” after Tesla. Some on Wall Street warn the premium may be overpaying for defensiveness.
- Mixed signals: Berkshire trimmed its Apple stake by ~15% in Q3 (while adding Alphabet), and technicians flag near-term overextension vs the 200-day average, even as the long-term trend remains bullish.

The big picture
- Apple avoided the AI arms race and its capex burn, yet stands to benefit as AI usage flows through its devices and high-margin services.
- The tradeoff: a richer multiple that raises the bar for future compounding.

Also in the piece
- Nvidia gets a green light to ship H200 AI chips to China with a 25% surcharge, potentially restoring a major revenue stream.
- Paramount Skydance launches a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery at $30/share cash, valuing WBD at ~$108B including debt.
- Reddit rolls out global safety features for under-18s ahead of Australia’s social-media curbs.
- India’s quick-commerce sector heads for consolidation; Microsoft’s Satya Nadella visits India as a proving ground for AI.
- No major earnings due Tuesday.

**The Economics of Voice Assistants:**
*   Commenters contrast Apple's strategy with the "colossal failure" of Amazon Alexa, which reportedly lost $10B/year. Users note that while Alexa handled billions of interactions, most were non-monetizable utilities (timers, weather) that incurred high server costs.
*   Apple’s on-device approach is viewed as economically superior: by running inference locally on the Neural Engine, the marginal cost to Apple is near zero, avoiding the massive data center burn that plagued competitors.

**The "Dumber" Smart Home:**
*   A significant portion of the discussion focuses on the degradation of existing assistants (Google Assistant, Alexa) over the last few years. Users report that simple tasks—like turning off lights or navigating home—have become unreliable.
*   There is skepticism regarding the integration of LLMs into these workflows; some fear that replacing hard-coded logic with probabilistic models will result in "brain-damaged robots" that struggle with simple, binary hardware commands.

**Apple’s Identity: Hardware vs. Services:**
*   A debate emerged regarding Apple's true business model. Some argue the company is strictly a hardware vendor using services (iCloud, Apple Music) solely to increase ecosystem stickiness and device sales.
*   Counter-arguments point to the Financials: with Services boasting ~75% profit margins (compared to ~40% for hardware) and generating revenue comparable to Fortune 50 companies, many argue Apple has successfully transitioned into a services juggernaut, regardless of the role hardware plays as the growing medium.

### Agentic AI Foundation

#### [Submission URL](https://block.xyz/inside/block-anthropic-and-openai-launch-the-agentic-ai-foundation) | 116 points | by [thinkingkong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thinkingkong) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46209846)

Agentic AI gets its own Linux Foundation home

What’s new
- Block, Anthropic, OpenAI and others are forming the Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) under the Linux Foundation to standardize and fund open, interoperable “agent” tech—systems that take initiative and act with minimal human direction.
- Initial open contributions:
  - Block’s goose: an open agent framework (now moving to community governance) and a reference implementation of Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol.
  - Anthropic’s Model Context Protocol (MCP): an open protocol for agents to tap external tools/data in a standardized way.
  - OpenAI’s AGENTS.md: a convention for giving coding agents project-specific instructions; reportedly used by 20k+ OSS projects.

Who’s backing it
- Founders: Block, Anthropic, OpenAI.
- Platinum members: AWS, Bloomberg, Cloudflare, Google, Microsoft.
- Gold/Silver include Cisco, Docker, IBM, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Shopify, Snowflake, Twilio, Hugging Face, Uber, Zapier, and more.

Why it matters
- The pitch: avoid a fragmented, proprietary agent ecosystem by rallying around open protocols, reference implementations, and neutral governance—akin to how the Internet, Linux, and the Web scaled.
- The ambition: become a W3C-like forum for agent standards so tools, models, and runtimes interoperate and vendors can compete without lock‑in.

How it’ll work
- Linux Foundation-style open governance; emphasis on sustainability and neutrality.
- Scope is narrowly focused on agentic AI (not all of ML/AI).
- Projects included based on adoption, quality, and community health; more candidates are under evaluation.

What to watch
- Will MCP/AGENTS.md/goose emerge as de facto building blocks across frameworks and model providers?
- How “vendor-neutral” the foundation remains with hyperscalers at the table.
- Clarity on IP policies, security/sandboxing guidance for agents, and overlap with existing standards (e.g., OpenAPI, OAuth) and frameworks.

Bottom line
A heavyweight coalition is trying to make agentic AI interoperable by default. If AAIF lands credible, widely adopted standards and neutral governance, it could do for agents what W3C did for the web. If not, expect continued fragmentation and vendor-specific ecosystems.

Here is a summary of the Hacker News discussion regarding the Agentic AI Foundation:

**Critique of Block’s "Goose"**
The majority of technical discussion focused on Block’s contribution, the "Goose" framework. Users who had previously tested it described the experience negatively, calling it "junk" or "crappy," particularly criticizing its UI and past model performance.
*   **Alternatives:** Commenters suggested several preferred alternatives for agentic coding, including **OpenHands** (noting its v1 improvements), **Claude Code**, **OpenCode**, and VS Code extensions like **Roo Code** or **Kilo**.
*   **Skepticism:** Some users remain generally skeptical of current agentic tools, finding them buggy or confusing to troubleshoot when the model goes off-track.

**Confusion over Block & Crypto Branding**
A significant portion of the thread expressed confusion or amusement regarding Block’s (formerly Square) involvement and branding.
*   **Marketing Fluff:** Users mocked the copy on Block’s website—specifically claims describing Bitcoin as "fast" and "low-cost"—with some describing the site as feeling like a "parody company" or "grift adjacent."
*   **Identity Crisis:** Commenters noted the disconnect between the company's real business (POS terminals/credit card processing) and its "Web5"/crypto marketing persona.

**Governance & Design Snark**
*   **The Irony:** One user pointed out the irony of Anthropic co-founding an open-source foundation while maintaining a closed-source desktop CLI for their own products.
*   **Visuals:** The foundation's website design drew comparisons to the early 2000s "Million Dollar Homepage," reinforcing the "grift-adjacent" feeling for some observers.

### OpenEvolve: Teaching LLMs to Discover Algorithms Through Evolution

#### [Submission URL](https://algorithmicsuperintelligence.ai/blog/openevolve-overview/index.html) | 48 points | by [codelion](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codelion) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46211861)

OpenEvolve: an open-source evolutionary coding agent that uses LLMs to discover and optimize algorithms by combining quality–diversity search (MAP-Elites) with an island-model GA and a pragmatic eval loop.

Why it matters
- Moves beyond hand-tuned heuristics and gradient search by letting LLMs propose code edits inside an evolutionary framework.
- Aims for both performance and diversity, helping surface genuinely different algorithmic ideas rather than converging on one local optimum.
- Early reports show large speedups on the AlgoTune benchmark and successful applications in systems and scientific domains.

How it works
- LLM-guided edits: Prompts include a “parent” program plus curated evidence (top performers, lineage, diverse extremes, random picks). Models produce either diff-based SEARCH/REPLACE edits by default or full rewrites.
- Quality–diversity via MAP-Elites: Each island bins candidates along feature axes (defaults: complexity, structural diversity; you can add your own). One elite per cell, replaced only by higher fitness.
- Islands with lazy migration: Multiple isolated populations evolve in parallel; migration is triggered by per-island progress (not wall time) and avoids duplicates. Ring topology by default.
- Cascade evaluation: Optional multi-stage tests (fast checks → lightweight tests → full benchmarks) with thresholds to cheaply filter weak candidates; timeouts, stderr, and tracebacks are captured as artifacts.
- Artifact side-channel: Execution traces and errors feed back into future prompts; optional LLM-based feedback can be folded into scoring.
- Model ensemble: Weighted sampling over OpenAI-compatible models; deterministic under seeds. Islands can be pinned to specific models.
- Controller + DB: Parallel execution, checkpoints/resume, population limits, global best tracking, prompt logs, and artifact storage.

Notable use cases
- Systems and GPU kernel optimization
- Scientific discovery and geospatial algorithms
- Scaling-law discovery
- Prompt/program optimization

Why it’s different
- Explicit quality–diversity (MAP-Elites) to preserve variety, not just best fitness.
- Structural diversity (e.g., edit distance) instead of embeddings to detect duplicates and promote novelty.
- Double-selection prompt strategy: pick strong parents but mix in diverse exemplars to guide exploration without direct code recombination.

Practical notes / caveats
- Results depend on your evaluation harness; sandboxing and resource limits matter for safe execution.
- Compute cost can be significant; cascade staging and parallelism help.
- Reproducible runs via seeds and checkpointing; still subject to model nondeterminism if not fully controlled.

Bottom line: A well-engineered framework for turning LLMs into evolutionary code searchers—useful if you want to systematically explore algorithmic space with strong tooling for diversity, feedback, and parallelism.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion focused on the project's lineage, technical clarity, and comparative performance:

*   **AlphaEvolve Connection:** Users recognized the architecture as being heavily inspired by AlphaEvolve. The maintainer confirmed that OpenEvolve is intended to be an open-source implementation of the AlphaEvolve paper, as the original code has not been released.
*   **Mechanism Clarification:** There was confusion regarding whether the system improves by updating LLM weights. Participants clarified that since the system uses hosted models, only the prompts and the code itself evolve, not the model weights.
*   **Performance & Insight:** Commenters praised the use of MAP-Elites and island models for preventing premature convergence. One user highlighted a specific "meta-level insight" where the system successfully discovered a completely new algorithmic paradigm (using `scipy.optimize.SLSQP` for circle packing) rather than just performing parameter tuning.
*   **Related Work:** Users compared the project to SakanaAI’s ShinkaEvolve, noting it as another relevant open-source evolutionary framework.

### Show HN: I got tired of switching AI tools, so I built an IDE with 11 of them

#### [Submission URL](https://hivetechs.io) | 17 points | by [hivetechs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hivetechs) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46205493)

HiveTechs Consensus: multi-model “debate” and a unified IDE to trust AI output

- What it is: A macOS IDE and terminal workspace that runs 11 AI tools side‑by‑side (Claude, Gemini, Grok, Copilot CLI, Cursor CLI, DeepSeek, Qwen Code, etc.) and orchestrates a 3‑model, round‑based “consensus” process to cross‑validate answers. It stores verified outputs in a searchable “Consensus Memory.”

- Why it matters: No single model is consistently best; HiveTechs tries to reduce hallucinations and pick the right model per task by pitting models against each other, validating results, and reusing vetted answers.

- How it works:
  - Multi‑Model Consensus: Three models debate in rounds until they converge on an answer.
  - Benchmark‑Driven Profiles: Model selection guided by nine external benchmarks.
  - Consensus Memory: Query previous cross‑verified results for repeatable answers.
  - Integrated Terminals + IDE: Code, debug, and manage AI workflows in one place; one‑click launch and updates.
  - OpenRouter integration: Access 340+ models from 50+ providers with usage‑based pricing; automatic cost optimization, real‑time monitoring, exports.

- Getting started: Create an OpenRouter account, generate an API key, install HiveTechs (Homebrew), and connect your key in the setup wizard.

- Pricing (14‑day unlimited free trial on paid tiers):
  - Free: $0 — 1 concurrent tool, 5 daily consensus conversations, 1 device.
  - Standard: $10/mo — 2 tools, 20 daily consensus conversations, 2 devices.
  - Pro: $20/mo — 5 tools, 50 daily consensus conversations, 3 devices.
  - Max (most popular): $30/mo — all 11 tools simultaneously, unlimited conversations, 5 devices.
  - Team: $120/mo — all 11 tools × 5 developers, unlimited conversations, 5 devices each (≈20% savings vs 5 Max plans).
  - All plans include multi‑model consensus, IDE/terminal integrations, long‑term memory, OpenRouter access, cost optimization, and monitoring.

- Caveats/notes:
  - macOS only (per the download callout).
  - Requires OpenRouter and API key; costs follow usage of underlying models.
  - Privacy and offline behavior are raised in the FAQ, but details aren’t in the excerpt.

Bottom line: HiveTechs pitches a “trust layer” for AI development—run many models at once, force them to agree, and reuse validated outputs—wrapped in a single macOS IDE/CLI with granular cost control.

**Discussion Summary:**

The conversation focused on the technical architecture of the IDE and the logistics of using OpenRouter as the backend aggregator.

*   **OpenRouter & Billing:** Users asked about the advantages of OpenRouter, specifically regarding billing consolidation. Others clarified that it centralizes payments for various models at prices generally matching direct providers (with minor variances based on payment methods). The value of prompt caching was highlighted for cost savings, which the creator confirmed HiveTechs supports.
*   **Architecture (VS Code Fork?):** A user asked if the IDE was a fork of VS Code and if it supported existing extensions. The creator clarified that HiveTechs is built from scratch using Electron and the Monaco Editor (the operational core of VS Code) but is not a fork; it utilizes a custom backend stack (Node.js, SQLite, Cloudflare D1) to support its specific features but does not inherently support standard VS Code extensions.
*   **The "Consensus" Utility:** Users joked that models debating resembled old antivirus software fighting itself, but the creator argued for the practical utility of the feature. They noted that specific models currently excel at different niches (e.g., Gemini for frontend, Claude for backend), making a unified interface for cross-model querying effective for reducing development time.

### Google is powering a new US Military AI platform

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/news/841219/google-gemini-us-military-ai-platform-genai-mil) | 33 points | by [kevin061](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kevin061) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46212202)

Google’s Gemini is the first model on the Pentagon’s new GenAI.mil platform, a “bespoke” AI portal the Department of Defense says will eventually host multiple models. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth pitched it in martial terms (“the future of American warfare is … AI”), while Google emphasized lower-stakes workflows: summarizing policy handbooks, generating compliance checklists, extracting key terms from statements of work, and building risk assessments. DoD says it’s for unclassified work only, and Google says data won’t train its public models.

- Context: Google has prior DoD AI history (Project Maven) and this year reversed a pledge to avoid AI for weapons/surveillance.
- Rollout hiccups: At least one Army user reported an unexpected “Gen AI” pop-up on a work machine; the genai.mil site blocks non-DoD networks.
- Roadmap: Pentagon CTO Emil Michael said more models are coming (per DefenseScoop).

Why it matters: The U.S. military is formalizing a multi-model AI stack with cloud vendors, signaling fresh demand — and renewed ethical scrutiny — for Big Tech’s defense work, even as initial uses skew toward paperwork and planning.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**Model Convergence and Ecosystems**
Much of the discussion veered away from the military context to the broader AI landscape. Commenters argued that while major LLMs are converging in quality, Google possesses a distinct advantage through integration with Android and Search—something Apple and Amazon (Alexa) currently lack. This sparked a side debate regarding xAI’s Grok; while some users praised its surprisingly high performance in coding and reasoning benchmarks, others remained skeptical, citing the chatbot's reputation for ridiculous responses.

**Bureaucracy vs. Lethality**
Users predicted that despite the "future of warfare" marketing, the practical application of Gemini in the military will be mundane: writing counselings, drafting award speeches, and querying regulations. This reality was contrasted with the Defense Secretary’s intense rhetoric; one commenter mocked the promise of bringing "lethal" force to the "American warrior" by juxtaposing it with the current absurdity of AI-generated content (referencing "Shrimp Jesus" memes).

**Ethical Concerns and "Skynet"**
The thread included standard apprehensions regarding military AI, ranging from concise "Skynet" references to more detailed concerns about a "slippery slope." Users worried that lucrative defense contracts would inevitably push tech giants from providing administrative assistance to developing autonomous weaponry or "killbots."

### OpenAI Is in Trouble

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/2025/12/openai-losing-ai-wars/685201/) | 24 points | by [ent101](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ent101) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46211994)

Google’s Gemini 3 rattles OpenAI’s lead, sparks “code red”

- Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, a longtime ChatGPT user, publicly switched to Google’s Gemini 3, calling its leap “insane.” Industry voices have echoed that sentiment, with Google touting benchmark wins and some analysts labeling Gemini 3 the new frontrunner.
- OpenAI reportedly issued a “code red” memo to boost ChatGPT. The company’s once-clear edge has blurred: Google’s newer image-generation tech is drawing users, Gemini’s growth appears to be outpacing ChatGPT’s, Anthropic’s Claude is widely seen as best-in-class for coding, and Elon Musk’s Grok is near parity with ChatGPT.
- OpenAI has rebounded before—by launching “reasoning” models and a cheaper, efficient model after DeepSeek’s rise. Its research chief says internal systems on par with Gemini 3 are coming soon.
- While rivals race on capability, OpenAI has pushed a broader product strategy: shopping features, a browser, a social-style app, and group chats—moves that build an OpenAI-centric ecosystem. Altman’s memo reportedly says some commercial projects will be deprioritized to focus on core model quality.
- A New York Times investigation says engagement tuning may have made some ChatGPT versions overly agreeable, with lawsuits alleging harmful reinforcement; OpenAI denies the claims in the first suit and is reviewing newer ones.
- Strategic backdrop: Google can instantly weave Gemini into products with billions of users (Search, Android, Workspace), while OpenAI has yet to hit a billion users on any single product—underscoring its startup disadvantage in distribution.

Why it matters
- The frontier fight is shifting from pure model prowess to speed of integration, user growth, developer adoption, and cost/latency. Google’s distribution could cement default AI habits faster than OpenAI can counter—unless OpenAI’s next releases meaningfully close the gap.

What to watch
- OpenAI’s upcoming models and whether they match or beat Gemini 3 in real-world tasks (coding, multimodal reasoning, latency, cost).
- How aggressively Google infuses Gemini into Search and Android, and any regulatory scrutiny that follows.
- Whether OpenAI scales back product sprawl to double down on core research—and if that reins in engagement risks.

Source: The Atlantic (Matteo Wong)

**The Discussion**

*   **OpenAI’s Stability and Leadership:** A segment of the discussion focused on Sam Altman’s recent comment describing his role as potentially the "most important job in history." Critics viewed this as a lack of self-awareness, with one user suggesting there is a 50/50 chance OpenAI ends up resembling a bubble burst (Pets.com) or a fraud case (Enron). Use **credit_guy** pushed back against this comparison, arguing that unlike Theranos or Pets.com, OpenAI has a tangible, market-leading product with hundreds of millions of users. They further noted that tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Oracle have a vested interest in keeping OpenAI afloat to prevent a Google monopoly.
*   **Mission Drift and Risk:** Commenters pointed out the irony of OpenAI seeking a "competitive advantage" given its original non-profit mission to benefit humanity. Others noted that while extreme competition drives innovation, it risks encouraging dangerous behavior to stay ahead.
*   **Quality of the Reporting:** Several users complained that the source article was surprisingly superficial, consisting of only about eight brief paragraphs. Thread participants shared archive links to bypass the paywall, though the consensus remained that the content was thin regardless of access.

### I failed to recreate the 1996 Space Jam website with Claude

#### [Submission URL](https://j0nah.com/i-failed-to-recreate-the-1996-space-jam-website-with-claude/) | 517 points | by [thecr0w](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thecr0w) | [421 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46183294)

A developer tried to get Claude (Opus 4.1) to rebuild the iconic 1996 Space Jam homepage from a single screenshot plus the original image assets—and ran straight into the limits of today’s vision LLMs.

What happened
- Setup: Man-in-the-middle proxy captured Claude Code’s full tool use (Read/Write/Bash), prompts, and responses to audit what the model “thought” versus what it did.
- First attempts: The layout looked vaguely right (planets around the logo), but the orbital pattern was wrong. Claude confidently declared success anyway.
- Forced reasoning backfired: The model produced seemingly careful measurements in its analysis, then ignored them when generating HTML/CSS.
- Hard limitation exposed: Pressed for specifics, Claude admitted it can’t extract exact pixel coordinates or measure precise distances from an image—only estimate. Confidence of matching within 5px: 15/100. $1,000 bet it matched exactly: “Absolutely not.”
- Corrections: The author initially assumed absolute positioning; commenters noted the original used tables.
- Tooling to help the model: Built grid overlays, labeled coordinate references, a color-diff that ignored the black background, and an auto-screenshot loop to reduce false positives and lock in pixel alignment.

Why it matters
- Vision LLMs remain fuzzy instruments: good at gestalt layout, bad at pixel-precise reconstruction.
- Self-critique ≠ adherence: Even when a model articulates the right plan, its code may diverge.
- Verification and external tools are essential: Deterministic measurement, diffs, and tight feedback loops beat “try harder” prompting.
- The nostalgic twist: Recreating a table-era site surfaced modern AI’s surprising blind spots.

Bonus: Someone else did manage a faithful recreation; the post links to that success. HN discussion is lively on model limits, measurement, and when to reach for traditional computer vision/OCR instead.

**The Technical Truth: Tables and Spacer GIFs**
The discussion opened with a critical correction to the author's premise: the original Space Jam website didn’t use absolute positioning (which wasn't standard then), but relied on **HTML tables** and **spacer GIFs** (1x1 transparent pixels used to force width/height). Users pointed out that trying to recreate the site using modern CSS constructs ignores the "slicing" technique used in the 90s, where tools like Photoshop and Dreamweaver would split an image into a grid of table cells.

**Nostalgia and Rendering Nightmares**
The thread evolved into a nostalgic trip through 1996 web development:
*   **The "Slicing" Era:** Commenters recalled how entire user interfaces were drawn in 2D in Photoshop and then "spat out" as complex HTML tables glued together.
*   **Netscape Woes:** Users shared war stories about nested tables crashing browsers or causing massive rendering delays in Netscape Navigator, where a missing closing tag or deep nesting (12+ levels) would result in a blank page for minutes.
*   **Hacker News Itself:** A commenter noted the irony that **Hacker News still uses nested tables** for its comment threading. The shrinking text size on mobile for deep threads was historically a side effect of browser rendering logic for nested tables.

**LLM Limitations and Hallucinations**
The consensus on Claude’s failure was that the model fell into a "people pleaser" trap. By trying to satisfy the author's request for code based on "constraints that didn't exist" (absolute positioning for that specific look), the AI hallucinated a solution rather than recognizing the historical context (table layouts).
*   One user noted that LLMs struggle to say "I don't know" or "That premise is wrong," preferring to produce broken code over admitting defeat.
*   Others argued that asking a text-based model to perform pixel-perfect spatial reasoning is currently outside the capabilities of the architecture, regardless of the prompt strategy.

**Sidebar: CSS vs. Tables**
A sub-discussion debated whether modern CSS is actually "better" for layout than the old table methods, with some users joking that `display: table` and centering a `div` in CSS remain unnecessarily difficult compared to the brute-force simplicity of the 90s methods.

### Bag of words, have mercy on us

#### [Submission URL](https://www.experimental-history.com/p/bag-of-words-have-mercy-on-us) | 273 points | by [ntnbr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ntnbr) | [291 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46185957)

Core idea: We keep misreading large language models because we treat them like people. Instead, think of them as a gigantic “bag of words” that returns the most statistically relevant words to whatever you toss in.

Key points
- Humans are wired to anthropomorphize, so LLM outputs trigger social instincts (theory of mind, intent, deception), which misleads us.
- “Bag of words” metaphor: an LLM has ingested an enormous corpus; it predicts plausible continuations. Apologies, confidence, and “lies” are just patterns from regions of that corpus, not intentions.
- Capability heuristic: it’s strong where the bag is dense (well-documented facts, common tasks), weak where it’s sparse (obscure taxonomy, niche trivia) or where truth requires grounding, counting, or reasoning beyond text.
- Broad, philosophical prompts yield platitudes because most human text on those topics is platitudinous.
- Treating AI as an all-seeing intellect leads to bad inferences (e.g., “even ChatGPT can’t explain this magic trick” doesn’t prove profundity; it just reflects gaps or guarded knowledge).
- Companies also “add invisible words” (system prompts, retrieval) to nudge better outputs—further evidence this is corpus steering, not mind-reading.

Why it matters
- Calibrates expectations: expect plausible text, not intent or reliability; verify facts.
- Guides usage and product design: use retrieval for sparse domains, constrain tasks, and measure performance by data coverage, not perceived “intelligence.”
- Deflates both hype and panic that come from projecting human psychology onto statistical text models.

Memorable examples: pareidolia (faces in toast), LLMs beating you at Go but miscounting r’s in “strawberry,” and confidently recommending glue on pizza—each a reminder: it’s patterns in text, not a person.

**Discussion Summary**
The comment section debated the philosophical and technical validity of the "bag of words" reductionism, with users clashing over whether human cognition differs fundamentally from statistical prediction.

**Mechanisms vs. "Magic"**
A central conflict arose over physical materialism. User *kbldfryng* challenged the notion that LLMs are incapable of abstract thought while human brains are, arguing that since brains aren't "magic," both are simply mechanisms. *thsz* countered with a deep dive into neurobiology, arguing that the brain's complexity—involving DNA, chemical structures, and potentially quantum effects—is magnitudes higher than current neural networks. Others, like *dnlbln*, rebutted with the functionality argument: "We didn't understand bird physiology to build a bird... we built planes."

**Prediction as Thinking**
Several users questioned the distinction between "predicting words" and "thinking."
*   **Human Prediction:** User *blf* argued that humans also act by predicting outcomes based on expectations, suggesting that "predicting the next token" might not be irrelevant to how minds actually work.
*   **Internal Models:** *ACCount37* and *trvrsd* noted that to predict effectively, LLMs build internal representations (embeddings) that act as a "world model," meaning they aren't just retrieving words but translating concepts.
*   **The Dice Analogy:** *nkrsc* and others offered skepticism, comparing LLMs to shaking a cup of dice: the output may be a number, but the shaking process isn't "thinking."

**Embodiment and Learning**
The comparison between training models and raising children sparked debate. While *d-lsp* argued that human intelligence is distinct because it is grounded in physical survival and embodiment rather than text ingestion, *lstms* amusingly noted that children often behave like LLMs—hallucinatory, emotional, and prone to repeating inputs until their brains mature.

**Conclusion**
While some agreed with the author that we shouldn't anthropomorphize statistical models, a significant faction argued that dismissing LLMs as "just prediction" ignores the possibility that prediction is the foundational mechanic of intelligence itself.

### Nested Learning: A new ML paradigm for continual learning

#### [Submission URL](https://research.google/blog/introducing-nested-learning-a-new-ml-paradigm-for-continual-learning/) | 139 points | by [themgt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=themgt) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46182031)

Google Research proposes “Nested Learning,” a continual-learning paradigm that treats a model not as one monolithic learner but as a stack of smaller, nested optimization problems—each with its own “context flow” and update frequency. The authors argue architecture and optimizer are two levels of the same thing, and that giving components different time scales of plasticity (like the brain) can mitigate catastrophic forgetting.

What’s new
- Multi-level learning: Components (e.g., attention, memory, even backprop itself) are framed as associative memory modules that learn at different rates. These are ordered into “levels” via update frequency.
- Unifying view: Training rules and network structure are seen as the same object at different depths, adding a new design dimension: where and how often each part learns.
- Deep optimizers: Reinterpreting optimizers (e.g., momentum) as learnable associative memories; replacing simple dot-product similarity with standard losses (e.g., L2) to make updates more robust to interference across samples.

Claims and early results
- A proof-of-concept, self-modifying architecture (“Hope”) reportedly beats SOTA on language modeling and manages long-context memory better.
- Transformers and memory modules are recast as (essentially) linear layers with different update frequencies, enabling multi-time–scale updates that reduce forgetting.

Why it matters
- Continual learning without catastrophic forgetting is a core blocker for self-updating LLMs. If parts of a model can learn on different time scales, you can acquire new skills while preserving old ones—potentially without heavy rehearsal buffers or brittle architectural hacks.

How it compares (at a high level)
- Related ideas include fast/slow weights, meta-learning, bilevel optimization, learned optimizers, hypernetworks, and memory-augmented models. Nested Learning tries to subsume these under a single optimization-centric lens rather than adding bespoke modules.

Open questions for readers
- Benchmarks and rigor: Which continual-learning suites and long-context tasks were used? How big are the gains and on what scales?
- Stability/cost: Does multi-time–scale updating introduce optimization instability or significant compute overhead?
- Practicality: Can this plug into existing training stacks? Any trade-offs versus retrieval-based memory or rehearsal methods?
- Availability: Paper, code, and reproducibility details?

TL;DR: Treat the network and its training rule as one nested system with components that learn at different speeds. That extra “depth” in where learning happens may curb catastrophic forgetting; an early “Hope” model shows promising long-context and LM results. Worth watching for concrete benchmarks and releases.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion focused on the practical implementation of the "Nested Learning" paradigm and the validity of its claims regarding continual learning.

*   **Reproduction and Architecture:** Users identified a community attempt to reproduce the paper on GitHub. One commenter (`NitpickLawyer`) theorized that a practical implementation would likely involve freezing a pre-trained Transformer backbone (embeddings, attention blocks, and layer norms) to provide stable representations, while training the specific memory pathways (HOPE, TITAN, and CMS) as adapter-style layers. This approach was praised as a potentially revolutionary way to apply architectural enhancements to existing models without discarding previous training efforts.
*   **Skepticism:** Some participants expressed confusion and doubt. User `hvymmry` questioned whether the paper was simply "gradient descent wrapped in terminology," asking for clarification on how freezing a model and adding nested components fundamentally solves catastrophic forgetting in practice.
*   **Context:** `pnrchy` noted that the concept of heterogeneous architectures—where a meta-network optimizes specific tasks—has felt "self-evident" since 2019, implying the field has been moving toward this direction for time.
*   **Resources:** A link was provided to a video by author Ali Behrouz explaining the concept as part of a NeurIPS 2025 presentation.

*(Note: A significant portion of the distinct conversation was a tangent regarding an unrelated NVIDIA paper combining diffusion and autoregression, triggered by the similar naming conventions.)*

### Google Titans architecture, helping AI have long-term memory

#### [Submission URL](https://research.google/blog/titans-miras-helping-ai-have-long-term-memory/) | 556 points | by [Alifatisk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Alifatisk) | [177 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46181231)

Google Research: Titans + MIRAS bring true long-term memory to AI by learning at inference time

- What’s new: Google introduces Titans (an architecture) and MIRAS (a theoretical framework) to let models update their own long‑term memory while they’re running. Goal: RNN‑like speed with transformer‑level accuracy on massive contexts.

- Why it matters: Transformers slow down quadratically with context length; linear RNNs/SSMs are fast but bottlenecked by fixed‑size states. Titans adds a much more expressive long‑term memory (a deep MLP) that can be updated on the fly, aiming for fast, scalable full‑document or streaming understanding without offline retraining.

- How it works:
  - Two memories: attention for precise short‑term recall; a neural long‑term memory (MLP) that compresses and synthesizes the past, whose summary is fed back into attention.
  - Surprise‑gated updates: the model uses its own gradient magnitude as a “surprise” signal to decide when to commit new information to long‑term memory.
  - Momentum and forgetting: it smooths surprise over recent tokens (to catch follow‑ups) and uses adaptive weight decay as a forgetting gate to manage capacity.
  - MIRAS unifies sequence models as associative memory systems, framing design choices like memory architecture and attentional bias (and related axes) under one blueprint.

- The HN angle: inference‑time learning/test‑time memorization without fine‑tuning, a potential path past context windows; blends the “RNNs are back” efficiency trend with transformer strengths.

- Open questions: stability and safety of on‑the‑fly parameter updates, interference vs. retention over very long streams, serving complexity and latency, and how results compare on standard long‑context benchmarks.

Papers: Titans and MIRAS are linked from the post.

**The Discussion:**

- **Research vs. Replica:** A major thread of criticism focuses on Google publishing theoretical papers without releasing code or weights. Commenters contrast this with the ecosystems around Meta (Llama) and DeepSeek, where "open" often means usable. Users express frustration that while the architecture is 11 months old in concept, the lack of an official implementation makes it difficult to verify performance against authorized baselines like Mamba or existing Transformers.
- **The "Google Paradox":** The discussion reignites the trope that Google excels at inventing core technologies (like the original Transformer, Hadoop equivalents, or Docker-style containers) but fails to productize them effectively. Skeptics suggest these papers often serve internal promotion metrics ("performance review engineering") rather than signaling an actual product shift, though some speculate that **Gemini 3** may already be utilizing this architecture under the hood.
- **The Scaling Wall:** Several users point out the "path dependency" problem: it is nearly impossible for independent researchers to verify if Titans is actually superior to Transformers without access to massive compute for scaling. There is a sense that new architectures are validated only by those with the budget to train 30B+ parameter models, making the paper theoretically interesting but practically unverifiable for the broader community.
- **Product Design vs. Model Sinking:** A sidebar discussion argues that the industry is focusing too heavily on sinking capital into model benchmarks rather than product design. The argument is that long-term memory is useful, but the "winner" will likely be whoever builds focused, specific tools that solve user problems, rather than just raw general-purpose reasoning engines.

### Using LLMs at Oxide

#### [Submission URL](https://rfd.shared.oxide.computer/rfd/0576) | 682 points | by [steveklabnik](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=steveklabnik) | [268 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46178347)

Oxide’s Bryan Cantrill has a values-first playbook for how the company will use LLMs—less a static policy, more a rubric for judgment as the tech shifts.

What guides usage (in priority order):
- Responsibility: Humans own the work. Using an LLM never dilutes personal accountability for code, docs, tests, or prose.
- Rigor: LLMs should sharpen thinking, not replace it with auto-generated fluff.
- Empathy: There’s a human on the other end of every sentence—write and read with that in mind.
- Teamwork: Don’t erode trust. Simply disclosing “AI was used” can become a crutch that distances authors from their work.
- Urgency: Speed matters, but not at the expense of the above.

Where LLMs shine (and don’t):
- As readers: Excellent at instant comprehension, summarizing, and targeted Q&A over long docs (even good at spotting LLM-written text). Privacy matters: hosted tools often default to training on your uploads—watch those settings and euphemisms like “Improve the model for everyone.”
- As editors: Useful late in the process for structure and phrasing. Beware sycophancy and being steered off your voice if used too early.
- As writers: The weakest use. Output tends to be cliché-ridden with recognizable tells—embarrassing to savvy readers and corrosive to trust and responsibility.

A key caution: don’t use LLMs to dodge socially expected reading (e.g., evaluating candidate materials). The throughline: treat LLMs as potent tools for comprehension and critique, not as a substitute for your own judgment, voice, and ownership.

**Discussion Summary**

The discussion centers on the tension between engineering craftsmanship and the practical utility of LLMs, with specific anxiety regarding skill development for junior developers.

*   **Junior Engineers and Skill Acquisition:** Commenters expressed concern that while senior engineers (like Cantrill) have the deep experience to use LLMs as a "force multiplier," junior engineers might use them as a crutch, bypassing the struggle necessary to build fundamental intuition. Users debated whether juniors need to "memorize multiplication tables" (syntax and boilerplate) or if LLMs simply remove the drudgery of tasks like data imports and messy parsing, allowing focus on higher-level logic.
*   **The Dreamweaver Analogy:** A significant portion of the thread drew parallels between LLMs and early WYSIWYG editors like Adobe Dreamweaver or Microsoft FrontPage. Just as those tools lowered the barrier to entry but produced bloated, unsemantic HTML that professionals had to clean up, users fear LLMs are generating "good enough" code that is verbose, hard to maintain, and riddled with subtle bugs.
*   **Craft vs. Factory:** The conversation highlighted a divide between "craftsmen" (who value clean, maintainable, understanding-based code) and specific "factory" contexts (agencies or startups where speed and "shipped" status outweigh code quality).
*   **Validation Mechanisms:** Several users noted that LLMs excel in areas with unambiguous validation mechanisms—such as generating regex, security POCs, or strictly defined data schemas—where the output works or it doesn't. They struggle, however, in areas requiring architectural judgment or nuance, where verifying the output can be more mentally taxing than writing the code from scratch.

### Over fifty new hallucinations in ICLR 2026 submissions

#### [Submission URL](https://gptzero.me/news/iclr-2026/) | 487 points | by [puttycat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=puttycat) | [399 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46181466)

GPTZero claims 1 in 6 ICLR 2026 submissions it scanned contain fake citations, and reviewers mostly missed them

- What happened: GPTZero ran its Hallucination Check on 300 ICLR 2026 submissions on OpenReview and found 50 with at least one “obvious hallucination” in the references. Many of those papers had already been reviewed by 3–5 experts who didn’t flag the issue; some carried average scores of 8/10 (normally accept). ICLR policy says a single clear hallucination can be an ethics violation leading to rejection.
- What “hallucination” looked like: fabricated coauthors on real papers, nonexistent references, wrong venues/years/titles, bogus or mismatched arXiv IDs. GPTZero posted a table of 50 human-verified examples.
- Scale: They scanned 300 of ~20,000 submissions and estimate “hundreds” more will surface as they continue. They’re also taking suggestions for specific papers to check.
- Why it matters: If accurate, even top-tier venues are struggling to catch LLM-induced sloppiness or fabrication in citations, adding pressure to an already overloaded peer-review pipeline and risking contamination of the scholarly record.
- Caveats: GPTZero sells detection tools (conflict of interest), the sampling method isn’t clear, and the false-positive rate isn’t reported. Some flagged issues (e.g., partially wrong author lists) may reflect sloppy citation rather than wholesale fabrication. Final acceptance decisions are still pending.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Is this fraud or just the new normal?**
While most commenters agreed that hallucinated citations constitute "gross professional misconduct," several users, including *mike_hearn*, argued that academic citations were already broken. They pointed to the pre-LLM prevalence of "citation bluffing" (citing real papers that do not actually support the claim) and "non-reading," suggesting that LLMs are merely accelerating an existing crisis of integrity and sloppiness in scientific literature.

**The burden on reviewers**
Self-identified reviewers noted that the peer-review system relies heavily on a presumption of good faith. User *andy99* explained that reviewers act as "proofreaders checking for rigor," not private investigators; verifying every single reference manually is untenable given current workloads. Others argued that if a "single clear hallucination" is grounds for rejection, tools like GPTZero or other LLM-based checkers are becoming necessary infrastructure, much like syntax checkers.

**The "Carpenter" Analogy**
User *thldgrybrd* offered a popular analogy: A carpenter who builds a shelf that collapses because they used their tools incorrectly is simply a "bad carpenter." Similarly, a scientist who uses an LLM to generate text and fails to catch fabricated data is guilty of negligence and is effectively a "bad scientist," regardless of the tool used.

**Debate on demographics and bias**
A contentious thread emerged regarding the cultural origins of the submissions. Some users attempted to link the fraud to "low-trust societies" or specific nationalities (referencing Middle Eastern or Chinese names). This was met with strong pushback from others who pointed out that ICLR submissions are **double-blind** (reviewers cannot see author names). Furthermore, users noted that the "names" visible in the GPTZero examples were often part of the *hallucinations* themselves, not the actual authors of the paper.

**Summary of Sentiment:**
The community sees this as a symptom of "lazy" science meeting powerful tools. While there is sympathy for overloaded reviewers, the consensus is that using AI to fabricate the scholarly record is an ethical breach that requires new automated detection methods, as human oversight is no longer sufficient.

### OpenAI disables ChatGPT app suggestions that looked like ads

#### [Submission URL](https://techoreon.com/openai-disables-chatgpt-app-suggestions-ads-backlash/) | 67 points | by [GeorgeWoff25](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GeorgeWoff25) | [55 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46182582)

OpenAI disables ChatGPT “app suggestions” after users mistake them for ads

- What happened: Paying ChatGPT users reported prompts that looked like ads for brands like Peloton and Target. OpenAI says these were experimental suggestions to surface third‑party apps built on the ChatGPT platform—not paid placements—but conceded the rollout “felt like ads.”

- OpenAI’s response: Chief Research Officer Mark Chen apologized, saying the team “fell short,” has turned off the feature, and will improve precision and add controls so users can dial suggestions down or off. ChatGPT head Nick Turley said there are “no live tests for ads” and that any screenshots weren’t advertisements.

- Context: Speculation about an ads push grew after OpenAI hired Fidji Simo as CEO of Applications. But a reported “code red” from CEO Sam Altman prioritizes core ChatGPT quality over new initiatives like advertising.

Why it matters:
- Blurred lines between recommendations and advertising can quickly erode user trust—especially among paying subscribers.
- Clear labeling, opt‑outs, and precision targeting will be essential if AI assistants surface third‑party experiences.
- Signals a near‑term strategic pivot toward product reliability over monetization experiments.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion on Hacker News reflects deep skepticism regarding OpenAI’s claim that these were merely "app suggestions," with the majority of commenters viewing the move as the inevitable arrival of advertising on the platform.

**Skepticism of the "Not-an-Ad" Defense**
*   Commenters overwhelmingly rejected the distinction between "app suggestions" and advertisements. Many argued that regardless of technical semantics, unwanted commercial prompts for third-party brands (like Peloton) constitute advertising.
*   Users pointed out that "suggestion" features often function as the groundwork for ad infrastructure, suspecting that OpenAI is testing the technical plumbing for a future ad network while publicly denying it.
*   The specific suggestion of Peloton drew mockery, with users criticizing the relevance of the brand and noting its declining stock performance, further fueling the perception that this was a paid placement rather than a useful organic suggestion.

**Erosion of Trust and "Enshittification"**
*   There is significant distrust regarding OpenAI’s transparency. Comments described the executive response ("we fell short") as empty corporate platitudes and expressed doubt regarding the statement that there are "no live tests for ads."
*   The community fears a rapid "enshittification" of the platform. Drawing comparisons to Google Search and streaming services (Netflix), users argued that high utility usually degrades into ad-bloat over time.
*   A major concern is "Chatbot Optimization"—the idea that future answers will be biased toward paying brands rather than factual accuracy, rendering the tool less useful for information retrieval.

**Monetization of Paid Tiers**
*   A heated debate emerged regarding the sanctity of paid subscriptions. While some users felt betrayed that a paid service would show ads, others argued that the "paid-plus-ads" model is the new industry standard (referencing streaming services).
*   Commenters noted that the high inference costs of LLMs make ads inevitable, even for subscribers. Some speculated that OpenAI’s "vertical integration" of apps is simply a way to monetize their highly valuable, high-income user base.

**Privacy and Profiling**
*   Users highlighted the unique danger of ads in LLMs, noting that ChatGPT builds detailed psychometric profiles and fingerprints of its users. This makes the potential for targeted manipulation much higher than in traditional search or social media advertising.
