### State tax officials are using AI to go after wealthy payers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/15/state-tax-officials-use-ai-to-go-after-wealthy-payers.html) | 13 points | by [perihelions](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=perihelions) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40046152)

New York State's tax department is getting serious about auditing high earners, reporting a 56% increase in audits in 2022, even with fewer auditors. The secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence. Using sophisticated AI algorithms, the state is targeting individuals who have potentially avoided paying taxes, especially those who have relocated during the pandemic to low-tax states like Florida or Texas. By analyzing factors like cellphone records to determine residency and work patterns, the state is challenging the legitimacy of these moves and holding individuals accountable for taxes owed.

Additionally, New York is scrutinizing remote workers, arguing that even if someone lives outside the state, if they work for a New York-based company, they are still liable for New York taxes. The state's "convenience rules" are leading to audits based on the idea that if someone retained belongings in New York, they didn't truly move, despite having established homes in other states. These aggressive tactics are part of a broader trend where state tax authorities are leveraging AI to target high-income individuals and ensure tax compliance. It's a reminder that even in the digital age, tax authorities are keeping a close eye on financial activities.

The discussion on the submission mainly revolves around the use of Artificial Intelligence by New York State's tax department to audit high earners and remote workers for potential tax evasion. Some users express concerns about the AI programs examining phone records of taxpayers and argue about the legality and necessity of such tactics. There are also mentions of challenges in crafting legal defenses against AI-driven investigations and the potential biases that AI systems may exhibit. Additionally, there are comments highlighting the historical context of FICO scores, questioning the impact of AI on middle-class taxpayers, and discussing the scrutiny of phone records in tax examinations.
