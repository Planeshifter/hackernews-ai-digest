In a world long before the digital age, ancient engineers and craftsmen crafted wondrous automata that blurred the line between human and machine. From the elaborate special effects in the throne room of Constantine VII to Mark Antony's theatrical use of automata, these mechanical marvels aimed to evoke a sense of the miraculous. Automata were not always designed to unsettle; they often delighted and entertained audiences. In medieval Cairo, automata graced palaces, such as the singing girls carved from camphor and amber that charmed guests with their movements. One of the most influential works on automata was Ismail al-Jazari's "The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices," featuring intricate devices like the hand-washing tower with a bejeweled peacock. Al-Jazari's influence extended across continents, shaping the evolution of automata in Europe and the Middle East. Table fountains, popular in medieval times, exuded whimsy and enchantment, such as the elaborate fountain at the Cleveland Museum of Art. Legends of hidden automata guarding treasures beneath the earth captured the imagination, reflecting a belief in the enduring legacy of ancient empires through these mechanical guardians.

### Conditional Love for AWS Metadata Enumeration

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.plerion.com/conditional-love-for-aws-metadata-enumeration/) | 19 points | by [kiyanwang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kiyanwang) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39508239)

The latest findings in AWS security reveal a potential vulnerability that could allow attackers to access sensitive metadata from public AWS resources by enumerating account IDs. This technique, inspired by a previous researcher's work, involves exploiting the "s3:ResourceAccount" condition key to guess account IDs and gain unauthorized access to resources.

By leveraging specific IAM policy conditions, attackers can manipulate AWS API calls to test different account IDs systematically, significantly reducing the guesswork involved. This method not only demonstrates the importance of secure AWS configurations but also highlights the need for continuous vigilance against potential attacks.

Furthermore, the research extends beyond S3 buckets to identify other resources vulnerable to this enumeration tactic, such as Data Exchange data sets and Lambda URL invocations. This discovery underscores the ongoing efforts required to safeguard cloud environments and underscores the significance of proactive security measures in the face of evolving threats.

The discussion on the submission about AWS security vulnerability revolves around the potential attack vector that allows attackers to access sensitive metadata from public AWS resources. 

- **ComputerGuru** points out that understanding AWS doesn't mean there is a flaw in the system; a denial response does not necessarily indicate a failure in the policy, and requests can succeed. They mention a case where streaming content through signed URLs in AWS buckets could circumvent standard non-public bucket procedures, highlighting that the attack method may not work depending on the request fulfillment. 
- **Temporary_31337** suggests that fixing the issue might be challenging in AWS as making IAM (Identity and Access Management) more restrictive could have unintended consequences. They raise concerns about the difficulty in patching/improving the system due to potential compatibility issues and the risk of breaking existing setups, emphasizing that making it harder to exploit could also limit legitimate use cases.
- **ncrnk** comments on a specific method for figuring out the AWS Snowflake internal stage buckets and Snowflake sharing through VPC Endpoint Policies.

The conversation underscores the complexity of addressing the vulnerability and the importance of carefully balancing security measures with system usability to prevent potential attacks.

### Mamba Explained: The State Space Model Taking On Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kolaayonrinde.com/blog/2024/02/11/mamba.html) | 252 points | by [koayon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=koayon) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39501982)

Today on Hacker News, the spotlight is on a new player in the world of AI models - Mamba. While Transformers have been dominating the AI scene, a fresh alternative called State Space Models (SSMs) has entered the ring with promises of similar performance and faster processing speeds. Mamba tackles the issue of long sequences by eliminating the quadratic bottleneck in the Attention Mechanism, allowing it to handle million-token sequences efficiently. The Mamba authors claim that their model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches those twice its size in both pretraining and downstream evaluation tasks. This breakthrough opens up a realm of possibilities across various modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

Diving deeper, Mamba's approach differs from the traditional Transformer architecture by using a Control Theory-inspired SSM for communication between tokens while retaining MLPs for computation within tokens. This innovative structure aims to address the limitations of Transformers, particularly the quadratic bottleneck that hampers performance with increasing context size. By providing an intuitive analogy involving Temple Run, the article elucidates how Mamba leverages the concept of state dynamics to predict optimal outcomes based on current observations.

In the age of Transformers where attention is key, Mamba's emergence offers a fresh perspective on how AI models can handle massive amounts of data efficiently. Could Mamba be the next big thing in AI? Stay tuned for more updates on this intriguing development!
