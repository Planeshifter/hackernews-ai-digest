### Computing Inside an AI

#### [Submission URL](https://willwhitney.com/computing-inside-ai.html) | 89 points | by [pongogogo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pongogogo) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42415875)

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, there's a compelling argument to rethink our approach to interaction with large models like ChatGPT. Traditionally, we've treated these AIs as "agents" akin to human assistants, which encourages slow, conversation-based exchanges. This model-as-person metaphor, while intuitive, restricts our ability to harness the true power of AI.

A fresh perspective proposed is the model-as-computer metaphor. This conceptual shift urges us to view AI more like robust applications on our devices, leading to a more efficient and dynamic way of interaction. Instead of merely typing queries into a text box, users would engage with an AI through a rich graphical interface. Picture buttons, sliders, and visual aids that make exploring capabilities more intuitive and immediate.

This interactive approach emphasizes two major improvements: Discoverability and Efficiency. By offering a visual toolkit, AI can suggest various functionalities and guide users on how to achieve their goals—similar to how design software presents editing options. Recognizing the limitations of text-based input, the model-as-computer framework allows for quicker, more precise manipulations. Imagine exploring creative possibilities in real-time rather than through an extended conversation.

As we continue to traverse the early stages of powerful AI, questioning prevailing metaphors and embracing new ways of interaction can help unlock the full potential of these technologies. The future of AI isn’t merely about increasing model size or complexity but also about revolutionizing how we communicate and create with these tools.

The discussion on Hacker News centered around the proposed shift from viewing large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT as "agents" (human-like assistants) to seeing them as "computers" (robust applications). Several commenters reacted to this metaphor change, emphasizing the challenges and potential benefits of a more interactive graphical interface for AI.

1. **Text-based Limitations**: Many participants noted the inefficiency of text-based conversations, which can feel slow and limiting. They argued that a graphical interface could facilitate quicker, more intuitive interactions with AI, enabling users to explore features and functionalities dynamically, through buttons and sliders instead of lengthy exchanges.

2. **Discoverability and Control**: Users pointed out that a well-designed interface could improve discoverability, making it easier to access features and functionalities that would otherwise be hidden in text prompts. Some commenters suggested that the existing model was too restrictive and failed to leverage the full power of AI.

3. **Challenges of Implementation**: Not everyone agreed on the practicality of this new approach. Some voiced concerns about technical limitations, suggesting that building such interfaces might require considerable effort and rethinking from current systems.

4. **Human vs. Machine Interaction**: There was a debate about the best way to communicate with AI. While some favored the richer interaction model, others suggested that human-like conversation is still a valid and necessary avenue, encapsulating the subtleties of human dialogues that could be lost in purely graphical interfaces.

5. **Potential for Revolutionizing AI Usage**: Overall, the discussion underscored the potential for changing user interfaces to unlock new capabilities in AI, emphasizing the need for innovation not just in model complexity but in how users interact with these technologies. The dialogue highlighted a clear recognition of the evolving nature of AI interaction as an essential consideration for future developments. 

Participants acknowledged that implementing such an interface would not be straightforward and would require new thinking in user experience design and accessibility for non-technical users.

2. **Burden of Paperwork**: Some commenters highlight the significant time police officers spend on paperwork and how AI could potentially reduce this burden, while others argue that potential shortcuts could lead to inaccuracies that harm defendants' rights or civil liberties.

3. **Effectiveness and Bias**: Several users reference the inherent biases and the potential for inaccuracy in AI systems. There's a discussion around how these biases could affect the justice system, especially in sensitive cases, raising concerns about accountability and transparency.

4. **Cost and Resource Allocation**: There are debates concerning the financial implications of implementing such technology in policing versus traditional methods. Discussions around police budgets and resource allocation hint at broader systemic issues in law enforcement funding and priorities.

5. **Transparency and Data Integrity**: Commenters emphasize the need for transparency in data handling and the potential consequences if AI-produced reports are not subjected to rigorous scrutiny and validation.

Overall, the conversation reflects a critical stance towards the use of AI in law enforcement, advocating for careful consideration of civil liberties, accuracy, and the ethical implications of automated technology in such a sensitive field.

### A ChatGPT clone, in 3000 bytes of C, backed by GPT-2 (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://nicholas.carlini.com/writing/2023/chat-gpt-2-in-c.html) | 344 points | by [chubot](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chubot) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42396372)

In an intriguing development, Nicholas Carlini has crafted a minimalistic implementation of the GPT-2 model in just 3,000 bytes of C code, designed to run dependency-free on modern machines. Despite the compact size, the code efficiently handles core tasks like matrix math, input encoding, and transformer inference. This self-contained clone offers a unique peek into the architecture of language models, albeit with low output quality—perfectly serviceable for a quick-and-dirty ChatGPT-like experience.

The approach involves clever optimizations, including KV caching and matrix multiplication algorithms that facilitate quick responses. While the GPT-2 Small version produces responses in seconds, the caveat remains: the output isn’t comparable to modern iterations like GPT-4. 

The implementation details a modular structure—with specific sections for matrix operations and I/O handling—culminating in an interesting conversation capability using basic ASCII inputs. While it can run on simple systems, be prepared for limitations in context handling that might require significant memory for larger models.

Carlini’s project not only showcases a throwback to earlier AI models but also offers a lightweight alternative for developers interested in experimenting with conversational AI without the overhead of larger frameworks. The full code is available on GitHub, inviting coders to test and tinker with the minimalist chatbot.

In the discussion surrounding Nicholas Carlini's minimalist implementation of GPT-2, several themes emerged. Users shared their experiences playing GPT-2 and noted its surprisingly decent conversational abilities, although they pointed out that its responses can be less coherent compared to advanced models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. Some commenters reminisced about past AI implementations and offered mixed opinions on the quality of the outputs generated by this compact version.

Technical discussions arose about the complexities behind the performance of language models. Some users expressed admiration for running such a small model while observing limitations in training data and performance, questioning the feasibility of competing with bigger, more sophisticated models trained with vast datasets. The functionalities of the model were highlighted, especially its potential for experimentation in conversational AI without the heavy requirements of larger frameworks.

Users also debated whether the low output quality was a significant drawback or if it was acceptable given the model’s size and simplicity. The discourse included both critiques and praise for Carlini's work as a demonstration of the basic principles behind transformer models, with some acknowledging the curiosity it piques about constructing simplified alternatives to state-of-the-art AI solutions.

Overall, while there were differing opinions on the practicality and usability of such a minimalistic model, the discussion underscored a shared interest in exploring lightweight AI methods that can operate effectively within constrained resources.
