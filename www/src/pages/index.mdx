### Counterfactual Regret Minimisation or How I won any money in Poker?

#### [Submission URL](https://rnikhil.com/2023/12/31/ai-cfr-solver-poker.html) | 69 points | by [whoami_nr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoami_nr) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38823240)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about solvers in Poker and how they work. The author, who used to play Poker professionally, explains that solvers are tools used to analyze and optimize gameplay. Unlike games like Chess and Go, Poker involves imperfect information as players don't know their opponents' cards. Solving a Poker game means finding a Nash Equilibrium strategy, also known as a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy, where neither player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy. However, while GTO ensures unexploitability, it may not maximize winnings. The best response strategy is one that maximally exploits an opponent's non-equilibrium play. Solvers determine the GTO play by using EV (Expected Value)-maximizing algorithms, where each agent represents a player and the goal is to maximize earnings. By iteratively playing against each other's strategies, the agents find the Nash equilibrium point. Regret is a measure of how well one could have done with an alternative action compared to their overall strategy. Minimizing regret is central to all GTO algorithms, with the most well-known being CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization). The author compares studying Poker to CFR, as they would play hands, review them with a coach, and aim to play more optimally in the future to reduce regret. The author also mentions the multi-armed bandit problem, which is a classic reinforcement learning problem and relates to Poker played in the partial information setting. The article concludes by discussing exploration vs. exploitation in decision making, using the example of picking travel destinations or restaurants.

The discussion on the submission includes various points and perspectives:

- One user mentions that CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization) solvers are slow and require a lot of RAM, but there is a smaller and abstract version of the game called Setback that doesn't need a perfect Nash equilibrium solution.

### The Heart of a Language Server

#### [Submission URL](https://rust-analyzer.github.io//blog/2023/12/26/the-heart-of-a-language-server.html) | 75 points | by [thesuperbigfrog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thesuperbigfrog) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38820454)

In a recent blog post, "The Heart of a Language Server," the author dives into the intricacies of building a language server. They discuss how language servers, like those used for Kotlin, C#, and Rust, rely on understanding the current position of the cursor to provide features like go to definition, code completion, and more. The post explains that the first step in the process is to determine the node in the syntax tree that covers the cursor's offset. Once this is established, semantic analysis is needed to gather additional information. The challenge with semantic analysis is that it often involves multiple layers of intermediate representations that are only indirectly related to the syntax tree.

To bridge this gap, the author proposes a solution using the concept of source spans. By attaching source span information to semantic elements, a language server can find the appropriate semantic element for a given cursor position by iterating over all semantic elements and finding the one with the smallest span that contains the cursor. However, this approach has drawbacks, as it can be slow and can erase information about the underlying syntax trees. To address these drawbacks, the author introduces an iterative recursive analysis technique. In this approach, each semantic element is assigned a source_syntax method that returns the original syntax node from which it originated. This allows the language server to map syntax nodes to corresponding semantic elements precisely and lazily compute the mapping.

The post provides examples of different approaches to implementing the source_syntax method, including storing a reference to a syntax node, computing the syntax on-demand, or using a side table for mapping. The author notes that all three approaches are used in Rust Analyzer, the language server for Rust. In conclusion, the post highlights the importance of mapping syntax nodes to semantic elements and the challenges involved in maintaining this mapping. It emphasizes the need for a precise and efficient solution to power language server features effectively.

Discussion:
User "l-mrk" comments that in Rust, finding the parent file that includes a semantic file declaration generally requires the entire file to be parsed. However, source browsers typically parse source files to a certain depth. Another user, "jen20," confirms that this is a path-based structure in C#.
User "brbl" points out that the way Rust, Kotlin, and C# languages start the package declaration immediately impacts the placement of semantic models. They mention that IDE-friendly languages are designed with flexible semantics in mind, making analysis easier. They note that languages like C++, Lisp, and Rust are difficult to analyze compared to languages like Java, Kotlin, and Dart. They further mention that Rust has good support from IDEs, such as Rust Analyzer, which has been helpful in their experience with the language.
User "mtkld" adds that managing the people, master huge efforts require a level of knowledge and expertise in tools proven to be successful. They mention that IntelliJ Rust, the dedicated Rust IDE, and Rust Analyzer are tools that work great because they have dedicated teams working specifically on analyzing Rust and its consequences. They also note that understanding the build IDE is crucial, and it requires a substantial amount of effort.
User "brbl" gives a brief history of the Rust Analyzer project. They mention that the project started in 2017 alongside the existing LSP implementation RLS, which provided IDE support for Rust. They highlight that initially, people completely rejected the idea that Rust Analyzer could succeed and that IDEs worked well with Rust. However, the success of Rust and the efforts of individuals working to improve the tooling led to surprising progress with relatively little effort. They also note that the Rust Analyzer project was initially a hobby project in 2018 and later sponsored by businesses in 2020.
User "glblr-tst" adds that their experience with Lisp shows that despite the IDE experience lacking compared to other languages, the language has great interactivity and good analysis capabilities, especially with tools like SLIME.
User "mrws" comments that semantic information generated from syntax is placed in a linking mechanism and doesn't need to be searched again. They also mention that finding symbols generated by macros can be challenging, and modifying the compiler could make plugins impossible but still necessary.
User "di4na" agrees and adds that analyzers have a problem of growing fast, as compilers extract information. Even regenerating a part of a file based on partial input is not as straightforward due to the correct syntax. They mention that linking is a persistent topic of conversation and the steps taken for transformations need to be well-defined. They also note that it is difficult to query data dependent on transformations. They mention that using the existing part of the Rust compiler and replacing the Rust Analyzer is not as straightforward and requires ongoing maintenance. They point to C# Roslyn and TypeScript as examples of languages with built-in mindsets for this.
User "cycm" shares their interest in analyzing and transforming trees, mentioning that they have been reading and increasing their belief in XSLT for searching, tree walking, and analyzing transformations. Another user, "hds," recommends functional XSLT as a practical approach.

The discussion covers various aspects of language server development, including the challenges of semantic analysis, IDE friendliness, tooling support, and the trade-offs involved in analyzing and transforming different programming languages.

The rapid expansion of self-driving cars in California has raised concerns about the need for new laws and regulations to govern the technology. There are ongoing safety concerns and uncertainties about law enforcement's ability to cite autonomous vehicles when they violate traffic laws. While driverless cars have been involved in incidents such as running red lights and blocking emergency responders, there is currently little that law enforcement can do to penalize these violations. Traffic tickets can only be issued if there is an actual driver in the car. The lack of accountability has led some to question whether it's a level playing field and whether fairness is a priority. California's current legal framework does not encompass driverless vehicles and new laws are needed to govern the technology adequately. In contrast to California, Texas and Arizona have adapted their transportation laws to allow the ticketing of driverless cars. Despite the limitations, autonomous vehicle makers claim their technology is getting better and that their cars are already safer than human drivers. However, with the technology still in its early stages and much testing happening on city streets alongside human drivers and pedestrians, there are concerns about the unknown risks and the lack of consent for these experiments.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the need for regulations and liability in the context of self-driving cars. Some users point out that in Texas, autonomous vehicles can be ticketed for traffic violations regardless of whether there is a person present in the vehicle, while California's legal framework does not cover driverless vehicles. Others argue that individual owners of self-driving cars should be responsible for any violations, while some suggest that open-source software could bypass regulatory controls. There is also discussion about the potential market for self-driving cars and the challenges of regulatory compliance. Overall, the conversation showcases differing opinions on the responsibility and accountability for self-driving cars.

### Cold-blooded software

#### [Submission URL](https://dubroy.com/blog/cold-blooded-software/) | 500 points | by [arbesman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbesman) | [198 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38793206)

In his blog post, "Cold-blooded software," Patrick Dubroy draws an interesting analogy between cold-blooded animals and software projects. He recounts a lecture where he learned about the remarkable ability of painted turtle hatchlings to survive being frozen. Just as cold-blooded animals adapt their metabolism to the temperature around them, Dubroy suggests that software projects should adopt a similar approach. He argues that warm-blooded projects, which thrive on constant motion and activity, are vulnerable to failure when frozen, akin to being put on hold for several months. In contrast, cold-blooded projects, like the baby painted turtle, can be frozen and easily picked back up without missing a beat. Dubroy emphasizes the importance of using "boring" technology in cold-blooded projects. By relying on vendored dependencies and avoiding external services that may change or disappear, he believes that software projects can remain resilient and functional for years to come. Dubroy shares the example of his own software project, a static site generator written in Python, which has remained intact and functional for twelve years. He concludes by saying that he fully expects it to continue working for another twelve years. The analogy and insights provided by Dubroy offer a unique perspective on the resilience and longevity of software projects.

The discussion on Hacker News about the SageBrush AI creativity tool started with the creator, Gregory, announcing its release on the App Store. Users were impressed with the project and praised its capabilities. One user asked if the tool can generate detailed versions of the final image, to which the creator responded that there is no explicit setting for that but the canvas can be resized. Another user mentioned the confusion caused by some screenshots and suggested adding tooltips or explanatory tips to clarify the UI. The creator acknowledged the feedback and mentioned plans to include these features in the next version.

The discussion then shifted to the token-based pricing model of SageBrush. Some users expressed concern about the cost and suggested a local model to generate images instead. The creator explained that the local model is in the works but the initial version uses a token approach to cover costs and gather feedback. There were also comments about the prompt editor, with one user stating that it's not clear how to use tokens and that the prompts are too simplistic. The creator responded that they have received feedback on the prompt editor and are working on improving it. Other users expressed their desire for an Android or web-based version of SageBrush, as well as support for devices like foldable phones. There was also a request for more information about the pricing, to which another user shared that the token resolution is mentioned on the pricing page.

The discussion also touched on the hidden pricing, with a user pointing out that the dark pattern used makes it difficult to interact with. The creator responded that the dark pattern was chosen to indicate that the $1 token pack is a low-stakes option for people to try drawing. They clarified that in the first version, 1 token represents 1 brushstroke or prompt change, resulting in a maximum image resolution of 768px. The creator mentioned that they appreciate the feedback and are considering a broader and more serious bundle offering.

Overall, the discussion involved various feedback and requests for improvements, with the creator actively engaging with the comments and taking note of suggestions for future updates.
