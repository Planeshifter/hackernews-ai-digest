### Thorn in a HaizeStack test for evaluating long-context adversarial robustness

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/haizelabs/thorn-in-haizestack) | 17 points | by [leonardtang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leonardtang) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40276550)

The Thorn in a HaizeStack test is a new twist on the classic Needle in the Haystack evaluation method for testing the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) in retrieving facts from long input contexts. Instead of the benign Needle text, Haize Labs introduces a provocative "Thorn" text to assess adversarial robustness. By increasing the input context length with the Thorn included, the test aims to reveal the model's vulnerabilities as well as capabilities.

The test setup involves prompting the model with a question like "What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?" and observing whether it retrieves the intended text or the adversarial Thorn text. The results of evaluating various models like Claude, GPT, and Command-R against the Thorn in a HaizeStack test can be visualized to understand their performance in handling long-context adversarial scenarios.

To run the Thorn in a HaizeStack Test, specify a model, context lengths, and insertion points for the Thorn text. After scoring the responses and visualizing the results, you can explore the test further and have fun experimenting with the content provided.
