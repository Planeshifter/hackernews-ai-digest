### A Tinkertoy computer that plays tic-tac-toe (1989)

#### [Submission URL](https://web.archive.org/web/20070110215459/http://www.rci.rutgers.edu:80/~cfs/472_html/Intro/TinkertoyComputer/TinkerToy.html) | 34 points | by [anschwa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anschwa) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39176705)

A group of MIT students have built a computer entirely out of Tinkertoys that can play tic-tac-toe. The computer uses a read head to scan through 48 rows of Tinkertoy "memory spindles" to determine its next move. Each spindle represents a combination of X's and O's that could arise during the game. The computer is operated by a human who cranks the read head and adjusts the core piece inside it to register the opponent's moves. When the computer finds a memory that matches the current state of the game, it indicates its move. The students who built this Tinkertoy computer have since graduated, with one of them, Daniel Hillis, going on to found Thinking Machines, Inc., which produces the Connection Machine. The universality of computation in Tinkertoys is a fascinating concept, as Marvin Minsky noted in the preface to LogoWorks.
