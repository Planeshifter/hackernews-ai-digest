### State tax officials are using AI to go after wealthy payers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/15/state-tax-officials-use-ai-to-go-after-wealthy-payers.html) | 13 points | by [perihelions](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=perihelions) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40046152)

New York State's tax department is getting serious about auditing high earners, reporting a 56% increase in audits in 2022, even with fewer auditors. The secret weapon? Artificial Intelligence. Using sophisticated AI algorithms, the state is targeting individuals who have potentially avoided paying taxes, especially those who have relocated during the pandemic to low-tax states like Florida or Texas. By analyzing factors like cellphone records to determine residency and work patterns, the state is challenging the legitimacy of these moves and holding individuals accountable for taxes owed.

Additionally, New York is scrutinizing remote workers, arguing that even if someone lives outside the state, if they work for a New York-based company, they are still liable for New York taxes. The state's "convenience rules" are leading to audits based on the idea that if someone retained belongings in New York, they didn't truly move, despite having established homes in other states. These aggressive tactics are part of a broader trend where state tax authorities are leveraging AI to target high-income individuals and ensure tax compliance. It's a reminder that even in the digital age, tax authorities are keeping a close eye on financial activities.

The discussion on the submission mainly revolves around the use of Artificial Intelligence by New York State's tax department to audit high earners and remote workers for potential tax evasion. Some users express concerns about the AI programs examining phone records of taxpayers and argue about the legality and necessity of such tactics. There are also mentions of challenges in crafting legal defenses against AI-driven investigations and the potential biases that AI systems may exhibit.

### Cipherleaks is the first demonstrated attack against AMD SEV-SNP (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://cipherleaks.com/) | 36 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40016468)

Today on Hacker News, the spotlight is on CIPHERLEAKs, the first attack demonstrated against AMD SEV-SNP. This attack leverages a vulnerability in the design of SEV's memory encryption to breach the constant-time RSA and ECDSA implementation in the latest OpenSSL library, using the ciphertext of the encrypted VM Save Area as side channels. By monitoring changes in the ciphertext, attackers can infer changes in the corresponding plaintext, enabling them to breach encryption methods. The root causes of this vulnerability lie in two features of SEV: the use of XOR-Encrypt-XOR (XEX) encryption mode with a fixed entropy tweak function that leads to the same plaintext having the same ciphertext, and the lack of prevention of the hypervisor from accessing the ciphertext of the encrypted memory, creating a ciphertext side channel.

Two case studies are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the CIPHERLEAKs attack, showing that the private keys of RSA encryption and secret nonces in ECDSA signatures can be recovered with 100% accuracy. The CIPHERLEAKs attack has been disclosed to AMD, who has acknowledged the vulnerability and filed an embargo until August 10, 2021, with a CVE number assigned to the vulnerability. AMD has also announced a security bulletin and a hardware patch for SEV-SNP in August 2021 to address the issue. For more details, the research paper on CIPHERLEAKs can be accessed to understand the full extent of the attack. Researchers involved in this discovery include individuals from The Ohio State University, Baidu Security, and NIO Security Research.

This exploit affects all SEV, SEV-ES, and SEV-SNP supported by AMD EPYC server processors, and the vulnerability has been reserved under the CVE number CVE-2020-12966.

SEV (Secure Encrypted Virtualization) is an AMD Virtualization extension that provides security features for virtual machines, while SEV-SNP (Secure Nested Paging) is a recent addition aimed at protecting against attacks exploiting memory integrity flaws. As software solutions may not be effective due to collection of function's internal state by Advanced Programmable Interrupt Controller (APIC), hardware-level patches from AMD are expected to mitigate the CIPHERLEAKs attack.

The discussion on the CIPHERLEAKs submission includes various points:

1. **H8crilA** mentions exchanging information about side-channel solutions involving various kinds of steps in response to the vulnerability demonstrated in CIPHERLEAKs. They talk about Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), Clouds, the FBI vs Apple encryption dispute, corporate staff meetings being hacked with malware, and the distrust towards DRM and anti-cheating mechanisms. They point out the importance of controlling privileged kernel code and utilize Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) as a potential solution.
2. **the8472** notes that Intel has discontinued desktop chips that use Software Binary Player Digital Rights Management (DRM) with SGX, emphasizing a shift in their technology focus.
3. **stypc** appreciates the addition of the 2021 tag to the submission.
4. **tus666** brings up the frustration around highly annoying exclusive domain names registered for individual CVEs. **frgmd** discusses human psychology and how certain domain names evoke emotional responses, highlighting the impact they can have indirectly. **mistrial9** dives into the visibility and costs associated with domain names, expressing concerns about the vanity aspect and how it can lead to various manipulations and complications in the cybersecurity domain. **xnthr** suggests pricing domain names at $30 per year or less to deter vanity exploitation. **sqgz** mentions a price of $10 per year for domain names.

Volexity recently uncovered a zero-day exploitation of a critical vulnerability in Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS GlobalProtect, marked as CVE-2024-3400. The attack involved a threat actor, known as UTA0218, remotely exploiting the firewall device to gain unauthorized access, create a reverse shell, and download additional tools onto the compromised system. The attacker's primary focus was on extracting configuration data from the devices and using it to move laterally within victim organizations. Through collaboration with Palo Alto Networks, the vulnerability was confirmed as an OS command injection issue with a severity rating of 10.0 on the CVSS scale. Palo Alto Networks has released an advisory for CVE-2024-3400, including a threat protection signature and a fix expected by April 14, 2024.

Volexity's investigation revealed that UTA0218 attempted to install a custom Python backdoor, named UPSTYLE, on the firewalls to execute additional commands via network requests. The attacker's tactics included deploying malicious payloads and moving swiftly through victims' networks to gather sensitive information and credentials. While the full extent of the exploitation is not yet determined, organizations using Palo Alto Networks GlobalProtect firewall devices are advised to review the advisory for protection measures. It's crucial to take proactive steps to ensure systems are secure and investigate for potential compromises to prevent unauthorized access. The incident highlights the importance of prompt security measures in response to zero-day vulnerabilities and emphasizes the need for continuous monitoring and mitigation strategies to safeguard against sophisticated cyber threats.
