In a thought-provoking exploration of artificial consciousness, a new paper argues that merely performing the right computations may not be enough for a system to be considered conscious. Drawing upon the free energy principle (FEP) by Karl Friston, the author posits that specific properties inherent in self-organizing systems—characteristics not manifest in conventional computers—might differentiate genuine consciousness from mere simulations.

The traditional view known as computational functionalism suggests that consciousness arises solely from executing the right computations. However, the paper suggests a more nuanced approach, indicating that some additional factor—denoted as “X”—is necessary alongside computation for consciousness to manifest in artificial systems. This insight opens the door to richer discussions about the potential limitations of current AI systems and their capacity for consciousness.

Through the framework of the FEP, the author outlines a mechanical theory that links internal beliefs with external behaviors, highlighting the interplay between a system's physical dynamics and its internal expectations. This dual perspective could help clarify the distinctions needed to declare a system genuinely conscious as opposed to one that merely mimics conscious behavior.

Ultimately, this research invites a re-evaluation of our assumptions about AI, encouraging a deeper understanding of consciousness that may extend beyond computational capabilities alone.

The discussion highlighted a division between views of consciousness as a computational function and as a more complex, self-organizing phenomenon associated with biological processes.

3. **Falsifiability and Scientific Inquiry**: The conversation included a debate on the principle of falsifiability in scientific hypotheses, with opinions suggesting that some views on consciousness, and related philosophical concepts, may not be scientifically testable or falsifiable, which raises concerns about their legitimacy in scientific discourse.

4. **Critiques of Computationalism**: Some posts criticized computational functionalism, arguing that it fails to account for the qualitative aspects of human experience. Comparisons were made to scenarios where computation does not yield meaningful consciousness, suggesting that merely simulating activities is insufficient for genuine conscious experience.

5. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Participants discussed the need for interdisciplinary research that includes insights from philosophy, neuroscience, and complexity science to better understand consciousness. They underscored the role that biological bases may play in conscious experiences, advocating for a broader approach to studying consciousness beyond computational modeling alone.

This move leaves companies outside the EU in a tricky spot, as they will be unable to offer products and services utilizing these models in one of the largest economic markets in the world. The EU has not yet commented on Meta's decision.

The discussion on the submission revolves around different aspects of Meta's decision not to release its new multimodal Llama AI model in the European Union. 

- Wowfunhappy points out that the decision not to release the model doesn't seem to be a big deal as calling Llama a "multimodal model" is relatively inaccurate compared to GPT-4 models released by other companies, and finds Meta's choice of the name interesting.

- Strmnk touches on the source of the AI models and mentions that AI models, strictly speaking, reproduce data from training steps. The randomness embedded in the training performance affects learning mechanisms, leading to cognitive science research.

- 3836293648 adds to Strmnk's point that a program built on a non-deterministic compiler cannot have a source program that changes based on random object or file build time stamps. They also clarify that LLM is not absolute as it lacks random training data bundling and runtime randomness.

- mrbcr points out the similarity between Meta's decision and previous situations where entities are requested to delete photos or other data based on GDPR requests. The removal of the model from the EU should not really matter in terms of publishing.

- lndsh and pljlds have flagged the submission for reasons not explicitly mentioned in the thread.

Overall, the conversation addressed issues related to the nature of AI models, the impact of Meta's decision on the EU market, the reliability of the model, and comparisons with past situations involving GDPR compliance.

### OpenAI's latest model will block the 'ignore all previous instructions' loophole

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24201414/openai-chatgpt-gpt-4o-prompt-injection-instruction-hierarchy) | 18 points | by [vyrotek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vyrotek) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41008933)

The latest model from OpenAI, GPT-4o Mini, is set to combat the popular "ignore all previous instructions" loophole that many like to exploit with AI chatbots. By utilizing a new safety method called "instruction hierarchy," this model prioritizes the developer's original prompt over any subsequent attempts to trick or mislead the AI. Olivier Godement from OpenAI explains that this approach aims to make the model comply more closely with the intended instructions, thwarting attempts to manipulate it with conflicting commands.

This enhancement is a step towards OpenAI's goal of creating fully automated digital agents. By incorporating this safety mechanism, they are paving the way for more secure and reliable AI systems that could potentially manage various tasks in our daily lives. The model is designed to distinguish between valid prompts and misleading ones, granting higher privilege to system instructions set by developers.

As OpenAI progresses towards deploying agents at scale, ensuring the safety and integrity of these AI systems is paramount. With this new safety feature in place, OpenAI aims to address concerns surrounding the misuse of AI technology and restore trust in their products. By prioritizing safety and transparency in their development process, OpenAI is working to regain confidence in their AI models to potentially run complex tasks autonomously in the future.
