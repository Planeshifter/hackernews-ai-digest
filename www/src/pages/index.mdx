In a groundbreaking new approach to speech synthesis, Llasa has cracked the code on how to effectively scale train-time and inference-time compute for Llama-based models. As text-based language models like GPT and o1 grow more complex, so too do the demands of integrating them with text-to-speech (TTS) systems. Traditional methods involve multi-stage, cumbersome processes that complicate scaling decisions during model training or testing.

The Llasa framework, however, pioneers a streamlined path to dynamic speech synthesis using a single-layer vector quantizer codec alongside a Transformer architecture. This innovative setup aligns perfectly with Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA, delivering a cohesive, efficient solution. Analyses reveal that enhancing train-time computing power significantly boosts the naturalness of generated speech and enriches prosody complexity. Conversely, scaling inference-time compute introduces refined emotional expressiveness and accuracy via speech model verifiers, adjusting sampling to match specific verifier preferences.

Moreover, Llasa's commitment to open science shines brightly. They've publicly released training code and checkpoints across various model sizes (1B, 3B, 8B).

In a thought-provoking article, Daksh Gupta, co-founder of Greptile, delves into the intriguing world of AI-driven code development and review. With AI increasingly authoring code and sparking questions about whether the technology should also be responsible for reviewing its own work, Gupta sheds light on the nuances of such a practice.

The article begins with an exploration of a power law revealing that AI bots like "devin-ai-integration[bot]" are generating more pull requests than any individual human. This observation raises the critical question of whether the AI responsible for writing code should also be tasked with reviewing it, potentially challenging the traditional need for a fresh set of human eyes in code reviews.

Several counterpoints are discussed: due to the stateless nature of AI, every code review undertaken by AI is indeed a fresh assessment. Moreover, the process of scaffolding in AI reviews creates workflows distinct enough from code generation to warrant them being seen as separate entities, even though they share the same underlying AI engines.

Gupta also dives into the human angle, noting that while author and reviewer remain biologically different, their shared training and context could make them not so distinct after all. Yet, reviews by AI are shown to spot bugs more adeptly than humans in some tests, highlighting both the value and the pitfalls of AI code generation.

### AGI Is Not a Milestone

#### [Submission URL](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/agi-is-not-a-milestone) | 34 points | by [steebo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=steebo) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43856762)

In a thought-provoking essay by Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan, the notion of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a milestone in AI's development is challenged. They argue that AGI, often seen as an imminent breakthrough, doesn't represent a clear-cut event with immediate, transformative impacts akin to the creation and deployment of nuclear weapons during the Manhattan Project. Rather than marking a sudden leap in technology, AGI might evolve through incremental advancements and human-like capabilities, like those demonstrated in OpenAI’s latest model o3.

The essay downplays the idea of AGI as a distinct tipping point that would surpass human control. The authors emphasize that AGI's significance lies not in reaching a specific capability threshold but in how AI systems integrate and diffuse across industries over time, requiring complementary innovations at a human pace. This perspective challenges fears of catastrophic risks associated with AGI, suggesting that power shouldn't be conflated with potential capabilities.

Kapoor and Narayanan further argue that the proliferation of AGI definitions is problematic, reflecting more about AGI's speculative impacts than its present reality. Evaluating whether an AI like o3 constitutes AGI, they propose, can only be meaningfully assessed in hindsight, not at a system’s launch. They criticize pervasive analogies of AGI to nuclear weapons, stating that such comparisons often result in misleading predictions and counterproductive policy recommendations.

Ultimately, even though some experts view models like o3 as exhibits of emerging AGI capabilities, the authors contend that these advancements—even if revolutionary in scope—are not clear indicators of having reached AGI. Instead, such developments should be seen as part of a continuing journey in AI's evolution, requiring caution, thoughtful design, and incremental growth rather than alarmist reactions or hasty declarations of breakthroughs.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a concrete milestone, sparked by an essay challenging its framing as a transformative breakthrough. Key points from the comments include:

1. **AGI as a Vague Concept**: Users debate whether AGI is a meaningful term or a marketing buzzword. Some argue its definitions are overly broad and speculative, allowing companies to exploit it for hype (e.g., OpenAI’s "o3" model reigniting debates despite unclear benchmarks).

2. **LLMs: Capabilities vs. Understanding**: While LLMs like ChatGPT are praised for linguistic prowess, critics emphasize they lack true understanding, functioning as "language calculators" without separable reasoning. Their success is attributed to pattern recognition, not cognitive depth.

3. **Industry Hype vs. Reality**: Commentators note the disconnect between AI’s commercial adoption (e.g., rapid ChatGPT uptake) and its limitations. The industry’s profit-driven promotion of AGI risks overshadowing incremental progress and practical applications in areas like energy systems or manufacturing.

4. **Physical and Cognitive Limitations**: Current AI’s inability to master physical tasks (e.g., robotics, plumbing) or match animal cognition (e.g., frogs) underscores the gap between specialized tools and hypothetical AGI. Even advanced models struggle with tasks requiring embodied intelligence.

5. **Incremental Progress Over Milestones**: Many reject the idea of AGI as a sudden leap, advocating instead for focusing on gradual advancements. The essay’s argument—that AGI’s impact hinges on integration into society, not a singular breakthrough—resonates, with users highlighting the slow, complementary innovations needed for meaningful change.

6. **Misleading Analogies**: Comparisons of AGI to nuclear weapons or industrial revolutions are criticized as hyperbolic. ChatGPT’s popularity, while significant, is seen as a tool rather than a paradigm shift, with overstated claims distracting from pragmatic safety and policy considerations.

In summary, the discussion reflects skepticism toward AGI as a defined milestone, emphasizing the need for nuanced evaluation of AI’s evolving role, grounded in real-world applications rather than speculative hype.

### A new sign that AI is competing with college grads?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/) | 72 points | by [Bluestein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bluestein) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43858495)

The job market for young, educated workers is experiencing a concerning turn, with unemployment rates for recent college graduates at an unusually high 5.8%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. This worrying scenario is echoed in struggles faced by even those holding newly minted M.B.A.s from elite programs. Law-school applications are on the rise, reminiscent of behaviors during the great financial crisis when graduate school became a refuge for young people.

Three potential explanations are being considered to unpack this shift. Firstly, the labor market for young people hasn’t fully bounced back from the long-standing effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and may even be carrying scars from the Great Recession. After hitting a peak in 2009, recovery was slow, only to be further disrupted by pandemic setbacks and ensuing economic measures to control inflation, particularly impacting tech and white-collar industries.

The second theory suggests a structural shift in the value of college degrees. Research indicates that since 2010, the lifetime-earnings gap between college and high-school grads has stabilized, while the demand for college degrees in job postings is dropping. This reflects an uncertain return on investment for higher education, contrasting with a positive trend for non-college-educated workers whose economic prospects have improved slightly since then.

Lastly, the role of artificial intelligence in transforming employment is also considered. Economists speculate that AI could potentially substitute traditional entry-level tasks performed by young graduates, indicating a more profound transformation in job dynamics. Today's graduates are stepping into an economy where their skills are not as in demand, pointing towards broader technological changes or economic caution among employers over hiring.

Despite alarming indicators such as the all-time low recent-grad gap—where young college graduates usually outshine the overall workforce for unemployment rates—the evidence for AI-induced job displacement remains ambiguous. Economic experts like LinkedIn’s chief economist, Karin Kimbrough, suggest the current job market is more reflective of employers’ cautious short-term hiring strategies rather than a digital displacement.

The unfolding labor landscape for young grads signals anything from short-term economic challenges to monumental shifts in the educational and technological fabric of employment. As Derek Thompson of The Atlantic writes, this is an important trend to monitor closely.

The Hacker News discussion explores the challenges young, educated workers face in the job market, focusing on AI's role, structural economic shifts, and debates about education. Key points:  

1. **AI’s Dual Role in Skill Development and Job Displacement**:  
   - Many commenters argue that AI tools (like LLMs) help automate entry-level coding tasks (e.g., writing sorting algorithms or debugging), saving time and boosting productivity. However, reliance on AI risks creating a "crutch" effect, where new graduates skip understanding fundamentals, akin to using calculators without learning math.  
   - Some worry AI could replace junior roles entirely, with employers opting for AI-supervised code reviews over human hires. Others counter that AI is merely a pragmatic tool, emphasizing that real-world work often prioritizes results over theoretical purity.  

2. **Structural Shifts in Education and the Job Market**:  
   - Concerns about college degrees losing value persist, as job postings increasingly de-emphasize formal education. Some suggest the pandemic, offshoring, and economic policies (e.g., ZIRP, Section 174 tax changes) have compounded job scarcity in tech and white-collar sectors.  
   - Schools are criticized for not adapting curricula to balance foundational knowledge with AI integration. A recurring analogy compares today’s AI reliance to past debates over calculators: while tools evolve, understanding core concepts remains critical.  

3. **Offshoring and Economic Factors**:  
   - Offshoring development and outsourcing to cheaper labor markets (e.g., LATAM, Asia) are cited as major factors squeezing entry-level roles. Companies cutting internal teams (e.g., QA) exacerbate the problem, while older workers delaying retirement limit openings for new grads.  

4. **Debates on Learning and Pragmatism**:  
   - A heated thread debates whether using AI “robs” learners of agency. One side argues it stifles deep understanding (e.g., treating systems as "black boxes"), while the other views it as a practical way to meet deadlines, acknowledging that professionals often rely on existing tools without full mastery.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects tension between embracing AI’s efficiency and fearing its erosion of foundational skills, alongside broader economic and structural challenges. The job market struggles of young graduates appear driven by a mix of technological disruption, corporate cost-cutting, and evolving educational relevance.

### "AI-first" is the new Return To Office

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anildash.com//2025/04/19/ai-first-is-the-new-return-to-office/) | 323 points | by [LorenDB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LorenDB) | [201 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43845089)

Tech CEOs are jumping on the latest bandwagon: declaring their companies to be "AI-first." This trend, spearheaded by Shopify's Tobi Lütke, involves demanding that AI usage be incorporated into performance reviews—a move that feels forced and unnecessary. In a humorous self-analysis, the author notes that while AI tools can be helpful for those less skilled in certain areas, they may not add value for those already excelling at their jobs. So why this push from the tech elite?

The phenomenon is likened to a form of groupthink, where tech leaders echo each other's phrases to show alignment with the latest industry trends. This has been seen before in the insistence on returning to the office and other performative behaviors. CEOs seem to be more interested in maintaining appearances within their exclusive circles than genuinely considering what might benefit their employees or the business.

A practical approach would be to offer evaluated AI tools as optional resources rather than mandatory requisites, allowing employees to choose what genuinely enhances their productivity. However, such a sensible strategy wouldn't fit in with the attention-seeking behaviors of tech tycoons who prefer to impose AI mandates as a way to signal their participation in the latest tech craze.

In conclusion, perhaps it's time to adopt a more balanced attitude towards technology—one that welcomes innovation without succumbing to fad-driven group pressures. Recognizing the value in diverse sources of innovation, including academia and open-source communities, could foster a more constructive and inclusive tech culture.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around critiques of Shopify CEO Tobi Lütke’s management style, dubbed the "Tobi Tornado," characterized by abrupt, disruptive changes and high-pressure demands. Commenters compare this to "Seagull Management," where leaders swoop in, impose decisions, and leave chaos in their wake. While some defend Tobi’s approach as effective for Shopify’s growth, others argue it fosters instability and employee burnout, likening it to Elon Musk’s controversial leadership at Tesla and SpaceX. Critics highlight the human cost of such methods, noting stress and disrespect for work-life balance.

Debates also address Shopify’s business practices, with users raising concerns about data privacy and legal compliance in Europe, accusing the company of "shady" tactics in handling customer information. Skepticism emerges about the sustainability of performative tech trends, such as mandatory AI integration, with calls for optional tools instead of top-down mandates. Broader themes include critiques of Silicon Valley’s obsession with hyper-productivity, the ethics of leadership styles prioritizing innovation over employee well-being, and the tension between founder-driven vision and organizational stability. The conversation underscores a desire for balanced, inclusive approaches to technology and management that value diverse perspectives beyond CEO-driven hype.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/PhialsBasement/Chain-of-Recursive-Thoughts) | 514 points | by [miles](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=miles) | [225 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43835445)

In today's Hacker News roundup, we delve into an intriguing project called "Chain of Recursive Thoughts" (CoRT), where an innovative approach has been applied to enhance AI decision-making. Created by the user PhialsBasement, this open-source venture explores the potential of making AI models ‘argue with themselves’ to improve their problem-solving skills. The methodology harnesses the power of self-evaluation and recursive thinking, pushing AI to generate multiple alternatives, rigorously assess them, and select the most optimal response.

The project has shown particularly impressive results when paired with the smaller-sized Mistral 3.1 24B model, dramatically boosting its performance, especially in programming tasks. Key to this success is the "AI battle royale" approach, where various potential solutions are pitted against each other, with only the top choice surviving to become the final answer. 

For those keen on experimenting, PhialsBasement provides clear instructions on setting up and running the code via a Web UI, though it's still in early development. Users interested in enhancing this innovative setup are encouraged to contribute, with the project licensed under MIT, giving plenty of freedom for creative adaptations and improvements.

This project underscores the power of iterative refinement and dynamic thinking in AI, making it a fascinating area for developers and AI enthusiasts eager to push the boundaries of machine intelligence.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion around the "Chain of Recursive Thoughts" (CoRT) project explores both enthusiasm and critical considerations for recursive AI verification methods. Key points include:

1. **Verification Challenges & Solutions**:  
   - While CoRT’s "AI battle royale" approach (generating multiple solutions and filtering via verifiers) shows promise, users note **task-dependent efficacy**. For example, mathematical proofs are easier to verify programmatically, but LLMs like GPT-4 often produce flawed reasoning that requires external checkers.  
   - In software engineering, LLM-generated code may include vulnerabilities, but verification tools (compilers, linters, test suites) can improve reliability. Automatic test reruns help but **require well-defined cases** to avoid false confidence.  
   - Some argue verification is harder than generation, though projects like CoRT demonstrate significant accuracy gains when combining LLMs with external validators.

2. **Practical Implementation**:

### An illustrated guide to automatic sparse differentiation

#### [Submission URL](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/2025/blog/sparse-autodiff/) | 121 points | by [mariuz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mariuz) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43828423)

In the bustling world of machine learning, we're all familiar with automatic differentiation, a method that swiftly calculates gradients essential for model optimization. But dive deeper, and you'll discover the lesser-known sibling: automatic sparse differentiation (ASD). This specialized process capitalizes on the sparseness of Hessians and Jacobians—those large, unwieldy matrices where most elements are zero—common in scientific and engineering applications. By focusing only on the non-zero elements, ASD can dramatically speed up computations and cut down on memory usage.

Our illustrated guide starts with the basics: understanding traditional automatic differentiation (AD) and its role in computing Jacobians using both forward and reverse modes. From there, we explore the heart of ASD, which hinges on two core techniques: detecting sparsity patterns and employing matrix coloring. These strategies enable the efficient calculation of sparse Jacobians, and subsequently, sparse Hessians.

For those entrenched in machine learning, the benefits are clear. While first-order optimization via gradients is standard, utilizing sparse structures can significantly enhance the performance of second-order methods, which deal with these large matrices. However, ASD remains underutilized, partly because its theoretical foundations were developed outside the mainstream machine learning discourse. This post aims to bridge that gap, showcasing how ASD can revolutionize computational efficiency in real-world applications.

Through a practical demonstration within the post, readers can see firsthand how ASD shines when handling high-dimensional data, providing benchmarks and scenarios where it surpasses traditional methods. By demystifying ASD’s approach to leveraging sparsity, this guide opens the door to faster, more memory-conscious machine learning optimizations, paving the way for broader adoption in cutting-edge applications.

### Generative AI is not replacing jobs or hurting wages at all, say economists

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/04/29/generative_ai_no_effect_jobs_wages/) | 331 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [478 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43830613)

In a fascinating twist on the tech narrative, a recent paper by economists Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard suggests that generative AI, despite being the tech industry's darling with billions in investment, hasn't quite delivered the economic revolution some predicted. Their study examined the impact of AI chatbots, like ChatGPT, across 11 job categories in Denmark, from educators to software developers, and found no significant wage or labor effects. 

This revelation complicates the tech industry's hype about AI's economic potential and raises questions about the massive capital poured into AI infrastructure. The economists' research indicated that while chatbot adoption is high, the economic benefits are minimal, with time savings clocking in at a mere 2.8% of work hours, tantamount to just over an hour per typical workweek. 

Interestingly, the speedy adoption of AI chatbots has not translated into drastic changes or benefits. Instead, it's reshaping jobs by creating new tasks, including those monitoring whether AI tools, like ChatGPT, are used for cheating—tasks that ironically eat into potential time savings. Humlum points out that while these new activities could, in a best-case scenario, lead to higher-value tasks and possibly wages, the overall productivity gains remain limited. 

Moreover, only a sliver of any productivity boost reaches workers' pockets, with just 3-7% seen in higher earnings. While AI might save time on activities like emailing, it doesn't necessarily mean employees can take on more work to increase earnings. This insight frames a backdrop where firms might reap more benefits than workers, casting a nuanced light on the AI advancement narrative and hinting at a future where the real economic game-changer status of AI is still on the horizon.

The discussion surrounding the study on generative AI's economic impact reflects widespread skepticism and nuanced debates. Key points include:

1. **Minimal Measurable Impact**: Users highlight the study’s finding of only **2.8% time savings** (≈1 hour/week) from AI tools, questioning whether such marginal gains justify the hype or investment. Critics argue these savings often fail to translate into wage increases, as companies absorb efficiency gains without redistributing benefits to workers.  

2. **Productivity vs. Wages**: A recurring theme is the disconnect between AI-driven productivity and wage growth. While AI might streamline tasks (e.g., drafting emails), participants note that saved time often leads to **new administrative burdens** (e.g., monitoring AI use) or increased workload demands rather than higher pay. Some argue companies prioritize revenue growth over employee compensation.

3. **Historical Analogues**: Commenters draw parallels to past technological shifts, like textile automation, which reshaped jobs without reducing employment long-term. Others cite **Jevons Paradox**—efficiency gains (e.g., cheaper software) may spur demand for new services, creating unforeseen roles while rendering others obsolete.

4. **Technical Realities**: Developers debate AI’s practical utility in technical fields (e.g., coding, UI design). While some praise tools like ChatGPT for accelerating tasks (e.g., generating code drafts), others note limitations, emphasizing that **baseline expertise** remains critical. Efficiency gains here are often incremental (e.g., saving 5% of time) rather than transformative.

5. **Economic Structures**: Discussions critique systemic factors, such as corporate greed, regulatory capture in education, and rising student debt, which may distort AI’s potential benefits. Critics argue markets increasingly favor price-fixing over competition, dampening consumer gains from AI-driven cost reductions.

6. **Skepticism of Hype**: Many dismiss the AI “revolution” narrative as market-driven speculation, stressing that real-world adoption often falls short of transformative claims. The study’s focus on Denmark is seen as a caution against overgeneralizing AI’s global impact.

In essence, the consensus leans toward **cautious doubt**: while AI introduces incremental efficiencies, structural economic forces and historical precedents suggest its revolutionary potential remains unrealized, with benefits disproportionately favoring firms over workers.
