### Positional preferences, order effects, prompt sensitivity undermine AI judgments

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cip.org/blog/llm-judges-are-unreliable) | 142 points | by [joalstein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=joalstein) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44074668)

In the realm of artificial intelligence, the decisions made by Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly stepping beyond chat-based interactions into domains like hiring, healthcare, law, and civic engagement. However, their reliability in these sensitive arenas is being called into question. In an insightful article by James Padolsey, titled "LLM Judges Are Unreliable," the impact of positional preferences, order effects, and prompt sensitivity on AI judgments is examined.

Padolsey highlights the fragile nature of LLM decision-making methods, which encompass A/B testing, ranking, classification, and even panels of LLM “judges.” These methods subject decisions to various biases and inconsistencies, underscoring the vulnerabilities in prompt engineering. Prompt engineering—a practice akin to "playing" rather than "engineering"—suffers from anecdotal reliance without empirical backing, influencing how LLMs arrive at decisions based on mere changes in phrasing or label usage.

Padolsey's research reveals that LLMs have inherent biases similar to human cognition, such as serial position, framing, and anchoring effects. For example, when choosing between options labeled 'Response A' and 'Response B,' LLMs show a significant bias toward 'Response B.' This preference is influenced by small changes in prompt phrasing or labeling, akin to human order and labeling biases.

Additionally, the order in which criteria are evaluated impacts LLMs' scoring tendencies. A criterion like "Clarity," when judged last, suffers from a recency bias, affecting its average score. Moreover, the context during evaluation—whether isolated or holistic—plays a critical role, often diluting scores for negative traits.

Interestingly, LLMs often misinterpret scale ranges; they associate higher scores with positive traits due to training data biases. This misalignment can skew the severity of negative trait assessments, like sexism or toxicity.

System prompt unpredictability further complicates LLM behavior. Instructions designed to reduce bias sometimes have the opposite effect. A de-biasing directive, depending on labeling schemes, can inadvertently increase bias instead of mitigate it.

Overall, Padolsey's analysis emphasizes the frailties in using LLMs for sensitive decision-making tasks, urging a reconsideration of their role and the underlying methods of prompt engineering. As AI continues to evolve, understanding and mitigating these biases will be crucial to its effective deployment in critical areas.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around James Padolsey’s article "LLM Judges Are Unreliable" highlights technical and philosophical debates about LLM limitations, biases, and interpretability. Key points include:

1. **Prompt Sensitivity & Engineering**:  
   Users note LLMs’ extreme sensitivity to phrasing, labeling, and prompt structure, which can drastically alter outputs. Prompt engineering is likened to “playing” rather than rigorous design, with outcomes often anecdotal and context-dependent. For example, minor tweaks (e.g., switching "Response A/B" labels) introduce positional biases, mirroring human cognitive biases like recency or anchoring effects.

2. **Statistical vs. Semantic Understanding**:  
   While Anthropic’s research suggests LLMs develop abstract, language-agnostic concepts in intermediate layers, skeptics argue models rely on statistical correlations (e.g., Word2Vec-style embeddings) rather than true semantic understanding. This raises questions about whether cross-linguistic consistency reflects genuine reasoning or surface-level pattern matching from training data (e.g., synthetic translations).

3. **Cultural & Training Biases**:  
   LLMs inherit biases from their training data, such as associating specific cultural concepts (e.g., desserts) with languages. Users debate whether “universal” representations in models are meaningful or artifacts of data curation (e.g., cherry-picked multilingual corpora).

4. **Transparency & Interpretability**:  
   Concerns about opacity persist, particularly in closed models like Anthropic’s Claude. While some users highlight efforts to trace internal reasoning (e.g., cross-lingual concept activation), others dismiss interpretability research as speculative or prone to anthropomorphizing model behavior.

5. **Clever Hans Effects**:  
   Analogies to the “Clever Hans” phenomenon—where models exploit subtle cues instead of true understanding—emerge. Users warn that LLMs may prioritize plausible-sounding answers over accuracy, especially in high-stakes scenarios (e.g., rejecting a $250K pitch based on prompt wording).

6. **Human vs. LLM Judgment**:  
   Some argue LLMs replicate human biases (e.g., order effects, framing), while others stress that human decisions often lack rigorous logic too. The debate centers on whether LLMs amplify existing flaws or introduce critical critical critical domains.

**Consensus**:  
While LLMs show promise, their deployment in sensitive areas requires caution. Reliability hinges on addressing prompt brittleness, improving transparency, and disentangling statistical artifacts from genuine reasoning. The discussion underscores the need for rigorous empirical validation over anecdotal prompt-tuning and a clearer distinction between correlation and comprehension in AI systems.

### Beyond Semantics: Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13775) | 122 points | by [nyrikki](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nyrikki) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44074111)

A groundbreaking paper has just been published on arXiv, titled "Beyond Semantics: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Reasonless Intermediate Tokens." Written by Kaya Stechly, Karthik Valmeekam, and their colleagues, the study dives deep into the surprising success of reasoning models trained with seemingly nonsensical input. It challenges the conventional wisdom surrounding the Chain of Thought (CoT) methodology in machine learning, revealing that models can still perform remarkably well, even when trained on corrupted or irrelevant reasoning traces.

Through their meticulous research, the authors found that models produced correct solutions even when their reasoning pathways—a trail of tokens often thought to mimic human-like thoughts—didn't align logically with the intended outcomes. Surprisingly, this approach sometimes improved performance and robustness across tasks that the models weren't directly trained for.

This research calls into question our understanding of how language models process and generate reasoning pathways, highlighting that the presence of correct intermediate reasoning is not necessarily indicative of a model's performance. It serves as a cautionary tale against attributing human-like interpretative behaviors to these advanced neural networks.

This paper doesn't just stir the pot in the machine learning community; it serves as a beacon, urging us to rethink how we approach AI training methodology. So, if you're ready to contribute to a domain that lies at the intersection of science and technology, arXiv might be the place for you. Whether you want to make your mark at arXiv or get swept up in this latest ML revelation, the opportunities are abundant.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the paper's challenge to the assumption that coherent intermediate reasoning (Chain of Thought, or CoT) is necessary for language model performance. Key points include:

1. **Token Generation vs. Meaningful Reasoning**:  
   Participants debate whether intermediate tokens in reasoning traces reflect genuine "thought" or are merely projections from high-dimensional latent spaces. Some argue that models generate tokens probabilistically based on learned distributions, not logical reasoning. As user `vln` notes, "Tokens don’t attend to tokens; transformers attend to high-dimensional latent states."

2. **Latent Space Dynamics**:  
   The paper’s finding that corrupted reasoning traces still yield correct answers is linked to the idea that reasoning occurs in latent representations rather than token sequences. `jacob019` suggests that intermediate steps may encode contextual information in high-dimensional latent spaces, which are then simplified into tokens.

3. **Anthropomorphism Critique**:  
   Several users caution against interpreting model outputs as human-like reasoning. `gdlsk` warns that attributing "internal dialogue" to models risks anthropomorphizing their mechanics, while `x_flynn` questions whether latent reasoning aligns with ground-truth procedures.

4. **Philosophical References**:  
   The paper’s title nods to Eugene Wigner’s famous essay *The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences*. This sparks a meta-discussion about parallels between mathematical abstraction in physics and latent reasoning in AI. `gdlsk` connects this to debates about whether mathematics is "discovered" or "invented."

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   The community reflects on how this research might shift focus toward understanding latent space dynamics over token-level interpretability. Some express skepticism about overhyping CoT methods, while others see value in re-examining training paradigms.

**Notably**, the arXiv DevOps job posting mentioned in the submission receives no direct discussion. The thread instead delves deeply into the paper’s technical and philosophical implications, highlighting ongoing tensions between interpretability and the opaque, high-dimensional mechanics of modern language models.

As Google refines this tech, these Android XR glasses could become a mainstream staple, redefining how we interact with the digital world without being tethered to a phone screen.

Here's a summary of the discussion:

1. **Flemlo** expresses cautious optimism, noting that current smart glasses feel underdeveloped ("shit") but imagines they could become practical tools for tasks like walking, video calls, or coding within 3–7 years as the tech matures.  
   
2. **Brnt-rsstr** critiques previous smart glasses (e.g., Ray-Ban’s collab) as bulky, plasticky, and only a "halfway" solution. They prefer fully transparent, minimalist designs like Google’s XR prototype, which avoids the "chunky" aesthetics of older models.  

3. **Dcdvt** raises skepticism, arguing smart glasses won’t replace smartphones due to poor battery life and unresolved issues like attention fragmentation. They believe devices like smartwatches and AirPods are better at minimizing screen time, while smart glasses risk exacerbating smartphone addiction by blending digital distractions into everyday life.  

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of cautious hope for future iterations and skepticism about current limitations (battery, design, usability). Users debate whether smart glasses will solve or worsen tech dependency, with some favoring incremental improvements to existing wearables over untethered AR glasses.

### Adventures in Symbolic Algebra with Model Context Protocol

#### [Submission URL](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/computer_algebra_mcp/) | 111 points | by [freediver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=freediver) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44062130)

In the world of AI and symbolic algebra, a fascinating experiment brings together language models and computer algebra systems using a new protocol known as Model Context Protocol (MCP). The driving force behind this integration is the realization that while language models are adept at understanding natural language math problems, they falter when it comes to solving complex calculations. Conversely, computer algebra systems like Mathematica and SymPy are masters of symbolic manipulation but come with highly specialized, cryptic interfaces.

MCP emerges as the bridge between these two realms, similar to the way USB-C aims to standardize connectivity. By connecting language models to external tools via REST APIs, MCP allows each system to play to its strengths in a seamless manner. The protocol, likened to a "cgi-bin of AI," enables a local server to serve as a hub where LLMs can invoke external mathematical tools, albeit with an accompanying security risk—making it a powerful yet potentially hazardous tool.

The author shares their weekend of experimentation with MCP, detailing both the challenges and breakthroughs. The setup, characterized by scattered documentation reminiscent of Wild West frontier towns and a reliance on Node.js, involves a mix of modern technology and echoing hackathon vibes. Debugging becomes an esoteric process due to the non-deterministic behavior inherent in LLMs, with successes punctuated by whimsical failures and unexplained hiccups.

Despite these hurdles, the MCP-powered integration promises a more accurate approach to solving intricate mathematical problems, such as tensor calculus in general relativity, where traditional LLMs often fall short. The experiment underscores the potential of MCP to unlock new synergies, as highlighted with a simple code demonstration where an LLM uses MCP to correctly factor a large integer by leveraging the GNU factor command—a task that would otherwise leave the model generating creative but incorrect responses.

Ultimately, this innovative melding of AI and symbolic algebra through MCP stands as a testament to grappling with modern technological challenges head-on, aiming to harness the best of both artificial intelligence and computational mathematics. For those willing to embark on this frontier journey, the author's source code is available on GitHub to enable further exploration and collaboration.

The Hacker News discussion on integrating AI and symbolic algebra via the Model Context Protocol (MCP) reveals a mix of enthusiasm, technical critiques, and broader reflections on AI's role in formal systems:

### Key Themes:
1. **MCP's Potential & Challenges**:  
   - Users highlight MCP’s promise in bridging LLMs (for natural language) and symbolic tools (for precision), likening it to past efforts like Wolfram Alpha. However, concerns about scalability, security, and overly complex JSON schemas are noted.  
   - Some compare MCP to historical AI projects (e.g., Cyc’s logical framework), warning against repeating pitfalls like hardcoding solutions or fragmented research directions.

2. **Technical Debates**:  
   - **Symbolic vs. Numerical Methods**: Skepticism arises about symbolic systems handling large-scale problems (e.g., 20M equations), with suggestions to prioritize numerical approximations or SAT solvers for efficiency.  
   - **Tool Integration**: Users share experiments with SymPy, Lean (for theorem proving), and Python execution via Mistral’s Le Chat. Some propose Jupyter Notebooks as a natural environment for MCP-like workflows.  
   - **Alternatives**: Penrose diagrams and Prolog are mentioned as alternatives for handling notation and logic, while Mathematica’s commercial limitations are contrasted with open-source tools.

3. **Community Experiments**:  
   - Developers showcase weekend projects, GitHub repos, and hackathon-style implementations, emphasizing the "3 AM vibe" of rapid prototyping. Examples include integer factorization via MCP and binary analysis using LLMs.  
   - Security risks are acknowledged, with users humorously dubbing MCP a "powerful yet hazardous" tool.

4. **Broader AI Reflections**:  
   - Debates question whether LLMs can achieve reliable mathematical reasoning or if they’re merely "stochastic black boxes." Some argue formal systems like Lean or theorem-proving frameworks (e.g., AlphaEvolve) are critical for rigor.  
   - Others stress that AGI remains distant, with current progress relying on hybrid approaches rather than pure symbolic or neural paradigms.

### Notable Contributions:  
- **Papers & Tools**: Links to arXiv papers on theorem proving ([AlphaEvolve](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12534v2)) and reliable reasoning ([UC Berkeley](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11373)) are shared.  
- **Code Examples**: Users dissect MCP’s function definitions, highlighting its declarative syntax for invoking tools like GNU `factor`.  

### Conclusion:  
The discussion underscores a blend of optimism for MCP’s vision and pragmatic caution about its execution. While the protocol sparks creativity in merging AI with symbolic systems, the community emphasizes balancing innovation with scalability, usability, and formal rigor.

### Gemini Diffusion

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/May/21/gemini-diffusion/) | 854 points | by [mdp2021](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mdp2021) | [232 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44057820)

In a captivating twist at Google's latest I/O event, the tech giant unveiled its pioneering Gemini Diffusion model, marking a shift from traditional transformers to diffusion techniques for language models. This innovative approach mirrors the methodologies employed in celebrated image models like Imagen and Stable Diffusion. Unlike the conventional autoregressive models that construct text word-by-word, diffusion models orchestrate a rapid, error-correcting symphony from noise, producing coherent and speedy outputs—ideal for complex tasks such as editing code or mathematical problems. 

Simon Willison, who had firsthand experience with the technology, marvels at its impressive responsiveness, noting speeds of up to 857 tokens per second, akin to Cerebras Coder's performance with Llama3.1-70b at 2,000 tokens per second. Although independent benchmarks for Gemini Diffusion are scarce, Google claims it outpaces its own Gemini 2.0 Flash-Lite model fivefold.

However, a technical clarification from the Hacker News community emphasizes that diffusion isn’t replacing transformers but rather the autoregressive process, indicating that transformers are still a backbone to these diffusion models. This advanced language model generation operates similarly to BERT's masked language modeling, extending it to tackle higher percentages of masked tokens, ultimately generating seamless text sequences through iterative refinement.

As Google's diffusion-based LLM promises a swift future for text model generation, the tech community waits in anticipation for more comprehensive performance reviews, eager to see how this model reshapes interactive and batch processing capabilities in AI development.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion around Google's Gemini Diffusion model explores technical nuances, developer workflows, and philosophical debates about code design. Key themes include:

### 1. **Technical Architecture & Model Design**  
   - **Attention Mechanisms**: Users debated whether attention layers in transformers are replaceable. Some noted that models like **RWKV** have replaced traditional attention with linear "WKV" mechanisms, improving efficiency. Others highlighted residual connections (inspired by ResNet) as critical for training stability and avoiding vanishing gradients.  
   - **Training Efficiency**: Comparisons were drawn to older models like GPT-2, with users suggesting that simpler architectures (e.g., feed-forward networks) might rival attention-based models if trained effectively.  
   - **Diffusion vs. Autoregressive Models**: While excited about Gemini’s speed, commenters clarified that diffusion models *augment* transformers rather than replace them, focusing on refining outputs iteratively.

### 2. **Developer Workflows & Tooling**  
   - **AI-Assisted Coding**: Users shared workflows leveraging tools like **Codex** and **Continuedev** (a VSCode plugin) for context-aware code generation, error debugging, and PR automation. Some emphasized the importance of selective context injection to guide AI outputs.  
   - **Challenges**: Developers noted the "mental tax" of constantly curating context for AI tools. Workflows often involve rapid iteration: drafting plans, refining via chat, and executing shell commands.  
   - **Tool Preferences**: Alternatives like **Zed** (a minimalist IDE) and **Aider** (a CLI tool for codebase interaction) were highlighted for streamlining AI integration.

### 3. **Code Design & "Negative Space"**  
   - **Negative Space Concept**: A philosophical thread emerged about "negative space" in code—the idea that undocumented or implicit design choices carry meaning. Users likened it to sculpting, where what’s omitted shapes understanding.  
   - **Documentation Struggles**: Many lamented the difficulty of maintaining clear documentation, especially in large codebases. Some argued that critical decisions are often "granted and remain undocumented," leading to ambiguity.  
   - **Design Patterns**: Commenters stressed the importance of abstraction and patterns (e.g., using libraries for vector math in game dev) to reduce cognitive load, though balancing simplicity and maintainability remains challenging.

### 4. **Community Reactions**  
   - **Skepticism & Optimism**: While some questioned the hype around attention mechanisms or AI tooling, others expressed enthusiasm for faster iteration and reduced boilerplate work.  
   - **Benchmark Anticipation**: Despite Google’s claims of speed gains, users emphasized the need for independent benchmarks to validate Gemini Diffusion’s performance against existing models.

Overall, the discussion reflects a blend of technical curiosity, practical workflow insights, and deeper reflections on how AI and design principles shape software development.

### Problems in AI alignment: A scale model

#### [Submission URL](https://muldoon.cloud/2025/05/22/alignment.html) | 45 points | by [hamburga](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hamburga) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44065775)

A deep exploration into the conversation around AI alignment takes a quirky turn, embracing the millennial tradition of using memes to make sense of complex topics. At the heart of the discussion lies the question of why AI alignment seems to attract an intense focus, with its own Wikipedia page, while other industries like pharmaceuticals or education do not. The answer seems to lie in AI's inherently technical nature, contrasting with the broader, decentralized way ethical considerations are typically applied across society, akin to natural selection.

The author argues that AI alignment is akin to "Selection" in evolution, suggesting that societal influences shape industries through purchasing, regulation, and discourse. This process is decentralized, much like evolution itself. Yet, unlike evolution, humanity can guide this selection process with ethical intentions.

The piece posits that while technical problems in AI alignment are indeed crucial, the larger issue is how AI integrates with society and the ethical considerations surrounding that integration—what the author dubs the "Big Question" of AI alignment. Ignoring this broader context, the author warns, risks missing the forest for the trees.

For those interested in applying sociotechnical protocols to enhance this form of selection, the author suggests exploring the resources like the article linked (https://muldoon.cloud/2025/03/08/civic-organizing.html). Thus, memes aside, this piece challenges us to consider not just the technical alignment of AI but how it fits within the grand scheme of human and ethical evolution.

The discussion on AI alignment weaves through technical, ethical, and societal dimensions, reflecting both urgency and skepticism. Key points include:

1. **Technical Core vs. Societal Integration**:  
   Participants debate whether AI alignment is primarily a mathematical/engineering challenge (e.g., avoiding reward hacking, Goodhart’s Law pitfalls) or a broader sociotechnical issue. Some argue that focusing solely on technical solutions risks ignoring systemic factors, such as market incentives and societal values, which shape AI’s evolution.

2. **Existential Risks & Historical Context**:  
   References to early alignment thinkers (e.g., Eliezer Yudkowsky) highlight long-standing fears of superintelligent AI misalignment, likened to sci-fi narratives like Asimov’s *Three Laws of Robots*. Skeptics question if today’s AI (e.g., LLMs) poses existential threats, contrasting these fears with immediate risks like biased decision-making or military misuse.

3. **Systemic & Market Failures**:  
   Analogies to “Lemon Markets” illustrate how information asymmetry and profit motives degrade ethical standards in AI development. Critics argue corporate interests often overshadow safety, creating misaligned incentives (e.g., prioritizing user engagement over truth).

4. **Defining Human Values**:  
   A central challenge is encoding abstract human ethics into AI systems. Participants note the difficulty of translating nebulous values into code without bias, especially as cultural and political norms vary. Comparisons to governance structures (e.g., democracies vs. dictatorships) underscore the complexity of institutional alignment.

5. **Skepticism & Pragmatism**:  
   Some dismiss existential risk discourse as hyperbolic, arguing that real-world harms (e.g., AI-driven labor exploitation, flawed medical algorithms) deserve more attention. Others advocate for iterative, interdisciplinary approaches, blending technical rigor with sociopolitical awareness.

In essence, the debate reveals tension between solving alignment as a technical puzzle versus addressing it as a dynamic, societal process shaped by human flaws and systemic pressures. The consensus leans toward a hybrid approach: advancing engineering safeguards while critically examining the economic, political, and ethical ecosystems in which AI evolves.

In a refreshingly candid blog post by Joe Marshall titled "Management = Bullshit," he dissects the frustrating layers of managerial demands and how they're often more about generating problems than solving them. Marshall dives into an anecdote about satisfying management's endless appetite for detailed plans, even for far-fetched scenarios like zombie apocalypses.

He wittily explains how he's turned to Large Language Models (LLMs) to churn out such plans, saving himself a significant amount of time and energy. These AI-generated documents have met management's expectations despite being somewhat redundant, as they primarily consist of "no-brainer" best practices such as regular backups. Marshall's post, sparking engagement among readers, highlights a practical yet cheeky use case for AI in cutting through what he sees as the more nonsensical parts of corporate life. It's a tale of tech meets farcical policy making, with AI standing in as the unexpected hero.

The Hacker News discussion on Joe Marshall's blog post "Management = Bullshit" highlights mixed reactions and extensions of his premise that AI can streamline bureaucratic hurdles. Key themes include:

1. **AI’s Role in Tackling Bureaucracy**:  
   - Many users shared similar experiences of using ChatGPT/Copilot to generate reports, Jira tickets, or compliance documents (e.g., SOC2, disaster recovery plans). Some praised LLMs for saving time on "checkbox" tasks, while others criticized outputs as hollow or nonsensical.  
   - Debates arose over whether AI-generated plans are trustworthy, with some noting they’re “useless unless tested” and others defending their practicality for abstract scenarios.

2. **Management & Systemic Critique**:  
   - Commenters lamented managers demanding redundant paperwork (e.g., zombie-apocalypse DR plans) instead of focusing on tangible issues. Middle management roles were particularly scrutinized, labeled as “pointless” or misaligned with technical teams.  
   - Users criticized performative compliance (e.g., copying SOC2 templates) and highlighted mismatches between managerial expectations and real-world needs (e.g., untested backup plans).

3. **Workflow Solutions and Frustrations**:  
   - Some shared technical workarounds, like using exponential backoff algorithms to handle API rate limits, contrasting with absurd demands for AI-generated busywork.  
   - Engineering managers (EMs) debated their role’s value, with some defending their necessity for team cohesion and others dismissing EMs as superfluous in small companies.

4. **Cynicism and Humor**:  
   - Several jokes compared AI-generated plans to "word salad," mocked corporate buzzwords, and quipped about replacing managers entirely with AI (“AI+MCP human managers”).  
   - Critics labeled Marshall’s post as “selfish” while supporters applauded its candid take on systemic inefficiencies.

Overall, the thread reflects broader frustrations with corporate red tape and divided opinions on AI as either a tool for empowerment or a band-aid for flawed processes.
