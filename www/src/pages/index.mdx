### The "it" in AI models is the dataset

#### [Submission URL](https://nonint.com/2023/06/10/the-it-in-ai-models-is-the-dataset/) | 101 points | by [alvivar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alvivar) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40152908)

OpenAI's researcher, reflecting on a year of training generative models, realizes that regardless of different configurations and hyperparameters, the models all converge to similar results by approximating their datasets extremely well. This remarkable finding suggests that with enough complexity, all models narrow down to the same point when trained on the same data for a sufficient duration. Surprisingly, it's not the architecture or training choices that determine a model's behavior, but the dataset itself. This insight implies that the key to model differences lies in the data rather than in the model's structure, shedding light on how models like Lambda, ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude are essentially representations of their datasets, not just their weights.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the significance of model architecture and hyperparameters in machine learning. Some commenters emphasize the importance of the right architecture in achieving success, while others argue that the dataset plays a more critical role in determining model behavior. There is a debate on whether large generative language models, such as LLMs, are primarily defined by their architecture or the training data they are exposed to. Additionally, the discussion touches on the role of model choices in machine learning competitions like Kaggle and the potential future directions of ML with regards to model architecture and data. The conversation also references the insights of prominent figures in the field, such as Yi Tay of Reka AI and Andrew Ng.

### The Nimble File Format by Meta

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/facebookexternal/nimble) | 48 points | by [zzulus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zzulus) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40163530)

Introducing Nimble, a new file format for storing large columnar datasets developed by Meta. Nimble aims to surpass formats like Apache Parquet and ORC with features tailored for wide workloads, extensibility through customizable encodings, parallel processing capabilities, and a unified library approach to prevent fragmentation. While still under active development, Nimble boasts lighter metadata organization, support for cascading encodings, and pluggable encoding selection policies. The self-sufficient CMake build system makes compiling Nimble straightforward, with dependencies including gtest, glog, folly, abseil, and velox. Testing has been conducted with clang 15 and 16, and the Apache 2.0 License governs Nimble's usage. Watch out for future updates on this promising project!

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission regarding the new file format Nimble had several interesting points raised by the community:

1. Some users expressed a preference for writing parsers with fewer dependencies to avoid potential environmental fragmentation, emphasizing the importance of a unified specification in Nimble to prevent this issue and encourage developers to leverage the library bindings provided by Nimble for high-quality integration.
2. Others highlighted the challenges of documentation and clear communication in open-source projects, drawing parallels with popular projects like Puppet and Chef where incomplete or outdated documentation can hinder adoption and understanding, stressing the need for clear context and curated learning resources.
3. There was a debate about the need for multiple implementations for testing, emphasizing the importance of a single implementation to avoid discrepancies between specification and implementation that could arise with multiple independent implementations.
4. Concerns were raised about untrusted file parsing in C++ and potential vulnerabilities that may arise, with a reference to a future timeframe, 2024.
5. A user shared a video link in the comments section and others discussed the differences between Nimble and Arrow/Parquet, with references to Lance and its potential advantages over legacy formats, noting the clarity and performance benefits of Nimble.
6. Some users discussed benchmarking and optimization strategies for Nimble, including preliminary benchmarks presented in a video focusing on machine learning sequential scenarios compared to analytical workloads.
7. The conversation also touched upon the benefits of MergeTree, ClickHouse's data format, and a humorous mention of the xkcd comic related to choosing data formats, suggesting a review of available options for comparison and Meta's potential involvement in the file format landscape.

Overall, the discussion provided insights into the community's perspectives on Nimble's features, potential challenges, and comparisons with existing file formats, highlighting the interest and areas of focus in further development and adoption of Nimble.
