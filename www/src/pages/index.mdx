### Big Tech says AI is booming. Wall Street is starting to see a bubble

#### [Submission URL](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/ai-bubble-big-tech-stocks-goldman-sachs/) | 71 points | by [jameslk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jameslk) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41087719)

A growing chorus of Wall Street analysts and tech investors is raising alarms about a potential financial bubble in artificial intelligence (AI), as massive investments from Big Tech, investors, and venture capitalists continue to pour in without clear signs of profitability. In recent discussions, Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced inquiries about when the company's hefty quarterly AI investments—amounting to $12 billion—might start yielding returns. Major institutions like Goldman Sachs and Barclays now caution that expenditures on AI could soon outpace the expected revenue, predicting a spending of around $60 billion by 2026 with only $20 billion in anticipated returns.

Amidst this skepticism, tech firms continuously assert the transformative potential of AI akin to that of the internet and mobile phones, with AI already enhancing tasks like document translation and email writing. However, analysts like Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs warn that current AI technologies are overhyped and may not be ready for widespread application, casting doubt on the long-term viability of extensive investments. Barclays emphasizes that despite the rush to develop new AI products, the reality may see fewer than the anticipated 12,000 successful applications emerging.

Vinod Khosla, a prominent Silicon Valley VC, echoes this sentiment, paralleling AI's trajectory with historical tech disruptions. While he acknowledges the risk of a bubble where many investors might lose money, he believes the foundational technology will ultimately thrive, predicting a future with multiple trillion-dollar AI enterprises.

Overall, as the AI landscape continues to evolve, the financial implications of these investments remain uncertain, with many stakeholders questioning whether the growth can match initial exuberance.

The discussion surrounding the potential AI bubble reflected various perspectives on the current investment climate and technological viability in the AI sector. Many commenters expressed skepticism about the sustainability of massive investments given the disparity between soaring expenditures and projected revenues. Some suggested that the expectations from AI technologies are inflated and might not manifest into profitable business models anytime soon.

Several users likened current trends to previous tech bubbles, questioning whether the excitement around AI is justified considering historical investment patterns in technology. The conversation highlighted the notion that while AI holds potential, it may not yet offer sufficient returns, with warnings about overreliance on speculative investments without adequate grounding in actual revenue generation.

Others believed that despite possible short-term bubbles, the underlying technology would eventually yield significant breakthroughs and companies that successfully integrate AI solutions could thrive, eventually generating substantial revenue. Contrasting the current excitement with past tech disruptions, opinion varied on whether the current levels of funding and hype would lead to a similar successful outcome or a regrettable market correction.

The dialogue exhibited a broad spectrum of opinions, from those cautious about the future of investments in AI to those optimistic about its transformative potential, indicating a complex and uncertain landscape as stakeholders navigate the promises and pitfalls of AI technology.
