### Reducing Raspberry Pi 5's power consumption by 140x

#### [Submission URL](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2023/reducing-raspberry-pi-5s-power-consumption-140x) | 49 points | by [tambourine_man](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tambourine_man) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38155559)

The Raspberry Pi 5 consumes a significant amount of power even when shut down, but a user on Hacker News has found a way to reduce its power consumption by 140 times. By default, the Pi 5 leaves its system-on-a-chip (SoC) powered up in a shutdown state, resulting in a power consumption of 1.2-1.6W. This is due to certain HATs having trouble if the 3v3 power rail is off while the 5v power supply is still active. To fix this issue, the user recommends editing the EEPROM config by setting POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1. Rebooting after this configuration change will reduce the Pi's power consumption to 0.01W or even less when shut down. The user also suggests that it would be beneficial for the default setting to be changed, possibly by either identifying HATs that don't work properly with 5V and without 3v3 or finding a solution that allows everyone to default to POWER_OFF_ON_HALT=1. Overall, the fix seems simple and effective, enabling a significant reduction in power consumption for Raspberry Pi 5 users.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the power consumption of the Raspberry Pi 5 and the recommended fix provided by a user. Here are the key points raised in the comments:

- Some users express frustration with clickbait-style titles, suggesting that they tend to not click on such articles or engage in the discussion.
- Others find the discussion relevant and highlight the importance of reducing power consumption, particularly for low-power applications and practical purposes.
- One user mentions that people often underestimate the power draw of Raspberry Pi and need to consider more efficient alternatives.
- Another user shares that the Raspberry Pi 5 consumes around 1.2-1.6W even when shut down, attributing it to certain HATs struggling with the 5V power supply being active while the 3v3 power rail is off.
- A user suggests that a hardware solution could be to identify HATs that don't work properly without 3v3 power or find a way for everyone to default to the recommended configuration change.
- An individual questions the mathematical accuracy of the claim that the fix reduces power consumption by 140 times.
- The discussion generally focuses on the technical aspects and implications of the power consumption issue rather than engaging in broader conversation.

In a world filled with cameras, science fiction is becoming reality. With the rise of cheap, mobile technology, everyone has become a watcher, capturing and sharing moments from the mundane to the hyper-dramatic. This includes not only individuals but also the police, with their actions being recorded by anyone with a camera phone. While this can lead to increased accountability and improved safety, it also raises concerns about privacy and abuse. There are currently 245 million surveillance cameras installed worldwide, and that number is growing by 15% each year. As surveillance technologies continue to evolve, cutting-edge ideas such as a camera small enough to fit on a contact lens and a throwable camera shaped like a ball are hitting the market. AI is also being utilized to sift through the massive volumes of video data that are being collected, with the goal of recognizing specific events and anomalies in real-time. However, there is a need for social norms and legal structures to be developed to ensure that the use of cameras is symmetrical and that there is accountability for those who are watching and being watched.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to constant monitoring and surveillance. Some commenters express concerns about the invasive nature of monitoring and the potential abuse of such technology. Others highlight the benefits of surveillance for safety and accountability. There are discussions about the impact of surveillance on privacy, the role of AI in analyzing video data, and the need for legal and social norms to govern the use of cameras. Some commenters draw parallels to dystopian literature like Orwell's Big Brother and the Chinese surveillance state. The discussion also touches on topics like the impact of surveillance on medical diagnoses, the potential for self-censorship, and the practicality of continuous recording.
