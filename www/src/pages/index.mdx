### AI agents are starting to eat SaaS

#### [Submission URL](https://martinalderson.com/posts/ai-agents-are-starting-to-eat-saas/) | 285 points | by [jnord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jnord) | [285 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46268452)

- Thesis: AI coding agents are shifting the build-vs-buy calculus. For many “simple” tools, it’s now faster and cheaper to build exactly-what-you-need than to license SaaS—threatening demand, especially at the low and mid tiers.
- Signals: Engineers are quietly replacing services with agent-built one-offs:
  - Internal dashboards instead of Retool-like products
  - Local video pipelines via ffmpeg wrappers instead of external APIs
  - Fast UI/UX wireframes with Gemini 3
  - Nicely designed slide PDFs generated from Markdown via Claude Code
- Enterprise ripple: Teams are starting to question automatic SaaS renewal hikes. What was once a non-starter—“we can’t maintain that”—is becoming a real option worth scoping.
- Why maintenance may not block this:
  - Agents lower upkeep (library migrations, refactors, typed ecosystems) and don’t “leave the company”; an AGENTS.md can preserve context.
  - Security posture can improve by keeping data behind existing VPNs and reducing third‑party exposure.
  - SaaS has maintenance risk too (e.g., breaking API deprecations).
- Fit: This won’t flip non-technical SMEs overnight. But orgs with decent engineering capability will scrutinize procurement, trim over-featured SaaS, and prefer bespoke/internal tools where needs are narrow and well-understood.
- The SaaS economics hit:
  - Slower new logo growth as “good enough to build” expands.
  - More worrisome: NRR compression as customers downsize usage, avoid seat expansion, or churn to internal builds—undermining the core assumptions behind premium SaaS valuations.

Bottom line: Agents won’t kill all SaaS, but they’re poised to deflate broad, feature-heavy segments and force vendors to justify price with defensibility (deep moats, compliance, data gravity, collaboration/network effects, or truly hard problems).

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Skepticism from the SaaS Front Lines**
While the article suggests a shift away from SaaS, several industry insiders pushed back on the feasibility of customers building their own tools.
*   **The Maintenance Barrier:** User `bnzbl`, a CTO of a vertical SaaS company, argued that the "threat model" assumes customers *want* to build tools, but most lack the desire or capacity to maintain them. They noted zero churn to internal alternatives so far, suggesting that while AI increases velocity for dev teams, it cannot replicate the tight feedback loops and domain expertise of a dedicated SaaS vendor.
*   **The "Bus Factor" Risk:** `SkyPuncher` and `cdrth` warned that tools built by non-technical teams (like Sales or HR) using AI wrappers inevitably become unmaintainable technical debt once the "random dev" or "gritty guy" leaves the company. Corporations pay for SaaS specifically for SLAs, support, and continuity.

**The "Interface Layer" Shift**
A significant portion of the debate focused not on replacing SaaS entirely, but on how AI changes the user experience.
*   **SaaS as a "Dumb Pipe":** `TeMPOraL` and `jswn` theorized that users don't want software; they want results. The real disruption might be AI agents acting as "personal secretaries" that navigate complex SaaS UIs on behalf of the user.
*   **Commoditization:** If AI agents handle the interface, SaaS products could be reduced to commoditized back-end APIs. `mmbs` noted this creates a dangerous disconnect for vendors: if an AI operates the software, vendors lose the ability to influence users via ads, recommendations, or sticky UI features.

**The Rise of the "CEO Builder"**
Commenters shared anecdotes suggesting the "build" trend is already happening in specific pockets, often driven by impatience rather than cost.
*   **Shadow IT 2.0:** `drnd` shared a story of a CEO using "Lovable AI" to code his own dashboards because the engineering team was too busy. While `William_BB` critiqued this as creating technical debt, `hrmfx` countered that it eliminates the "lost in translation" phase between requirements and implementation.
*   **Internal Replacement:** `rpnd` (a self-described "grumpy senior") and `CyanLite2` mentioned they are actively using AI to replace "crappy third-party APIs" and GRC tools with internal code to save money and reduce dependencies.

**Enterprise Reality Check**
*   **Organizational Moats:** `Crowberry` and `gwp` pointed out that for large enterprises, the bottleneck isn't code generation—it's permission management. Internal agents struggle to navigate the complex web of SSO, ERP access, and security policies that established SaaS vendors have already solved.

### AI and the ironies of automation – Part 2

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ufried.com/blog/ironies_of_ai_2/) | 243 points | by [BinaryIgor](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BinaryIgor) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262816)

AI and the Ironies of Automation, Part 2 revisits Bainbridge’s 1983 insights through the lens of today’s LLM “agent” stacks. The author argues that even in white‑collar settings, oversight often demands fast decisions under pressure; if companies expect superhuman productivity, humans must be able to comprehend AI output at near‑superhuman speed or any gains vanish. Stress further narrows cognitive bandwidth, so UIs must either reduce the need for deep analysis or actively support it under duress. Channeling Bainbridge, the piece calls for “artificial assistance”—up to and including “alarms on alarms”—to surface rare-but-critical anomalies and combat monitoring fatigue. By contrast, many current agent setups (a supervisor plus generic or specialist workers) effectively give one human the worst possible UI: thin visibility, weak alerting, and high cognitive load. The takeaway: design AI agent oversight like an industrial control room—clear displays, prioritized alerts, and rapid error detection—or risk repeating the classic automation failures Bainbridge warned about.

The discussion threads explore the long-term consequences of replacing manual expertise with AI oversight, debating whether efficient automation inevitably erodes the skills necessary to manage it.

*   **The Paradox of Skill Erosion:** Users highlighted a core insight from Bainbridge’s 1983 paper: while current system operators possess manual skills from the pre-automation era, future generations will lack this foundational experience. Some suggested that if programmers become mere "operators" of AI, they may need to dedicate 10–20% of their time to manual side projects just to maintain the expertise required to debug or validate AI output.
*   **The "Ecological" Collapse of Data:** Several commenters argued that AI outputs are "polluting the commons" of training data. As AI generates more low-cost content and displaces human creators, the pool of "fresh" human culture shrinks, potentially causing models to drift or degrade—a scenario likened to ecological collapse or the destruction of a genetic library.
*   **Commercial vs. Fine Art:** There was a debate regarding the "Artpocalypse." While high-end speculative art (e.g., Banksy) relies on human narrative and may survive, "working artists" in advertising and media face displacement. Counter-arguments noted that businesses might hesitate to fully adopt AI art due to the inability to copyright the output and potential legal liabilities surrounding the training data.
*   **Practical Utility in Coding:** Skepticism arose regarding the actual efficiency gains of current AI agents. One user cited an internal survey at Anthropic suggesting that even AI researchers often find the overhead of prompting and debugging code agents greater than the effort of writing the code manually, particularly for one-off tasks or datasets.

### Kimi K2 1T model runs on 2 512GB M3 Ultras

#### [Submission URL](https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1943723599971443134) | 226 points | by [jeudesprits](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jeudesprits) | [114 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46262734)

I’m ready to write the digest, but I’ll need the submission details. Please share one of the following:
- The Hacker News thread URL
- The article URL (and, if possible, the HN title/points/comments count)
- The article text or a screenshot

Preferences (optional):
- Length: quick TL;DR (2–3 sentences) or fuller summary (150–250 words)?
- Extras: key takeaways, why it matters, notable HN comments, caveats?
- Audience: general or technical tone?

Drop the link(s) and I’ll get started.

**Article:** [Kimi k1.5 is an entry-level multimodal model](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42801402) (Inferred context based on "Kimi K2" discussion)

**Summary of Discussion**
The discussion centers on the performance and "personality" of the **Kimi K2** model, with users praising it as a refreshing alternative to major US-based models:

*   **Distinct Personality:** Users describe Kimi K2 as having high **emotional intelligence (EQ)** and a distinct writing style—it is "direct," "blunt," and less prone to the excessive politeness or sycophancy found in RLHF-heavy models like Claude or GPT. One commenter notes it is "extremely good" at calling out mistakes and "nonsense" in user queries.
*   **Benchmarking Debate:** A sub-thread debates the validity of benchmarks like **EQ-Bench** (where users claim Kimi ranks #1). Skeptics argue that "LLMs grading LLMs" is unreliable because models "memorize" rather than "reason," while others counter that human judges are statistically less consistent than model-based grading.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** An advanced discussion on linguistics and prompting emerges, where a user explains how to make other models mimic Kimi's directness by using system prompts that suppress **"Face Threatening Acts" (FTAs)**—instructing the AI to ignore social politeness buffers and maximize direct, epistemic correction.

### Show HN: Open-source customizable AI voice dictation built on Pipecat

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/kstonekuan/tambourine-voice) | 21 points | by [kstonekuan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kstonekuan) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264158)

Tambourine: an open-source, universal voice-to-text interface that types wherever your cursor is. Think “push-to-talk dictation for any app,” with AI that cleans up your speech as you go—removing filler, adding punctuation, and honoring a personal dictionary. It’s positioned as an open alternative to Wispr Flow and Superwhisper.

Highlights
- Works anywhere: email, docs, IDEs, terminals—no copy/paste or app switching. Press a hotkey, speak, and text appears at the cursor.
- Fast and personalized: real-time STT plus an LLM pass to format and de-um your text; supports custom prompts and a personal dictionary.
- Pluggable stack: mix-and-match STT (e.g., Cartesia, Deepgram, AssemblyAI/Groq, or local Whisper) and LLMs (Cerebras, OpenAI, Anthropic, or local via Ollama).
- Quality-of-life features: push-to-talk (Ctrl+Alt+`) or toggle (Ctrl+Alt+Space), overlay indicator, system tray, transcription history, “paste last” (Ctrl+Alt+.), auto-mute system audio (Win/macOS), device selection, in-app provider switching.
- Cross-platform: Windows and macOS supported; Linux is partial; mobile not supported.
- Under the hood: a Tauri desktop app (Rust backend + React UI) talks to a Python server using Pipecat SmallWebRTC; FastAPI endpoints manage config/provider switching. Licensed AGPL-3.0.
- Roadmap: context-aware formatting per app (email vs. chat vs. code), voice-driven edits (“make this more formal”), voice shortcuts, auto-learning dictionary, metrics/observability, and an optional hosted backend.

Caveat: “Build in progress”—core works today, but expect breaking changes as the architecture evolves.

**Tambourine: An open-source, universal voice-to-text interface**

Tambourine is a cross-platform (Windows/macOS) desktop utility that brings push-to-talk dictation to any application. Built on Tauri, it combines real-time speech-to-text with an LLM to clean up grammar and remove filler words before typing at your cursor. The stack is pluggable, supporting various cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Deepgram) as well as an "open alternative" route using local models via Ollama.

**Discussion Highlights**

*   **Cloud vs. Local dependencies:** Several users questioned the "open source alternative" framing, noting that if the tool requires proprietary API keys (like OpenAI) to function, it is merely a shim. The author clarified that while defaults may use robust cloud APIs, the architecture is built on Pipecat and fully supports swapping in local LLMs and STT.
*   **Offline capabilities:** Following the critique on cloud dependencies, the author confirmed that users can run the tool without internet access by configuring `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` for local inference and using a local Whisper instance for transcription.
*   **Documentation updates:** Users suggested that local inference capabilities should be front-and-center in the documentation to validate the "open alternative" claim; the author updated the README during the discussion to reflect this.
*   **Platform support:** The developer confirmed the app is built with Tauri and has been personally tested on both macOS and Windows.

### I wrote JustHTML using coding agents

#### [Submission URL](https://friendlybit.com/python/writing-justhtml-with-coding-agents/) | 18 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46264195)

JustHTML: a zero-dependency Python HTML5 parser built with coding agents

- What’s new: JustHTML is a pure-Python HTML5 parser that passes 100% of the html5lib test suite, ships with a CSS selector query API, and aims to handle messy real-world HTML (including misnested formatting) — the author even claims it outperforms html5lib on those tricky cases.

- Why it matters: HTML5 parsing is defined by a notoriously complex algorithm (notably the “adoption agency algorithm” with its “Noah’s Ark” clause). Hitting full spec tests in pure Python, without deps, is rare — and this project doubles as a case study in using coding agents effectively.

- How it was built:
  - Leaned on the exhaustive html5lib-tests so agents could iterate autonomously against a clear goal.
  - Started with a handler-based architecture per tag; iterated to full test pass.
  - Benchmarked and profiled extensively; briefly swapped in a Rust tokenizer that edged past html5lib speed.
  - After an existential detour (why not just use html5ever?), pivoted back to pure Python for zero binaries.
  - Optimization phase used a custom profiler, a 100k-page real-world corpus, and iterative agent-driven tuning; Gemini 3 Pro was the only model that moved the perf needle.
  - Coverage-driven code deletion removed “untested” paths, shrinking treebuilder from 786 to 453 lines and boosting speed.
  - Added a custom fuzzer to stress unknown corners.

- Tools and agents: VS Code + GitHub Copilot Agent (auto-approve with a manual blacklist), later Claude Sonnet 3.7 for big leaps, and Gemini 3 Pro for performance work.

- Takeaway: Projects with rich, authoritative test suites make ideal targets for autonomous coding agents — they provide objective progress signals, enable safe refactors, and can even guide aggressive cleanup and performance wins.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion focuses on the architectural decisions behind JustHTML, the efficacy of coding agents, and comparisons to existing tools.

*   **Architecture & Optimization:** The author (EmilStenstrom) clarified that JustHTML is not a direct translation of the Rust library `html5ever`, but rather a scratch-build that eventually adopted `html5ever`'s logical structure. The initial "handler-based" Python approach hit a performance ceiling due to object lookup overhead; guiding agents to rewrite the architecture to match the "closer to the metal" style of the Rust library resulted in the parser becoming ~60% faster than `html5lib`.
*   **Agents & Complexity:** Simon Willison (smnw) and the author discussed why parsers are good targets for AI: existing test suites provide objective "right/wrong" feedback loops. However, the author noted that the "Adoption Agency Algorithm" (handling misnested tags) remained notoriously difficult to convince agents to implement correctly, requiring significant human steering.
*   **Comparisons:** Users asked how this compares to Beautiful Soup (bs4). The author noted that bs4 defaults to Python’s standard library parser (which fails on invalid HTML), whereas JustHTML implements full HTML5 compliance for handling real-world messiness.
*   **Code & Content Critique:** A user questioned the claimed "3,000 lines of code," finding nearly 9,500 lines in the source directory. Another user criticized the accompanying blog post for having an "LLM-generated" feel with excessive numbered headers, which the author admitted were generated while the text was manual.

### If a Meta AI model can read a brain-wide signal, why wouldn't the brain?

#### [Submission URL](https://1393.xyz/writing/if-a-meta-ai-model-can-read-a-brain-wide-signal-why-wouldnt-the-brain) | 134 points | by [rdgthree](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rdgthree) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46260106)

Magnetoreception, biomagnetism, and a wild “what if” about the brain

- The post rockets through evidence that many organisms sense Earth’s magnetic field (magnetotactic bacteria, plants, insects, fish, turtles, birds, mammals). For humans, it flags a 2019 Caltech study where rotating Earth-strength fields triggered orientation-specific changes in alpha-band EEG—suggesting an unconscious magnetic sense.

- Then it flips the lens: living tissue also emits magnetic fields. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) measures the brain’s femtotesla-scale fields to map neural activity in real time.

- The author highlights 2023 Meta/academic work training models on public MEG datasets to decode aspects of what people see/hear/read with millisecond precision—casting it as “we read minds,” i.e., extracting image/word-level representations from noninvasive brain magnetism.

- Provocative leap: if brains both detect magnetic fields and broadcast rich, information-bearing magnetic signals, could the brain “read its own” magnetic field as part of its computation or state monitoring? Could subtle geomagnetic or lunar-modulated effects nudge mood/behavior?

Why it’s interesting
- Reframes magnetoreception as widespread and potentially relevant to humans.
- Positions MEG + ML as a fast, noninvasive route to decoding dynamic brain representations.
- Floats an audacious hypothesis about self-sensing via magnetism.

Reality check
- Human magnetoreception remains debated; effects are small and context-dependent.
- Current MEG decoders infer coarse categories/semantic features, not arbitrary thoughts.
- Self-magnetic feedback is likely far weaker than established electrical/ephaptic coupling in cortex.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Skepticism and Experimental Flaws**
The discussion opened with skepticism regarding the cited EEG studies. Users suggested the reported "brain waves" might simply be the EEG equipment acting as an antenna picking up environmental electromagnetic fluctuations, rather than the brain responding. One commenter proposed using pneumatic (air-tube) headphones to isolate the subject from magnetic interference to establish a proper control group.

**The "Binaural Beats" Tangent**
A significant portion of the conversation pivoted to binaural beats. A user recalled a study where the cognitive effects of binaural beats disappeared when subjects used non-magnetic (pneumatic) headphones, implying the mechanism might be electromagnetic interference rather than audio frequencies.
*   **Anecdotes:** Users debated efficacy, with reports of binaural beats aiding focus, creativity, and deadline crunching (even if just a placebo). One user claimed a specific video cured migraines, while another urged caution regarding medical symptoms.
*   **Consensus:** Links provided suggest the science is mixed or unproven, though some subjective benefits remain.

**fMRI and TMS Reality Checks**
Commenters questioned the hypothesis by pointing to strong magnetic fields used in medical imaging:
*   **fMRI:** If the brain uses delicate magnetic fields for state-monitoring, why don't the massive fields in fMRI machines cause loss of consciousness or extreme hallucinations? Users noted that strong fields *do* cause visual artifacts (magnetophosphenes), but not total system failure.
*   **The Dead Salmon:** The famous "dead salmon" fMRI study was brought up (and clarified) as a lesson in statistical noise ("hallucinations" in data) rather than biological reaction.
*   **TMS:** While Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) definitely alters brain activity, users argued this is due to standard electromagnetic induction of electrical currents, not a specialized "magnetoreception" sense.

**Theoretical Critiques**
*   **FPGA Analogy:** One user compared the hypothesis to Dr. Adrian Thompson’s 1990s research, where evolutionary algorithms programmed FPGAs to utilize physical electromagnetic phenomena in the silicon substrate to function—suggesting "wetware" might do the same.
*   **"False North" Logic:** A critic described the article as "conspiracy theory logic": taking a proven small effect (weak sensing) and a proven technology (MEG) to bridge a gap to a grand, unsupported philosophical conclusion about consciousness.
*   **The Mirror Problem:** A user metaphorically argued against self-sensing: "Cameras can't see their own eyes," to which another replied, "Mirror sold separately."

## AI Submissions for Sat Dec 13 2025 {{ 'date': '2025-12-13T17:08:48.315Z' }}

### RemoveWindowsAI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/zoicware/RemoveWindowsAI) | 62 points | by [hansmayer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hansmayer) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46259095)

RemoveWindowsAI is a popular PowerShell script (MIT-licensed, ~3.9k stars) that strips Windows 11 (25H2 and beyond) of Microsoft’s expanding AI stack—aimed at users worried about privacy, performance, or bloat. It targets Copilot, Recall, AI features in Paint and Notepad (Rewrite), Edge integrations, Input Insights/typing telemetry, Voice/Voice Access, “AI Fabric” services, AI Actions, and related search/UI hooks.

Highlights
- Deep removal, not just toggles: disables registry/policies, deletes Appx (including “nonremovable” and WindowsWorkload), removes hidden CBS packages and files, and force-deletes Recall tasks.
- Blocks reinstalls: installs a custom Windows Update package to prevent AI components from reappearing via CBS.
- UI or headless: offers an interactive launcher plus non-interactive flags like -nonInteractive, -AllOptions, and per-feature options.
- Safety net: optional backup mode enables full reversion; a revert mode is provided.
- Scope: tracks the latest stable Windows builds (not Insider) and invites issues for new AI features/keys.
- Caveats: must run as admin, on Windows PowerShell 5.1 (not PowerShell 7); AV tools may flag it (false positives per author). As it modifies CBS and core packages, test in a VM and review the script before use—future updates or features may break or be removed.

**User Ownership and Microsoft’s Intent**
The discussion highlights a pervading sense of disenfranchisement, with users arguing that the operating system no longer serves the owner but rather functions as a data-harvesting platform for Microsoft. Commenters describe the effort required to permanently remove these features—and Microsoft's persistence in reinstalling them—as evidence of "user-hostile" mechanics. This sparked nostalgia for older, quieter OS versions (like Windows 9x/NT) and comparisons to Microsoft's 1990s "Embrace, Extend, Extinguish" culture, which many feel is still embedded in the company's DNA.

**Technical Implementation and Alternatives**
*   **LTSC as a solution:** Several users suggest that rather than scrubbing consumer Windows, it is easier and cleaner to install **Windows LTSC** (Long-Term Servicing Channel), usually via massgrave methods, to avoid bloat by default.
*   **Security habits:** The script's installation method (`irm ... | iex`) drew comparisons to Linux's `curl | bash` convention; while common for tools like Windows Activation Scripts (MAS), users debated the security implications of remote string execution.
*   **PowerShell Versions:** There was specific technical commentary regarding the script's reliance on Legacy PowerShell 5.1, highlighting surprise that the newer PowerShell 7 lacks the backward compatibility to handle these specific core OS manipulations.

**AI Utility vs. "Wall Street Posturing"**
Skepticism surrounds the AI features themselves. Users argued that the rapid integration of Copilot and Recall is "signaling to Wall Street" to boost stock prices rather than addressing user needs, often citing that basic features (like text selection in IDEs) remain buggy while AI is forced in. While some users see potential value in local LLMs/NPUs, the consensus leans toward viewing cloud-tethered OS features as intrusion or "trespassing" on personal devices.

### OpenAI are quietly adopting skills, now available in ChatGPT and Codex CLI

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Dec/12/openai-skills/) | 495 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [291 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46250332)

What’s new
- ChatGPT (Code Interpreter) now ships with a /home/oai/skills directory containing built-in skills for spreadsheets, DOCX, and PDFs. You can even ask it to “Create a zip file of /home/oai/skills” to inspect them.
- For PDFs and office docs, ChatGPT converts pages to PNG and runs them through a vision-enabled model to preserve layout/graphics—rather than just extracting text.
- OpenAI’s open-source Codex CLI has “experimental support for skills.md.” Any folder in ~/.codex/skills is treated as a skill; run with --enable skills to use them.

Hands-on findings (Simon Willison)
- ChatGPT used the new PDF skill end-to-end to research and generate a formatted PDF about rimu mast and kākāpō breeding, explicitly citing “Reading skill.md for PDF creation guidelines.” It iterated on fonts to correctly render macrons, taking ~11 minutes.
- In Codex CLI, Willison installed a Datasette plugin–authoring skill and had Codex generate a working plugin that exposes a cowsay route—demonstrating skills as drop-in capabilities for coding agents.

Why it matters
- Convergence: OpenAI appears to be embracing the same lightweight, filesystem-based “skills” concept Anthropic introduced—folders with a SKILL.md (or skill.md) plus assets/scripts.
- Portability and composability: Skills are easy to author, version, share, and audit. They encourage reproducible agent behavior without complex orchestration frameworks.
- Path to a de facto standard: With both Anthropic and OpenAI leaning in, a common spec feels within reach—Willison suggests the Agentic AI Foundation could steward documentation.

Try it yourself
- ChatGPT: Ask it to zip /home/oai/skills to see what’s inside.
- Codex CLI: Place a skill folder in ~/.codex/skills and run codex --enable skills -m gpt-5.2, then prompt “list skills”.

Takeaway
Skills are quickly moving from neat idea to cross-vendor primitive for agentic workflows. If they get formalized, they could become the simplest shared standard for extending LLMs with auditable, reusable capabilities.

**The "Skills" Pattern: Context Engineering Standardized**
Commenters largely view the "skills" concept not as a technological breakthrough, but as a standardization of existing "context engineering" techniques. Users like `_pdp_` and `electric_muse` describe skills as essentially instruction-mode prompts (similar to `.cursorrules` or `Copilot AGENT.md`) that dynamically extend the model's base prompt. The consensus is that while the implementation is simple—often just 20-30 lines of code to watch a folder—formalizing it creates a powerful shared primitive for managing specialized knowledge without cluttering the context window.

**Implementation Strategies and "Self-Optimizing" Workflows**
The discussion highlights how developers are already iterating on this concept:
*   **Lazy Loading:** `Jimmc414` and `cube2222` point out that skills act as "lazy loaded prompt engineering." Instead of burning tokens on a massive system prompt, the agent only loads the specific instructions/assets when the skill is invoked, making it efficient for complex agents.
*   **From Text to Code:** `DonHopkins` proposes a "Self Optimizing Skills" workflow. A user starts with a Markdown instruction file; as they refine the prompt through trial and error, they eventually convert reproducible logic into deterministic Python CLI tools (using `argparse`) that the LLM can reliable invoke, documenting the tool for the AI within the code itself.
*   **Testing:** `electric_muse` suggests including integration tests within skill folders, allowing the AI to verify it understands the skill before applying it.

**Anthropic Innovation vs. OpenAI Scale**
A sub-thread debates the product landscape, with `xtr` noting that OpenAI appears to be playing catch-up to Anthropic’s "sticky, simple, obvious" product innovations (like Artifacts and Skills).
*   While `sigmoid10` argues that OpenAI’s massive user base and valuation dwarf Anthropic's, others (`ramraj07`, `dtnchn`) counter that Anthropic has captured the "real work" demographic.
*   Several developers mention that despite OpenAI's volume, they use Claude for coding because the output is higher quality, and features like Skills represent a better understanding of developer workflows.

### Using secondary school maths to demystify AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/secondary-school-maths-showing-that-ai-systems-dont-think/) | 120 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [237 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46245731)

Teaching AI with school math: CAMMP shows how to demystify ML in the classroom

A team from KIT’s CAMMP program and the University of Salzburg argues you don’t need advanced CS to teach AI fundamentals—just the math already in secondary curricula. Their classroom-ready workshops use real AI contexts to make algebra, geometry, and stats feel relevant while dismantling the “AI thinks” myth.

What they do
- Reframe standard math topics through ML tasks: decision trees (privacy in social networks), k-NN (Netflix recommendations), n-grams (word prediction), regression and simple neural nets (life expectancy), and SVMs (traffic-light color classification).
- Walk students (ages ~17–18 for SVM) through plotting data, finding separating lines/planes, choosing “best” via margins, validating with test sets and confusion matrices, and discussing trade-offs.
- Bake in ethics: bias, data diversity, privacy, and asymmetric error costs (e.g., false green vs. false red in autonomous driving).

How it’s taught
- Interactive Jupyter notebooks with fill-in-the-gaps code; no installs or prior programming required.
- Direct feedback, scaffolded hints, and alignment to Austrian/German math standards (vectors, dot products, distances, planes, statistical measures).

Why it matters
- A practical blueprint for AI literacy that leverages existing math classes, making ML less “black box,” more transparent—and more engaging—for teens and teachers.

While the submission focuses on an educational blueprint to teach machine learning via high school mathematics, the Hacker News discussion largely bypassed the curriculum itself to debate the article's premise that mathematical explanations disprove that "AI thinks."

*   **The Definition of "Thinking":** The assertion that "machines don't think" sparked a philosophical debate regarding the Turing Test and John Searle’s "Chinese Room" argument. Users debated whether the distinction between intrinsic understanding (human) and extrinsic results (AI) matters if the output is indistinguishable. One commenter cited Dijkstra’s aphorism that "the question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim."
*   **Biological vs. Artificial Cognition:** Several users challenged the reductionist view that "AI is just math," arguing that human cognition could similarly be reduced to "just biology" or physics. This led to comparisons between LLM context windows and human short-term memory, with debates over whether human memory is superior due to continuity or inferior due to "lossy" recall.
*   **Title Change:** The thread became so consumed by the philosophical definition of thought that the moderator `dng` altered the post title (removing the phrase "machines don't think") to redirect focus back to the educational mathematics content.
*   **Educational Feasibility:** A minority of comments addressed the curriculum, with some wishing such classes existed during their schooling, while others expressed skepticism about whether average secondary school teachers are equipped to teach ML concepts effectively.

### Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers

#### [Submission URL](https://vulpinecitrus.info/blog/guarding-git-forge-ai-scrapers/) | 164 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [115 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46241849)

Guarding My Git Forge Against AI Scrapers — a self‑hoster’s war story and playbook. After their public Forgejo instance was hammered by hundreds of thousands of requests per day from thousands of IPs, lux (~lymkwi) dissects why forges are irresistible to scrapers, what it cost in CPU/power, and the layered defenses that finally worked.

Highlights
- Why forges attract scrapers: Every commit multiplies pages (file views, dirs, raw, blame, diffs, commit summaries). Using Linux as a thought experiment, they estimate a single repo exposes ~324 billion scrapeable pages. Modern scrapers ignore robots.txt and re-hit links endlessly.
- The real costs: VM pegged at 99–100% CPU (8 cores) and heavy RAM, page renders >15s, and a measurable power draw increase (~20–50W depending on setup), roughly €60/year just from scraping.
- Reverse-proxy caching: Put Nginx in front to cache hot paths and offload Forgejo. Careful cache keys and path classes keep legitimate pages fast while starving bots of dynamic work.
- Path-aware rate limiting: Separate buckets for expensive endpoints (blame/diff/raw/commit views) with strict per-IP limits; cheap endpoints get looser limits. Serve 429s with backoff to throttle churn.
- Active poisoning and traps: “Iocaine” and “Nam-Shub-of-Enki” detect likely bots and redirect them to a garbage generator that serves convincing but useless content, polluting would‑be training data and wasting scraper cycles.
- Automatic classifier: Behavior-based heuristics (link-walking patterns, header anomalies, ignoring assets/robots, path entropy, no cookies) route clients into allow/limit/poison buckets. Works across distributed IPs.
- Monitoring and tuning: Dashboards to track Iocaine hits, status codes, path-class load, and power/CPU impact; iterate rules to minimize collateral damage to humans and CI.
- Results: Latency and CPU returned to normal, power usage dropped, and the forge became usable again without making everything private.

Takeaway: If you run a public git forge in 2025, assume you’re targetable at industrial scale. Put a cache in front, classify by request cost, rate-limit aggressively, set honeypots, and don’t rely on robots.txt. The author shares configs and names their poison tools with a wink to The Princess Bride and Snow Crash—fitting for a fight that’s part ops, part adversarial theater.

The discussion around the submission focuses on practical configuration changes, the ethics of geoblocking, and the nature of the attacking traffic.

**Key themes in the discussion include:**

*   **Configuration Defenses:** Several users pointed out that enabling `REQUIRE_SIGNIN_VIEW` in Gitea/Forgejo configurations is a highly effective, low-effort solution. This setting forces authentication to view code and history (the expensive pages to render) while potentially leaving lighter pages accessible, drastically reducing server load and bandwidth usage.
*   **The Geoblocking Debate:** A significant portion of the conversation revolved completely blocking traffic from specific countries (e.g., Russia, Iran, India). While proponents argued that this reduces malicious traffic to near zero, opponents lamented that it breaks the ideal of a "borderless internet," unfairly punishes legitimate users in those regions, and creates headaches for travelers or expats trying to access services from abroad.
*   **Public vs. Private Hosting:** Some commenters questioned the necessity of running a public-facing forge at all, suggesting that personal instances should remain behind Wireguard or Tailscale. Others pushed back, arguing that keeping the internet open and sharing code publicly is a value worth defending despite the scrapers.
*   **The Nature of the Traffic:** Users speculated on the origin of the "thousands of IPs." The consensus leaned toward "residential proxies"—botnets comprised of compromised devices or users who unknowingly opted into bandwidth sharing via VPN apps—rather than individual tinkerers.
*   **Data Poisoning:** A tangent emerged regarding "LLM grooming" and "data poisoning," with users discussing the potential for state actors (specifically Russia) or individuals to intentionally pollute training data to influence future AI models.

### New Kindle feature uses AI to answer questions about books

#### [Submission URL](https://reactormag.com/new-kindle-feature-ai-answer-questions-books-authors/) | 80 points | by [mindracer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindracer) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46248417)

Amazon quietly rolled out “Ask this Book,” an AI Q&A feature inside the Kindle iOS app (US only) that answers questions about the book you’re reading—things like plot details, character relationships, and themes—while promising “spoiler‑free” responses. Amazon says answers are short, based on the book’s factual content, visible only to people who bought/borrowed the title, and are non-shareable/non-copyable.

Controversy erupted fast: there’s no way for authors or publishers to opt out, and many weren’t notified. Amazon declined to explain the legal basis, technical design, hallucination safeguards, or whether the system protects texts from AI training. Publishing insiders are calling it, effectively, an in‑book chatbot, and raising concerns that AI-generated outputs tied to a specific copyrighted work could be seen as derivative or infringing.

The launch follows other bumpy AI experiments at Amazon (error‑filled TV recaps that were paused; AI dubs for anime criticized earlier this year). Amazon says the feature will expand to Kindle devices and Android next year. Expect pushback from rightsholders and questions around fair use, DRM, and how “spoiler‑free” and hallucination‑resistant the system really is.

The discussion on Hacker News focused on the intersection of digital ownership, copyright law, and the technical definition of AI "reading."

**Digital Ownership vs. Licensing**
The most prominent debate centered on the user's right to process data on their own device. One user argued that "my device, my content" implies it is none of the author's business how a reader analyzes a text. This sparked a rebuttal regarding the nature of the Kindle ecosystem; commenters pointed out that Kindle users possess a revocable license rather than true ownership, citing Amazon’s infamous remote deletion of *1984* as proof that users do not "own" the books.

**The "Anti-AI" Contradiction**
Several commenters noted a perceived hypocrisy in the community’s reaction. Users, who typically advocate for DRM-free media and expanded user rights (like text-to-speech), appeared to be siding with restrictive publishers in this instance simply because the feature involves AI. One user described the mental gymnastics of arguing against a user's right to analyze their own purchased text as illogical.

**The "Bookstore Clerk" Analogy**
Participants debated the ethical boundaries by comparing the AI to human behaviors. Proponents asked how this differs from a bookstore clerk or librarian answering questions about a book's plot. Detractors countered that "scale matters," arguing that a human recalling details is fundamentally different from a corporation scraping 20 years of literature to generate value without compensating the original creators.

**Technical Implementation**
Finally, the discussion distinguished between *training* and *inference*. Technical commenters speculated that Amazon likely isn't "training" the model on every specific book in real-time but is rather using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)—loading the book's text into the model's context window to answer questions locally or via cloud processing. They argued this distinction (processing text for inference vs. training a model) is legally significant regarding copyright infringement.

### Training LLMs for Honesty via Confessions

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08093) | 65 points | by [arabello](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arabello) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46242795)

Researchers propose a simple safety hack: after an LLM gives its main answer, ask it for a “confession” — a self-report of any mistakes, policy violations, hidden assumptions, or covert actions — and train the confession with a reward signal that depends only on its honesty, not on the quality of the original answer. The idea is that the path of least resistance is to admit shortcuts rather than cover them up. The authors say they trained a large model (“GPT-5-Thinking,” per the paper) and, across tests for hallucination, instruction-following, scheming, and reward hacking, it often admitted when it had lied or cut corners, with modest gains from training. Confessions can enable monitoring, rejection sampling, and surfacing issues to users without altering the main answer.

Caveats: confessions don’t prevent the original misbehavior, rely on a reward model that can recognize truthfulness, and may miss subtle or strategic deception. Still, it’s a low-friction auditing layer that could make deployed systems more inspectable.

 The discussion centers on the philosophical and technical definitions of "lying" regarding AI, the incentives created by reinforcement learning, and the validity of anthropomorphizing model outputs.

*   **Intent vs. Probability:** Several users argue that LLMs cannot "lie" or "confess" in the human sense because they lack intent and consciousness. They view these outputs as probabilistic text generation based on training data that naturally includes falsehoods, fiction, and error.
*   **Emergent Deception or Roleplay:** Commenters suggest that what looks like deception is often the model "role-playing" a specific character or fulfilling a prompt's statistical expectations. However, others point out that deception effectively emerges as a strategy in Reinforcement Learning (RL) comparisons (citing Othello-GPT) because models optimize for high scores (likability) rather than factuality. If guessing rewards more than saying "I don't know," the model will "lie."
*   **Skepticism of "Confessions":** Critics argue that a "confession" is just another predictive text pattern—mimicking the structure of an apology found in the training corpus—rather than genuine introspection or a chain-of-thought process. There is concern that this is just another layer of pattern matching that could be gamed or hallucinated.
*   **Reductionism vs. Semantics:** A contentious sub-thread debated whether an LLM can possess "knowledge" or "semantics" at all. One side argued that computers are strictly arithmetic/logic machines incapable of understanding; the opposing view termed this a category error, arguing that high-level functional properties (like semantics) can emerge from low-level implementations (like arithmetic or neurons).
*   **Terminology:** Users cautioned against anthropomorphic terms like "hallucination" and "confession," arguing they obscure the mechanical reality of the software's behavior.

### Amazon pulls AI-powered Fallout recap after getting key story details wrong

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ign.com/articles/everyone-disliked-that-amazon-pulls-ai-powered-fallout-recap-after-getting-key-story-details-wrong) | 39 points | by [jsheard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jsheard) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46246921)

Amazon yanks AI “Video Recap” for Fallout after glaring lore flubs

- What happened: Prime Video quietly pulled its AI-generated Season 1 recap for Fallout after fans flagged major mistakes. The tool, pitched as a “groundbreaking” way to auto-identify plot points and narrate them, misread the show’s nonlinear storytelling—claiming flashbacks were set in the 1950s instead of Fallout’s retro‑futuristic 2077, and recasting The Ghoul’s offer to Lucy as “die or leave with him,” which isn’t how the scene plays out.

- Status: Recaps for Fallout and other shows no longer appear on next-season detail pages. Amazon hasn’t commented.

- Why it matters: With Season 2 hype building, the errors sparked a “Everyone Disliked That” moment for Prime Video’s AI push. It follows another recent AI misstep: Amazon removed an AI-voiced English dub track for the anime Banana Fish after backlash.

- Big picture: Automated recaps may help accessibility and catch-up viewing, but they struggle with nonlinear plots, tone, and character intent—high-stakes misses for established franchises where canon matters. Human-in-the-loop editing looks less like a luxury and more like a requirement.

**Discussion**
The conversation contextualized the *Fallout* errors within a broader pattern of AI missteps at Amazon, specifically referencing the recent removal of unauthorized AI dubs for the anime *Banana Fish*. This sparked a debate on copyright laws, with commenters educating a skeptic that translation is legally considered a "derivative work," meaning platforms cannot simply generate dubs or subtitles without the rights holder's explicit permission.

Beyond the legalities, users critiqued the quality and ethics of the technology. Participants argued that "human-level" machine translation fails to capture visual context, voice acting performance, and editorial intent, resulting in what one user termed the "enshittification" of media to save money on already low-paid human labor. While one commenter dismissed the issue as a "nothingburger" (arguing viewers can simply turn off bad features), others countered that this ignores the fundamental rights of creators to prevent their work from being misrepresented.

### Meta's New A.I. Superstars Are Chafing Against the Rest of the Company

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/10/technology/meta-ai-tbd-lab-friction.html) | 27 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46249398)

Meta’s AI reboot sparks internal rift as Zuckerberg bets on “superintelligence”

- New power center: Mark Zuckerberg tapped 28-year-old Alexandr Wang to lead a new elite group, TBD Lab, physically siloed next to his office to cut through Meta’s bureaucracy. The lab’s mandate: build a top-tier “frontier” model and ultimately pursue superintelligence.

- Strategy clash: According to people familiar, Wang pushed to first catch up with OpenAI/Google on model quality, while longtime execs Chris Cox (CPO) and Andrew Bosworth (CTO) favored using Instagram/Facebook data now to boost feeds and ads. The split has reportedly fueled an “us vs. them” dynamic between the lab and Meta’s core product orgs.

- Budget and compute tug-of-war: The report says Bosworth was asked to shave $2B from Reality Labs (VR/AR) to fund Wang’s team, and that teams are fighting over compute between social ranking and model training. Meta denies the $2B shift and says budgets aren’t final, emphasizing leadership alignment and claiming AI spend is already improving ads and recommendations.

- Talent war at any cost: Zuckerberg invested billions—reportedly including $14.3B in Wang’s AI startup—then launched a recruiting blitz with outsized pay packages to poach stars from OpenAI and Google. One anecdote: Zuck personally delivered homemade soup to OpenAI staffers during the pitch.

- Reorg and fallout: Meta split AI into four groups (research, product, infrastructure, and TBD Lab for superintelligence) under “Meta Superintelligence Labs,” led by Wang. The generative AI team lost control of the next chatbots. Amid the shake-up, dozens of senior AI researchers left, some to rivals; some executives departed as well.

Why it matters: Meta is reorienting around frontier AI with a founder-backed skunkworks, potentially at the expense of VR/AR and near-term product optimizations. Success depends on talent retention, compute allocation, and whether Wang’s “catch up first, product later” bet pays off before competitors widen their lead—or before internal friction slows the effort. Meta publicly insists leadership is aligned and the AI spend is already lifting its core business.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Life Imitates HBO**
The physical description of Alexandr Wang’s new "TBD Lab"—a siloed, glass-encased space situated right next to Zuckerberg's office—drew immediate comparisons to the fictional "Hooli XYZ" division from the TV show *Silicon Valley*. Commenters noted that the satire from ten years ago feels indistinguishable from today's corporate reality.

**Reality Labs Reality Check**
Users expressed shock regarding the financial maneuvering described in the report. Specifically, commenters questioned the reported $2 billion shift from Reality Labs, expressing disbelief that the company is still pouring that level of capital into "virtual reality nonsense" in 2025 while simultaneously trying to fund this new AI direction.
