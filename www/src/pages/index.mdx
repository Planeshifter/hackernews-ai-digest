#### [Submission URL](https://wilsoniumite.com/2025/03/10/people-are-just-as-bad-as-my-llms/) | 184 points | by [Wilsoniumite](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Wilsoniumite) | [150 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43323755)

In a humorous and insightful exploration, a Hacker News user recounts their experiment with Language Learning Models (LLMs) to rank 97 fellow users based on their potential as software engineers at Google. Despite a random naming system in place, the LLMs showed a peculiar bias, often favoring "Person One" or "Person Two" even though names were allocated randomly. The writer's frustration grew as attempts to rectify this bias through various methods, such as modifying prompts, proved ineffective.

Curiously, when humans were brought in for a related experiment to rank Text-to-Speech (TTS) voices, they exhibited their own biases – notably a preference for the right-side sample, a phenomenon previously documented in psychological studies. This revelation was both vexing and vindicating, illustrating that humans are just as prone to biases as AIs are.

The crux of the story is a reminder of the persistent nature of bias, whether in AIs or humans, and the importance of large sample sizes and randomization to mitigate its effects. It humorously suggests that the measures we use to navigate human biases can be beneficial in managing AI inconsistencies too. If you feel like putting it to the test, the user welcomes you to provide your unbiased rankings of TTS voices. Check out their ongoing study and contribute at [link](https://tts-attractiveness.web.app/).

Many models defaulted to outdated or fabricated dates, highlighting their reliance on static training data and inability to access real-time information.  

2. **Bias and Overconfidence**: LLMs often produce confidently wrong answers (e.g., nonsensical explanations about "how chickens lay eggs"), mirroring human tendencies toward overconfidence despite flawed reasoning. This parallels the original submission’s observation that both humans and AI exhibit stubborn biases.  

3. **AGI and Intelligence Debates**: Skepticism emerged about LLMs being steps toward AGI. Critics argued they lack true understanding, introspection, or contextual awareness, with one user quipping, "LLMs are closer to Alzheimers patients" due to their confident yet disconnected responses.  

4. **Human vs. AI Capabilities**: Discussions compared AI’s limitations to human shortcomings. Some noted that even successful humans might not fit narrow definitions of "intelligence," while others debated creativity—whether "novel solutions" require prior knowledge or arise from deduction/observation.  

5. **Practical Concerns**: Users expressed worries about AI replacing human roles, particularly outside STEM, where its unreliability could lead to chaotic outcomes. Others suggested technical fixes (e.g., injecting real-time metadata), though these were seen as partial solutions.  

6. **Philosophical Tangents**: References to Kant’s philosophy and critiques of how intelligence is measured underscored the complexity of defining "intelligence" for both humans and machines.  

The thread concluded with a mix of frustration and fascination, acknowledging AI’s potential while emphasizing its current flaws and the need for rigorous testing, transparency, and humility in deployment.

In a fascinating fusion of simplicity and depth, "antirez" unveils a C-coded reinforcement learning (RL) masterpiece, showcasing a neural network learning the humble game of tic-tac-toe—without reliance on external libraries or frameworks. This elegant piece of code, a mere semblance of the often vast RL libraries, fits snugly within 400 lines and intentionally embraces clarity for the curious developer.

Here's the scoop: constructed from scratch, this neural network learns from scratch too. With zero knowledge about tic-tac-toe intricacies, save for avoiding moves in occupied spots and recognizing wins, ties, or losses, the program embarks on a tabula rasa journey. It's truly a neural novice, initializing with random weights and playing against a shambling, random-move adversary until it learns to excel through sheer practice—achieving an impressive win rate after millions of games.

The repo is neatly organized: the game states are driven by simple structs, while a hard-coded neural network processes inputs and generates outputs, modeling the sparse 5,478 states of tic-tac-toe. With no more than 2809 parameters, this minimalist network demonstrates how straightforward mechanics like RELU activations and softmax outputs can still lead to near-perfect play. 

For those looking to roll this program on their own hardware, the package is openly licensed under BSD-2-Clause, providing a delightful experience—code, compile, and go head-to-head against an RL-enhanced opponent. Run it for enough matches, and it may become the unbeaten tic-tac-toe tactician.

This project packs a punch for aspiring programmers and AI enthusiasts to understand the essence of reinforcement learning and neural networks, while also celebrating the ingenuity of learning models, minus the overwhelming complexity—an homage to simplistic brilliance worthy of a Turing Award nod to Sutton and Barto. Whether for education or sheer curiosity, diving into antirez's ttt-rl promises a rewarding escalation from novice to savvy strategist.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion begins with user **trc** questioning how the neural network in the tic-tac-toe program understands scoring and game mechanics, expressing confusion about its learning process. **antirez**, the creator, clarifies that the program uses reinforcement learning (RL) to grasp game rules *intrinsically* (e.g., blocking opponent moves, seeking wins) and emphasizes that the neural network starts with **random weights**, improving through trial and error against random opponents.  

**trc** acknowledges the explanation, stating the clarified logic now "makes sense" after reviewing the code and thanking **antirez** for sharing. **antirez** reciprocates with a brief gratitude note. The exchange highlights curiosity about the minimalist RL/neural network design and satisfaction with the subsequent clarity provided.

### The program is the database is the interface

#### [Submission URL](https://www.scattered-thoughts.net/writing/the-program-is-the-database-is-the-interface/) | 182 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [52 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43300528)

A developer recently shared an insightful look into their personal accounting script, tackling both the merits and challenges of keeping it simple. The setup includes a straightforward Clojure script which processes transaction data from a CSV file and classifies expenses into categories using basic rules. This script is powerful in its simplicity, leveraging a single-file approach that makes it easy to back up and version-control while using pretty-printed data structures to sidestep building a full UI.

However, as practical as this solution is, it falls short in scenarios involving large data sets or collaborative environments. Modifying tagging rules is manual and becomes cumbersome with thousands of transactions. Sharing this script with non-technical users requires setup guidance, making the process less than ideal for collaboration.

The developer contemplated enriching the user experience with a web app, where transactions and their tags could be managed via a database. Such a solution offers intuitive controls and ease of sharing but at the cost of increased complexity. This entails dealing with a different data model, handling a query language or API, and managing state in a GUI environment, all of which require substantial effort.

Addressing these challenges while preserving efficiency, the developer unveiled a hacky yet innovative solution: an interactive notebook-like environment. This setup retains the script's accessibility and simplicity while offering code cells for dynamic interaction and rendering results. Though still a work in progress, it's a promising middle ground that lets users enjoy low-effort simplicity with improved interaction—just what one needs to handle year-end accounts without the hassle of a fully-fledged application.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the tension between simplicity and scalability in software design, inspired by the developer's Clojure-based accounting script. Key themes include:

1. **Lisp Principles & Simplicity**:  
   - Commenters highlight how LISP/Clojure’s "direct connection" philosophy (collapsing data, logic, and UI layers) reduces complexity, as seen in REPLs and notebooks. This aligns with Rich Hickey’s *Simple Made Easy*—prioritizing simplicity over familiarity.  
   - However, critics note this approach struggles at scale (e.g., collaborative systems, rigid interfaces) and risks Greenspun’s Tenth Rule: ad-hoc complexity creeping into "simple" systems.

2. **Trade-offs in System Design**:  
   - Small tools excel for personal use but face challenges when scaling. One user shares a cautionary tale: a company’s direct database access led to months-long schema changes and broken dependencies.  
   - Others reference **Conway’s Law**, arguing organizational structure dictates system design. Simple tools work early but require standardization (e.g., APIs, schemas) as they grow.

3. **SQL vs. Code Debates**:  
   - Some advocate embedding business logic in SQL for standardization, while others warn it creates unmaintainable "code soup." Tools like `gtkit` or `srql` are suggested for structured data exploration.  
   - Spreadsheets are praised as Lisp-like tools for non-programmers but criticized for lacking version control and auditability.

4. **Nostalgia & Modern Parallels**:  
   - A 1970s BASIC program with embedded data statements is compared to modern scripts, sparking reflections on how past constraints shaped design.  
   - Excel’s duality is debated: praised for rapid prototyping but infamous for financial mishaps (e.g., a $1M error from unmaintained spreadsheets).

5. **Developer Experience (DX)**:  
   - Users stress the importance of clean interfaces and tools (e.g., notebooks, IDE feedback) to balance simplicity with functionality.  

**Takeaway**: The thread underscores that simplicity is context-dependent. While Lisp-inspired minimalism empowers individuals, real-world systems often demand structured boundaries—even if they introduce complexity. The ideal tool balances directness with scalability, avoiding both over-engineering and under-planning.

#### [Submission URL](https://usher.dev/posts/2025-03-08-kill-your-feeds/) | 741 points | by [tom_usher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tom_usher) | [296 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43302132)

In the digital age, our minds are becoming playgrounds for algorithmic manipulation. "Kill Your Feeds - Stop letting algorithms dictate how you think" delves into how social media giants sneakily transform our scrolling sessions into profit-driven propaganda tools. Once a realm for connecting with friends, platforms like Facebook and Instagram have subtly rewired themselves into potent puppeteers of our thought processes, shaping what we see, our moods, and even our beliefs.

This massive shift didn't happen overnight. It was a methodical progression, one tweak at a time. Companies knew our finite interactions couldn't sustain their endless revenue goals. Enter the algorithmic titans - feeds reimagined to endlessly dribble content that hooks us deeper, breeding both comfort and conspiracy. 

A dystopian future where megacorporations control our minds? It turns out we're halfway there. Our eyes, not implanted chips, are the keys to our consciousness. As we doom-scroll through personalized content, the subtle sway of outrage and extremism cloaks our brain. These mind-numbing loops not only reinforce our beliefs but effectively seal off opposing viewpoints.

The article urges a rebellious take-back mission. We must loosen algorithms' grip, turning towards conscious choices in consuming content. It advocates for direct interactions—seek out creators directly rather than swimming in the toxic sea of predictive feeds. Lean on tools that offer control, like curating a YouTube subscription page or opting for RSS feeds.

As the quiet radicalization creeps in, feeding extremism and mental fragmentation, the call to action is clear: reclaim control over your digital experience. Ignite conversations, educate those around you, and resist the algorithmic choke-hold. Our minds, after all, should serve us—nurtured by a wealth of independent, critical thought—rather than cater to the whims of corporate interests. Kill the feeds before they hijack our autonomy.

The discussion revolves around the pervasive influence of algorithms, particularly YouTube's recommendation system, and strategies to reclaim control over content consumption. Key points include:

1. **Algorithmic Critiques**:  
   - Users highlight how YouTube's algorithm promotes clickbait, echo chambers, and repetitive content through "explore-exploit" dynamics, prioritizing engagement over quality.  
   - Concerns are raised about feedback loops and the platform's shift from serving users to maximizing corporate profits.

2. **Personal Experiences**:  
   - Many note how recommendations homogenize feeds (e.g., watching *one* Minecraft video floods the front page with similar content).  
   - Non-English creators face issues with AI-driven translations misrepresenting their work.  

3. **Resistance Strategies**:  
   - **Manual Curation**: Subscribing directly to creators, using RSS feeds, or tools like FreeTube to avoid algorithmic suggestions.  
   - **Blocking Tools**: Extensions like uBlock Origin, SponsorBlock (to skip ads), and YouTube Revanced (to disable Shorts) are popular.  
   - **Behavioral Adjustments**: Aggressively marking "Not Interested," clearing watch history, and using Incognito mode to avoid training the algorithm.  

4. **Broader Philosophical Concerns**:  
   - References to Neil Postman’s *Amusing Ourselves to Death* emphasize how algorithms exacerbate societal fragmentation and erode critical thinking.  
   - Calls for decentralized, open-source alternatives to corporate-controlled platforms.  

5. **Monetization Criticisms**:  
   - Users criticize YouTube Premium for failing to improve recommendations and enabling low-quality, ad-driven content.  

**Conclusion**: Participants advocate for conscious content curation, technical workarounds, and systemic changes to resist algorithmic control, seeking diversity in thought and autonomy over digital experiences.

### Doge Has Deployed Its GSAi Custom Chatbot for 1,500 Federal Workers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/gsai-chatbot-1500-federal-workers/) | 15 points | by [ok123456](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ok123456) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43302631)

In a significant shift towards automation, Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has introduced GSAi, a proprietary chatbot, to 1,500 workers at the General Services Administration. This move is part of a wider strategy to automate tasks historically carried out by humans, with an eye toward optimizing operations within federal agencies. GSAi, akin to commercial tools like ChatGPT, is tailored for secure government use, aiding in tasks such as email drafting, summarizing texts, and writing code. However, users are warned against inputting federal nonpublic information.

The initiative follows a successful pilot with 150 GSA users in February, underlining DOGE's aggressive rollout timeline. With three choices for interaction—Claude Haiku 3.5, Claude Sonnet 3.5 v2, and Meta LLaMa 3.2—the tool aims to enhance productivity across the agency.

Nonetheless, there's skepticism about the broader implications of this AI deployment. A prominent AI expert voiced concerns that widespread AI incorporation might be a prelude to further layoffs in the federal workforce. Meanwhile, other agencies like the Treasury and the Department of Health are considering incorporating similar AI systems.

In related developments, the Army is using CamoGPT to alter training materials, and GSA's tech division is set to downsize, emphasizing public-facing projects. The overarching theme from leaders like Thomas Shedd is a push for a "high-performance team" bolstered by AI's capabilities. This development aligns with Shedd's vision of integrating AI centrally within the Technology Transformation Services' agenda. Critics, however, caution the move might just be another step in legitimizing workforce reductions.

The Hacker News discussion highlights mixed reactions to the deployment of GSAi and broader concerns about AI integration in government:  

1. **Security and Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Users note warnings against inputting nonpublic federal information into GSAi, with skepticism about whether employees might inadvertently share sensitive data (e.g., personal details, emails, photos).  
   - One commenter points out that such warnings are standard for corporate AI tools but warns of risks like data leaks, fraud, or misuse of confidential information. Another criticizes companies and agencies for carelessly handling sensitive data, calling it "shocking."  

2. **Skepticism Toward Musk’s Involvement**:  
   - A user dismisses the initiative as "Musk’s damn bullshit," implying distrust of his motives or the legitimacy of the project.  
   - Speculation arises about whether Musk’s xAI is involved, with a pun on "DOGE" (referencing both the Department of Government Efficiency and Dogecoin, which Musk has promoted).  

3. **Broader Cynicism**:  
   - Critics suggest the rollout might prioritize cost-cutting or corporate interests over genuine efficiency or security, aligning with earlier concerns in the submission about layoffs and rushed AI adoption.  

In short, the discussion reflects distrust of both the technology’s safeguards and Musk’s role, alongside fears that sensitive data could be mishandled in the push for automation.
