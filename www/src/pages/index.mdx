In the latest episode of the CoRecursive podcast, host Adam Gordon Bell tells the fascinating story of Ron Garret's experience trying to bring LISP programming into the world of space exploration. In 1988, Ron was working on the prototype for the first Mars Rover at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The goal was to develop software that would allow NASA to send an autonomous rover to Mars. However, using LISP, a programming language known for its use of parentheses and treating code as data, was not the norm at NASA.

Operating a rover on Mars presented several challenges, including a 40-minute round-trip light time delay. This meant that remote operation of the rover was not feasible, and autonomy was crucial. Ron and his team wanted to push the boundaries of autonomy to enable the rover to accomplish more within each command cycle.

While Ron's office at JPL was fairly standard, he had access to an electronic shop and occasionally took the robots outdoors for testing. The robots included FANG, a large rover the size of half a refrigerator, Tooth, a shoebox-sized robot, and Robbie, a six-wheeled rover the size of an SUV. These prototypes eventually led to the development of the Sojourner rover, which landed on Mars in 1997.

Ron's team chose to use LISP for their software development, but it was not a common choice at NASA. As a result, they faced skepticism from colleagues and project managers who favored more traditional programming languages. Despite the challenges, Ron and his team continued to develop the software using LISP.

Their work eventually caught the attention of NASA's New Millennium Program, which aimed to develop new technologies for space exploration. This led to the Deep Space 1 mission, which included the Remote Agent, an autonomous onboard software developed with LISP. The mission encountered project management difficulties, but the Remote Agent performed admirably.

One notable challenge Ron faced was debugging code in space. Since the Rover had limited computational power and storage, traditional debugging techniques were not feasible. Ron solved this problem by developing a system for sending S-expressions remotely, allowing him to analyze and fix code on the Rover.

Overall, Ron's experience raises the question of whether using LISP was worth the effort. While it may not have been the most popular choice at NASA, the unique capabilities of LISP offered new possibilities for autonomous software development in space exploration.

MK-1 is a new startup that aims to provide companies with the same efficient language model capabilities as elite AI powerhouses like OpenAI and Google. Their first product, MKML, is an inference runtime that can significantly reduce the costs and improve the performance of large language models on GPUs.

One of the main challenges that MKML addresses is the large memory footprint of these models, which can limit performance and increase costs. MKML has developed a compression technique that can reduce the size of models by about 60%, while maintaining a high fidelity to the original model. For example, a Llama-2 13B model that initially requires 26GB of memory can be shrunk down to just 10.5GB with MKML.

The benefits of using MKML are twofold. Firstly, it allows companies to use lower-cost GPU instances that have less memory capacity, without sacrificing performance. For example, the compressed Llama-2 13B model can now fit on a single A10 24GB instance, which is about 45% less expensive than the A100 instance. Secondly, for companies that can afford the more powerful A100 instance, MKML can increase performance by up to 2.0x compared to the baseline model.

MKML is designed to be easy to integrate into existing workflows and works seamlessly with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch. With just a few lines of Python code, developers can compress their models and use MKML for inference.

The performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, and the results consistently show that it outperforms the baseline model in terms of token generation speed. Additionally, the compressed models maintain a high level of fidelity, with only a small difference in perplexity compared to the original models.

MK-1 is currently in closed beta release, but if you're interested in becoming an early partner and gaining access to new features, you can contact them for more information. With MKML, companies can optimize their inference stack, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of their language models.

The discussion around the submission on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of MKML and its comparison to existing methods.

One commenter points out that quantization methods that are already available usually provide comparable results to what MKML is claiming. They mention that these techniques have already been widely used and question the novelty of MKML's approach.

The founder of MK-1, Paul Merolla, responds to address the comments. He explains that MKML is designed to be a targeted solution that focuses on compressing models with high performance and efficiency. He highlights that MKML builds on the existing framework of Hugging Face and other popular ecosystems. He also mentions that the performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, consistently outperforming the baseline models.

Another commenter raises a question about the integration of MKML and the existing frameworks like Hugging Face. Paul Merolla responds and clarifies that MKML is not simply repackaging existing frameworks, but rather integrating its own compression scheme. He emphasizes that MKML targets multi-task, multi-prompt batch=1 use cases and achieves faster token generation speed compared to other methods.

The discussion further delves into specific technical questions about memory footprint, batch sizes, and model performance. Paul Merolla provides detailed answers and also mentions that MK-1 is working on wrapping their techniques and tools into open-source software.

The latest version of OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, has been causing some confusion due to its non-deterministic behavior. Even when set to a temperature of 0.0, which should result in deterministic output, GPT-4 still produces different results. This has raised questions about why this behavior persists, especially since it was reported over three years ago.

A recent paper on Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models may provide some insights. In the paper, it was mentioned that MoE models, like GPT-4, can become non-deterministic at the sequence level when tokens from different sequences compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. This suggests that the non-determinism in GPT-4 could be attributed to its Sparse MoE architecture.

To test this hypothesis, the author decided to ask GPT-4 itself by writing a script that generates multiple completions using different models. The results of the experiment confirmed that GPT-4's non-determinism is consistent across models, providing further evidence for the impact of its Sparse MoE architecture.

While the exact cause of the non-determinism is still not fully understood, this research offers valuable insights into the behavior of GPT-4 and highlights the challenges in achieving full determinism in complex language models.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the non-deterministic behavior of OpenAI's GPT-4 language model and the reasons behind it. Some commenters point out that non-determinism is expected in certain scenarios, such as with GPUs or when using certain programming primitives. Others suggest that the behavior may be related to the design of GPT-4's Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.

There is debate about the impact of non-deterministic behavior on performance and reliability. Some argue that determinism is crucial for reproducibility and safety, while others suggest that the benefits of non-determinism, such as improved performance, outweigh the drawbacks.

The discussion also touches on the challenges of achieving determinism in complex language models and the trade-offs involved. It is noted that achieving determinism often comes at the cost of increased development time and potential performance overhead.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and trade-offs involved in ensuring determinism in language models like GPT-4, as well as the varying perspectives on the importance of determinism in different contexts.

Bioengineers at the University of Pennsylvania have used artificial intelligence (AI) to identify antimicrobial peptides from proteins found in Neanderthals and Denisovans, which could inspire new drugs to treat human infections. The researchers trained an AI algorithm to recognize sites on human proteins where they are known to be cut into peptides, and used the properties of previously-described antimicrobial peptides to predict new peptides that might kill bacteria. Testing dozens of peptides, the team found that all six potent peptides stopped the growth of bacteria in laboratory dishes, and five molecules killed bacteria growing in skin abscesses. The researchers believe that tweaking the most successful molecules and improving the algorithm could lead to more effective versions. Although some experts have questioned the clinical relevance of this approach, others have praised the study for its innovation in the field of antibiotic development.

### Why transformative artificial intelligence is hard to achieve

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) | 79 points | by [hunglee2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hunglee2) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36934032)

Transformative artificial intelligence (AI) has been talked about as the next major technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the world. But according to a recent essay, achieving this level of AI is actually extremely difficult. The article highlights several challenges that stand in the way of transformative AI.

One of the main challenges is the complexity of AI itself. AI systems would need to be as good as or better than humans at all economically valuable tasks in order to be truly transformative. However, measuring AI's performance on predetermined tasks is risky, as there may be tasks we're not even aware of that are necessary for real-world impact. The essay defines transformative AI in terms of its observed economic impact, specifically looking at productivity growth.

Another challenge is the potential imbalance in productivity growth. Even if AI progresses rapidly in certain areas, there may still be major technical hurdles to overcome in other areas. And even if AI can automate many tasks, it may not be able to automate all tasks, leaving certain sectors relatively more valuable and limiting the overall impact on the economy. This has been observed in the past, where productivity growth has been uneven across sectors, leading to slower overall growth.

Furthermore, the production of ideas itself has bottlenecks that are difficult to overcome. Automating certain tasks may have different effects on growth compared to automating all tasks. Some steps in the innovation process may be essential but hard to improve, leading to constraints on explosive growth.

Overall, the essay suggests that while AI has the potential to be transformative, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed. It's important to temper expectations and recognize the complexities and limitations of achieving transformative AI.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to transformative AI. Some users question whether AI can truly make significant contributions to society, particularly in the realm of mathematics, while others argue that AI has the potential to generate novel mathematical proofs. There is also a discussion about the limitations of current AI models, such as their lack of true understanding and the need for more diverse training data. The topic of intelligence and the definition of intelligence in AI systems is also touched upon. Additionally, there is a debate about whether AI can surpass human capabilities, with some suggesting that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for humans.
