Today on Hacker News, a fascinating paper titled "Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs" was shared. The paper, authored by Sahil Bhatia and four others, explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically transpile code while ensuring functional correctness guarantees. The proposal, called LLMLift, leverages LLMs to reason about programs and generate proofs for functional equivalence during code translation, ultimately outperforming previous tools in both benchmarks transpiled and transpilation time. This innovative approach not only streamlines the transpilation process but also reduces the expertise required to build such tools. For those interested in the intersection of programming languages and LLMs, this paper offers valuable insights and advancements in the field.

The discussion on the submission is centered around skepticism regarding the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating valid proofs for code transpilation. One user, "brfbggns," expresses doubt about the ability of LLMs to attach a proof engine and generate valid proofs, which seems to challenge the authority of Yann LeCunn, a prominent figure in the field. Another user, "prince617," responds by stating that LLM answers do not contain hallucinations or possess proof engines. "brfbggns" elaborates, mentioning that while they have engaged with LLM proof engines in a strictly defined formal context, they find them to be challenging as they seem to fall short on providing correct proofs. The conversation delves into the intricacies of LLMs in generating proofs and the potential limitations they might face in truly representing truth. The discussion highlights a critical examination of the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, despite the motivations behind their creation and utilization in code transpilation processes.

It seems like there may have been an error in the input provided. If you have a specific article or topic from Hacker News that you would like summarized, please provide that information so I can generate a summary for you.

The discussion seems to be about a tweet by Karpathy regarding something related to visibility. One user, "gnbgb", is advising against making changes to titles in an attempt to make them stand out, and instead suggests using the original title or source.

### A look at search engines with their own indexes (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://seirdy.one/posts/2021/03/10/search-engines-with-own-indexes/) | 74 points | by [mnem](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mnem) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40626011)

Today on Hacker News, a user shared their comprehensive review of various indexing search engines, focusing on the top three: Google, Bing, and Yandex. The author painstakingly tested and cataloged different search engines, prioritizing breadth over depth. They highlighted that while many alternative search engines exist, most of them source their results from these three giants. 

The author evaluated English-speaking search engines primarily due to their language proficiency, noting details like "allows site submissions" and structured data support to inform authors about their options. Google, with the biggest index, supports submitting pages and sitemaps for crawling. Bing, the runner-up, allows page submissions without login and shares submissions with Yandex and Seznam. Yandex, originally Russian, has an English version and shares submissions with Bing and Seznam.

Additionally, the author listed smaller search engines with less relevant results, such as Stract, Right Dao, Alexandria, and Yep, each with its own unique features and focus areas. Stract, for example, supports advanced ranking customization, while Alexandria, a new "non-profit, ad free" engine, excels at finding recent pages.

This exhaustive review provides valuable insights for those looking to explore alternative search engines beyond the mainstream options.

- **srfttn**: The user provided a seemingly garbled comment mentioning semantic indexing and a disclaimer.
- **dng**: Referenced a link to a related article about search engines indexed in 2021 with 114 comments as of June 2022.
- **mrwsl**: Shared thoughts on Mojeek's local search capabilities in the UK, mentioning flaws and suggesting Ecosia as a frequent choice for maps.
- **marginalia_nu**: Engaged in a discussion about location-based search and Google's dominance, bringing up the challenges of internet-scale profiling by Google.
- **rddl**: Mentioned differences in localized search results between Ecosia and Bing in Denmark and how the European Union limits Google's integration of Google Maps.
- **nstgb**: Asked for help with sourcing and integrating tools related to sourcing, aggregation, and searching for supply chain and coding work.
- **jeffreyw128**: Noted the absence of Embeddings-based search engines in the review.
- **HeatrayEnjoyer** and **jnlsncm**: Discussed the intricacies of embedding-based search engines, touching on query classes, similarity metrics, and related topics.
- **cynydz**: Contrasted embedding-based search engines with AI-generated embeddings, highlighting the arbitrary dimensions and similarity calculations.
- **Wakawaka28**: Shared a brief comment mentioning "lst 2024."

### (Work in progress) LLVM Libc: The LLVM C Library

#### [Submission URL](https://libc.llvm.org/index.html) | 21 points | by [yla92](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yla92) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40621379)

The LLVM C Library aims to carve out a unique niche in the software world with ambitious goals such as full compliance with current C standards and POSIX, easy embeddability, and the ability to create fully static binaries without licensing issues. This project offers a range of benefits, including consistent math precision across systems, opportunities for whole program optimization, and reduced coding errors by leveraging modern C++. Development is currently focused on x86_64 and aarch64 on Linux, with some testing on Windows and adoption by the Fuchsia platform. The libc is designed to be ABI independent, enabling support for various ABIs, although ABI stability is not yet established. Interested developers can dive into usage modes, development guides, and contributing to the project, as well as join the community on Discord.

The discussion on the submission mainly involves sharing related links and expressing difficulties in understanding certain aspects of the project. One user shared a link related to Rich Felker's work on the project, another mentioned the possibility of LLVM supporting GPUs, and a third user expressed that they found some parts of the project to be challenging to understand. The conversation seems to be quite brief and focuses on sharing additional information and personal opinions.
