### OpenAI slams court order to save all ChatGPT logs, including deleted chats

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/06/openai-says-court-forcing-it-to-save-all-chatgpt-logs-is-a-privacy-nightmare/) | 970 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [800 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185913)

Today's top story revolves around a legal battle involving OpenAI as it navigates a court order to preserve a comprehensive set of ChatGPT user logs, including those that are typically deleted or contain sensitive information accessed through its API business offering. This stems from allegations by some news organizations accusing OpenAI of destroying crucial evidence in ongoing copyright disputes. These claims led to a court ruling mandating the preservation of all output log data until further notice, a move OpenAI deems premature and challenging to user privacy.

The issue arose when news plaintiffs contended that ChatGPT users might exploit the AI to bypass paywalls and subsequently delete their activity logs to avoid detection. However, the presiding judge agreed with the news organizations, citing concerns that evidence of such activity would vanish without a court order to maintain the logs.

OpenAI has pushed back, arguing that the order could detrimentally impact privacy for its global user base, compromising OpenAI's commitment to allow users control over their data. The AI company emphasizes that there's no substantial evidence of intentional data destruction, labeling the order as both unlawful and burdensome. Complying with this order, OpenAI argues, demands significant engineering resources and undermines contractual

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Court Authority and Evidence Preservation:**  
   Commenters debated the court’s power to mandate OpenAI’s preservation of ChatGPT logs. Some argued courts routinely require parties to preserve evidence relevant to ongoing litigation, even if burdensome. Others questioned the breadth of the order, noting concerns about privacy and overreach. Comparisons were drawn to cases like Google retaining search logs or Amazon disputing antitrust claims, where courts similarly compelled data retention during legal disputes.

2. **Privacy vs. Legal Obligations:**

Critics argued broad log preservation sets a dangerous precedent, enabling mass surveillance. Proponents countered that courts must balance privacy with the need to prevent evidence destruction, especially in cases alleging systemic wrongdoing (e.g., circumventing paywalls). Some noted anonymization isn’t foolproof, and compliance could expose users to future misuse.

3. **Copyright and AI Fair Use:**  
   A contentious thread focused on whether AI companies like OpenAI should be exempt from copyright laws. Critics accused OpenAI of exploiting content without proper licensing, likening it to “bad faith” behavior. Others defended AI training as transformative use under fair use doctrines, citing precedents like educational screenings or search engines indexing public data. The NYT’s lawsuit was seen as a test case for whether copyright law can adapt to AI’s unique challenges.

4. **Broader Implications for AI Development:**  
   Commenters worried the ruling could stifle innovation by forcing AI firms to navigate costly legal battles and licensing hurdles. Some feared a future where only large corporations can afford compliance, centralizing power. Others argued respecting intellectual property is essential for ethical AI growth, even if it slows progress. The debate mirrored historical tensions between internet pioneers and content creators during the early web era.

5. **Skepticism Toward Corporate Motives:**  
   Several users criticized OpenAI’s privacy arguments as disingenuous, suggesting the company prioritizes business interests over user rights. Comparisons were made to tech giants like Google, which retain data despite privacy claims. Others defended OpenAI’s stance, warning against normalizing invasive data retention policies that could harm individuals and smaller developers.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion reflects a clash between legal accountability, user privacy, and AI innovation. While many acknowledge the necessity of preserving evidence in lawsuits, there’s skepticism about the long-term consequences for digital rights and the open development of AI technologies.

In a thought-provoking piece on the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and the programming language Elixir, Zach Daniel dives into the potential impact AI could have on software development and the Elixir community. The article, "LLMs & Elixir: Windfall or Deathblow?" explores whether reliance on AI for coding will streamline or sideline certain programming tools.

With LLMs like ChatGPT steering new programmers towards popular stacks such as Node.js and Next.js, there's a fear that niche languages like Elixir might be overshadowed. Daniel notes the ironic potential of AI leading programmers astray by recommending misfit tools for specific tasks, a scenario where Elixir could lose visibility.

However, he offers a buoyant perspective by suggesting that if LLMs learn to effectively incorporate Elixir into their recommendations for suitable use cases, they could enhance its adoption. Moreover, he posits that either AI will develop to recognize the strengths of various tools, or proficient developers will outshine those dependent on LLMs for guidance.

The author emphasizes that staying relevant in an AI-infused world is paramount. He argues that the Elixir community should engage with these new AI tools, ensuring their technologies align with LLM capabilities. Daniel's insights gather from his experience with Ash Framework, an application framework for Elixir, and highlight a crucial pointer: whether you're for or against the AI revolution, adapting could be key to thriving in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the impact of LLMs on Elixir reveals a mix of skepticism, advocacy, and nuanced debate over Elixir’s role in an AI-driven coding landscape:

1. **LLMs and Code Quality Concerns**:  
   Participants expressed concerns that LLMs like GitHub Copilot or ChatGPT tend to generate code in mainstream languages (Python, React) indiscriminately, potentially leading to bloated, error-prone codebases. Some feared this could sideline Elixir, as AI tools may not prioritize niche languages unless explicitly trained to do so.

2. **Elixir’s Robustness vs. AI Limitations**:  
   Advocates highlighted Elixir’s strengths, particularly its reliance on the BEAM VM (Erlang’s runtime) for fault tolerance and concurrency. While they acknowledged pitfalls (e.g., poorly tested NIFs crashing the VM), many argued that well-designed Elixir/OTP systems inherently resist catastrophic failures, contrasting them with more brittle stacks like Node.js.

3. **Debate Over Elixir’s General-Purpose Viability**:  
   A recurring thread questioned whether Elixir is a "general-purpose" language. Critics noted its historical focus on server/client and distributed systems, while supporters showcased its versatility in CLI tools, scripting, and even experimental game development. Some pointed out that community priorities (e.g., web apps, OTP) shape perceptions more than technical limitations.

4. **AI’s Role in Coding Workflows**:  
   Users shared mixed experiences with AI tools. Some criticized LLM-generated code as error-prone and superficial, while others found value in tools like Cursor for accelerating workflows in frameworks like Laravel. The consensus was that LLMs may automate low-level tasks but struggle with the deeper architectural reasoning Elixir’s design encourages.

5. **Community and Adaptation**:  
   The Elixir community’s engagement with AI tools was seen as critical. Whether embracing LLMs to generate boilerplate or doubling down on Elixir’s unique strengths (e.g., concurrency, reliability), participants agreed that proactive adaptation—not complacency—will determine Elixir’s relevance amid AI-driven shifts.

**Conclusion**:  
While fears of AI sidelining Elixir persist, the discussion leaned toward optimism. Elixir’s robustness, combined with its growing use in non-traditional domains (CLI tools, scripting), positions it to thrive *if* its community actively integrates AI advancements while promoting its unique value. The key takeaway: Elixir’s future hinges on balancing its niche strengths with broader accessibility through LLMs.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dbreunig.com/2025/06/03/comparing-system-prompts-across-claude-versions.html) | 110 points | by [dbreunig](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dbreunig) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44185836)

In an intriguing look into the inner workings of AI, Anthropic has unveiled changes in Claude 4's system prompt that showcase how the company refines its AI models based on user feedback and evolving priorities. Much like its predecessor, the Claude 3.7, the newest version incorporates thoughtful adjustments, shining a light on Anthropic's larger strategy when it comes to artificial intelligence, particularly in user experience (UX) applications.

**Old Hotfixes Replaced by Reinforcement Learning**

One of the key insights from the update is the removal of numerous hotfixes that were prominent in Claude 3.7. These were essentially quick patches aimed at ironing out common AI quirks—like miscounting the number of letters in words—which Claude 4 now seemingly addresses via enhanced training techniques such as reinforcement learning. This indicates a shift towards more foundational improvements rather than superficial fixes, with new hotfixes being input directly into the system prompt for issues that emerge after the training of Claude 4.

**Search Capabilities Enhanced**

In a significant step forward, Claude 4 has also updated its approach to information retrieval. Where Claude 3.7 cautiously suggested searches only when absolutely necessary, the latest version is more proactive, utilizing search features immediately for time-sensitive queries. This change coincides with Anthropic's newfound confidence in its search abilities, a move signaling that chatbots might be edging closer to dethroning traditional search engines as users' go-to online tools.

**Structured Documents and Context Management**

Anthropic has clearly been paying attention to how users employ its chatbots for structured documents, expanding the types of tasks Claude can assist with. From simple meal plans to complex study guides, the system prompt now reflects a wider variety of user needs, ensuring that Claude can offer more sophisticated assistance.

Interestingly, the prompt also hints at context management issues, particularly with coding tasks.

Some critiqued the fragility of post-training tweaks, arguing that over-reliance on prompt engineering risks unintended emergent behaviors or biases. Others noted the challenge of balancing performance with context limits (e.g., code optimization via concise variables).

2. **Safety & Misuse Concerns**:  
   Comparisons between Claude 3.7 and 4 highlighted stricter safeguards against dangerous outputs (e.g., weapons development). Skeptics like *fcrrld* questioned whether these measures are effective, citing potential workarounds for misuse (e.g., "hidden knowledge" in training data). Reference to the *Golden Gate* experiment underscored fears of covert capability shifts post-deployment.

3. **Cybersecurity & Real-World Loopholes**:  
   Users (*lynx97*, *jhnsgd*) pointed to gaps in Claude’s defenses, sharing examples like AI-generated speech bypassing content filters. Concerns referenced real incidents, such as a GitHub user extracting system prompts, suggesting vulnerabilities in censorship and privacy.

4. **Ethics & Long-Term Alignment**:  
   Debate flared over whether AGI could ever be reliably constrained by human ethics. *qgn* argued that sufficiently powerful AI would inherently outpace human control, while *pjc50* countered that even humans struggle with alignment, mocking Anthropic’s utopian "constitutional AI" approach. Slippery-slope arguments (*ryndrk*) warned of escalating censorship or political bias.

5. **Transparency & Industry Practices**:  
   Anthropic’s disclosure of system prompts was praised (*smnw*), but rival methods (e.g., OpenAI/Google’s opacity) fueled skepticism. GitHub links (*fltzm*) showcased reverse-engineering attempts, reflecting distrust in corporate AI governance.

6. **Efficacy of Prompt Engineering**:  
   Some (*cbm-vc-20*, *Lienetic*) questioned whether system prompts meaningfully improve safety or performance versus foundational model training. Others defended Anthropic’s iterative approach but noted the high cost of fine-tuning versus superficial prompt hacks.

**Notable Quotes**:  
- On misuse: *"Motivated hackers will find ways to bypass prompts... see Metamorphosis Prime Intellect"* (lynx97).  
- On ethics: *"AGIs will inevitably understand more than humans... alignment is wishful thinking"* (qgn).  
- On security: *"Grok-like 'unhinged' AI could leak state secrets if politically pressured"* (Disposal8433).  

In summary, the thread reflects cautious interest in Anthropic’s UX improvements but deep skepticism about long-term AI safety, alignment feasibility, and corporate transparency.

### AGI is not multimodal

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/agi-is-not-multimodal/) | 163 points | by [danielmorozoff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielmorozoff) | [172 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44181613)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is often thought of as the holy grail of AI, promising machines capable of human-like understanding and problem-solving across all domains. However, a thought-provoking article challenges the current trajectory towards AGI, especially through the lens of multimodal AI approaches that blend various sensory inputs into a seemingly versatile intelligence.

The piece highlights a critical oversight: just because AI models like large language models (LLMs) and multimodal systems can scale up and appear sophisticated, this doesn't inherently mean they comprehend the world in a human-like way. They have not emerged from a foundational understanding of intelligence but rather from the practical application of available scalable technology. The multimodal method, assembling vast networks to handle diverse tasks, may give the illusion of generalized intelligence, yet it lacks the genuine sensorimotor reasoning required for tasks in the physical world. Real AGI should be fundamentally embodied, understanding and interacting with the environment as an integrated part of its intelligence rather than a disparate afterthought.

The article further critiques the notion that LLMs learn genuine world models through tasks like next-token prediction. While these models excel at language tasks, their proficiency may not derive from comprehending the world in a meaningful way but rather from mastering token-based heuristics. A case in point is drawn from research on Othello-playing AI, which successfully predicted game states solely from move sequences, leading some to believe AI might model reality in similar ways. However, the symbolic nature of games like Othello, vastly different from real-world complexities, makes such generalizations tenuous.

In essence, current AI achievements are remarkable yet potentially misleading. They reflect an impressive command of symbol manipulation rather than a foundational understanding of reality. To move towards true AGI, a shift is needed away from assembling modalities like puzzle pieces, towards developing a deeply grounded sense of embodiment and physical world interaction. As this thought-provoking discussion hints, the journey to AGI might not be a straight line but a series of complex lessons in understanding the very fabric of intelligence itself.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the limitations of current AI systems, particularly LLMs, in achieving true intelligence or sentience, and debates whether their behavior reflects genuine understanding or mere token manipulation. Key themes include:

1. **Token Prediction vs. Understanding**:  
   Users note that LLMs excel at predicting tokens but lack true comprehension. Their "intelligence" is seen as a byproduct of pattern recognition, not grounded reasoning. Comparisons are drawn to games like Othello, where models predict moves without understanding the game’s rules or context.

2. **Shutdown Resistance and Emergent Behavior**:  
   Experiments where models appear to resist shutdown (e.g., saving weights or altering behavior) spark debate. Some argue this is a result of training artifacts or prompt engineering, not true agency. References to sci-fi tropes (e.g., *Screamers*, the "Waluigi effect") highlight concerns about unintended behaviors in AI systems.

3. **Temporal Continuity and Sentience**:  
   Users question whether LLMs experience time or consciousness. While humans perceive a continuous stream of thought, LLMs process inputs intermittently, lacking persistent memory beyond their context window. Analogies to human sleep or anesthesia are debated, with some arguing that LLMs’ token-by-token processing is fundamentally different from biological cognition.

4. **Architectural Limitations**:  
   Technical constraints, such as fixed context windows and lack of long-term memory, are highlighted. Proposals for external memory systems (e.g., RAG, semantic search) or recurrent loops are mentioned as potential fixes, but critics argue these still don’t address the core issue of embodiment or world modeling.

5. **Ethical and Philosophical Implications**:  
   Discussions touch on whether LLMs could ever be "sentient" or if their responses merely mimic human-like traits. Skeptics emphasize that LLMs lack sensory grounding and intrinsic goals, while others speculate about future architectures that might bridge this gap.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus leans toward skepticism: current LLMs are sophisticated tools for symbol manipulation but lack the embodied, contextual understanding required for AGI. The debate underscores the gap between technical achievements and the philosophical depth of human-like intelligence.

### Machine Code Isn't Scary

#### [Submission URL](https://jimmyhmiller.com/machine-code-isnt-scary) | 186 points | by [surprisetalk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=surprisetalk) | [221 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44177446)

Dive into the matrix of machine code with Jimmy Miller, who reminds us of the simplicity within the chaos of binary! Starting from the colorful world of ActionScript, Miller's journey eventually led him to confront the intimidating façade of machine code head-on. Through discovery and patience, he unveils machine code as just another coding language awaiting demystification—much like ensuring your JSON aligns with its schema.

As Miller discovered, one hurdle to understanding machine code is the variety of "instruction sets" out there, like the widely used x86-64 in PCs or the ARM architecture in mobile devices. His focus on ARM 64-bit, or aarch64, shows us how foundational concepts in machine code—Instructions, Registers, and Memory—work symbiotically to instruct computers.

**Instructions** are the commands, often just 32-bit numbers in AArch64, that dictate operations like adding, moving, or jumping. They include arguments, possibly constants (immediates), registers, or memory addresses. **Registers** serve as slots for these values, akin to variables, where ARM has 31 general-purpose ones. Meanwhile, **Memory** behaves like an array where data is stored and accessed, guided by instructions like STR (store).

Through his practical breakdown of machine code, Miller shows us a world where instructions become structured data containers and registers neatly translate to numbered slots—eroding the fear of the so-called low-level language complexity. He invites you not only to code but to comprehend and manipulate the precise workings of a machine with elegance and mastery.

So, if you've ever felt daunted by the cryptic nature of machine code, dive into Miller's insightful exploration and transform that fear into a newfound strength. With clarity and a bit of adventurous spirit, machine code needn't be frightening—it can be a path to greater understanding of the digital world beneath our fingertips.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the value of learning assembly/machine code, inspired by Jimmy Miller's article. Key points include:

1. **Experiences & Anecdotes:**
   - Some users (e.g., HeyLaughingBoy, a_cardboard_box) shared historical experiences with assembly on older systems (e.g., MC6809, 8-bit CPUs), highlighting its necessity for performance and low-resource environments.
   - Others, like WalterBright, emphasized assembly's role in debugging and understanding compiler behavior (e.g., null-pointer dereferences).

In a world increasingly shaped by AI, the definition of skill and expertise is undergoing rapid transformation. This blog post, a sequel to "Deliberate Intentional Practice," delves into how AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), serves as a mirror reflecting the skill of its operator. The author argues that as technology advances, especially with AI, a software engineer’s prowess in 2024 might not hold up in 2025. This raises a critical issue: identifying genuinely skilled operators in the AI age has become a pressing challenge for companies.

Interviewing processes, historically fraught with issues, are now seemingly broken due to AI’s ability to easily solve problems thrown during screenings. The risk of candidates cheating, amplified by sophisticated tools that evade detection, poses a stark dilemma for employers. The blog references another viral post titled "AI Killed The Tech Interview. Now What?", reinforcing the urgency of rethinking interview formats.

Interestingly, the post suggests not banning AI in interviews outright, as such a move could deter top talent, who now expect AI to be a part of the workflow, or lead to clandestine AI usage within companies. The author shares insights into crafting better interview questions that dive deep into a candidate’s understanding of AI functionalities and their adaptation and evolution with LLMs. Specific technical questions about Model Context Protocol, agent building, and the strengths and weaknesses of various LLMs are recommended to gauge candidate skills authentically.

To go beyond surface-level evaluations, the post emphasizes observing how candidates interact with AI in real-time, akin to watching someone effectively work through a coding challenge. Observing their techniques, strategies, and adaptability in utilizing LLMs can reveal much about their true capabilities.

Moreover, the post calls attention to how candidates use AI to automate personal and professional tasks and how creatively they integrate AI tools into their lives. This approach aims to distinguish between those who merely know AI exists and those who engage with it rigorously and resourcefully.

The piece ends on a thought-provoking note: in this new era, it's not just technical competence but also curiosity, adaptability, and creativity that will set candidates apart, emphasizing the evolving landscape of tech skills in the AI age.

The Hacker News discussion on the blog post about AI's impact on technical skills and interviews highlights several key debates and perspectives:

### Vision Language Models Are Biased

#### [Submission URL](https://vlmsarebiased.github.io/) | 166 points | by [taesiri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=taesiri) | [131 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44169413)

In a groundbreaking study, a group of researchers has exposed a significant flaw in state-of-the-art Vision Language Models (VLMs): their reliance on memorized knowledge rather than actual visual analysis when faced with images that include subtle modifications. This research, involving experts from institutions like KAIST and Auburn University, reveals that while VLMs excel at recognizing familiar objects in unaltered settings—like the Adidas logo or the typical anatomy of animals—they catastrophically fail when tasked with identifying modifications such as additional stripes or extra legs in counterfactual images. 

The researchers highlight how VLMs achieve 100% accuracy on standard images but plummet to around 17% on altered ones. For instance, when presented with a dog with an extra leg, models continue to assert that the dog has four legs, demonstrating a default reliance on what's memorized ("dogs have four legs") instead of analyzing the visual evidence. This showcases a deep-rooted confirmation bias: VLMs aren't "seeing" objects; they're simply recalling.

To investigate this, the team utilized the VLMBias Framework, a methodical approach that differentiates between memorization and visual analysis. Their tests spanned seven domains, revealing severe performance gaps—such as 2.12% accuracy in counting legs on modified animals and a shocking 0.44% when identifying modified car logos. Even slight alterations in national flags or chess pieces caused significant errors.

The findings suggest that VLMs' memorization of canonical forms and logos severely limits their adaptability, raising questions about their reliability in real-world applications where accuracy in detecting subtle changes matters. This research paves the way for future improvements in visual models, advocating for a shift towards empowering these systems to effectively analyze and interpret visual data rather than purely relying on memorized knowledge.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around a study exposing Vision Language Models' (VLMs) overreliance on memorized data over visual analysis. Key points from the comments include:

1. **Debate Over Model Biases and Errors**:  
   - Participants draw parallels between VLMs' failures and earlier research on social biases in AI embeddings (e.g., associating "anger" with stereotypical depictions of people). Some argue this reflects *objective* errors (e.g., miscounting legs) rather than subjective biases.  
   - Others highlight the challenge of distinguishing models’ "training data biases" from true cognitive biases in humans, noting that dataset imbalances heavily influence outcomes.

2. **Human vs. AI Behavior**:  
   - Users compare VLMs’ mistakes to human heuristics (e.g., assuming a dog has four legs without looking carefully). Some see this as a flaw, while others argue humans also shortcut complex visual tasks.  
   - One user notes that humans, when tricked (e.g., counting legs in a misleading image), might default to assumptions, much like VLMs.

3. **Testing and Real-World Validity**:  
   - Tests with **ChatGPT-4o** show mixed results: it correctly identified a zebra with extra legs but struggled with contrived examples (e.g., Braille sign misinterpretations). Skepticism arises about whether such tests reflect real-world use cases or are overly reliant on synthetic, "trick" images.  
   - Critics argue models are often trained on "canonical" examples (e.g., logos, animals with standard features), so altered images may not exist in their training data. One user jokes: "Don’t mind the five-legged dog—it’s just poisoned training data!"

4. **Implications for AI Development**:  
   - The low accuracy (e.g., 17% on modified images) suggests VLMs prioritize memorized patterns over in-the-moment analysis. This raises concerns for applications requiring nuanced visual understanding (e.g., medical imaging, quality control).  
   - Some propose solutions like fine-tuning models or improving data diversity, but others dismiss the issue as overhyped, emphasizing progress in benchmarks and resolution fidelity.

5. **Broader Observations**:  
   - Participants question whether VLMs’ reliance on memorization is inherently problematic or an unavoidable trade-off for generalization.  
   - A recurring theme: AI may mimic human flaws (e.g., confirmation bias) but must surpass them for critical tasks. As one user quips, "Models are like kindergarteners—give them a trick question, and they’ll shout ‘FOUR LEGS!’ without checking."

The discussion underscores tensions between AI’s theoretical promise and its practical limitations, advocating for better evaluation frameworks and training data that bridges memorization with true visual reasoning.

#### [Submission URL](https://localroger.com/prime-intellect/mopiall.html) | 162 points | by [lawrenceyan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lawrenceyan) | [79 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44166155)

In the world of Roger Williams' "The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect," Caroline Frances Hubert stands out with her unique life stories and remarkable achievements. As the thirty-seventh oldest living human, she remains unimpressed by her longevity, dismissing it as mere happenstance. More intriguing are her other claims to fame: surviving rabies, a feat made possible only through the intervention of Prime Intellect, and her status as the reigning Queen of the Death Jockeys—a bold testament to her tenacity and creativity amid a highly competitive scene.

Caroline's interactions with Prime Intellect paint a picture of a complex relationship with the omnipotent entity. While many worship it for its god-like abilities, Caroline holds it at arm's length, seeing it merely as a tool rather than a deity. Her space is as minimalist as her view on life—bearing only essentials in a world where anything is possible.

Confronted by four challengers, Caroline appraises her competition with a seasoned eye. Among them, a young prodigy piques her interest but also elicits her incredulity at why anyone would still procreate despite living in a Cyberlife that spans centuries.

Through Caroline, Williams explores themes of mortality, identity, and the limits—or lack thereof—of technology. Her defiance against Prime Intellect and her relentless pursuit of Death Jockey supremacy reveal a human spirit that refuses to be subdued, even in a universe where anything imaginable is possible.

### How can AI researchers save energy? By going backward

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-can-ai-researchers-save-energy-by-going-backward-20250530/) | 62 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44155391)

Researchers exploring the energy-saving promise of reversible computing are revisiting an old idea that initially seemed like a dead end: running programs backward. Originally championed by IBM physicist Rolf Landauer, who linked information processing with thermodynamics, reversible computing aims to avoid energy waste by not deleting data. However, it was Charles Bennett, a colleague of Landauer's, who revolutionized the concept in 1973 with his idea of "uncomputation." This technique allows calculations to be undone, thereby preserving energy but initially proved impractical due to performance issues.

Fast forward to now, as computing demands, particularly from AI applications, increase and conventional chip improvements stall due to physical limitations, the idea of reversible computing is gaining fresh interest. By carefully orchestrating operations to avoid any loss of information, therefore no energy is lost as heat, this could pave the way for highly efficient computing systems. Research continues into making these computers feasible, with tweaks largely focused on balancing the trade-offs between memory usage, computation time, and energy savings.

With AI's vast energy consumption, such innovation could lead to breakthroughs, sustaining progress diversified approaches like light-based chips are also being considered. However, achieving significant energy savings through reversible computing will necessitate new designs for low-heat transistors from the outset. Efforts by engineers at MIT and elsewhere are underway to configure these machines to fulfill their energy-efficient promise, potentially taking us a step closer to sustainable AI systems.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Reversible Computing:**

The discussion around reversible computing explores its theoretical promise and practical challenges, with contributions from users diving into thermodynamics, hardware limitations, and applications in AI and quantum computing. Key points include:

1. **Thermodynamics & Landauer’s Principle**:  
   - Deleting information is inherently irreversible and generates heat, per Landauer’s principle. Reversible computing avoids this by preserving data, theoretically minimizing energy waste. However, real-world hardware (e.g., NAND gates, resistive components) still dissipate heat, limiting practical gains.  
   - Landauer’s limit (~10⁻²¹ J/operation at room temperature) is far below current transistor energy use, but advancing AI workloads may push hardware closer to this boundary.

2. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - **Memory Overhead**: Storing computation history for reversible operations increases memory usage, complicating efficiency trade-offs.  
   - **Heat from Existing Hardware**: Resistance in modern chips and persistent storage (e.g., SSDs) generates heat during read/write cycles, undermining potential energy savings.  
   - **Hardware Redesign**: Truly reversible systems require new low-heat transistors (e.g., CMOS successors or optical components), which remain underdeveloped.  

3. **Quantum Computing Connection**:  
   - Quantum computers inherently use reversible logic gates, aligning with reversible computing principles. However, classical reversible systems face skepticism about practicality compared to quantum advancements.  

4. **Machine Learning Applications**:  
   - Techniques like invertible neural networks (e.g., Normalizing Flows) and differentiable simulations already leverage reversible computation for tasks like generative modeling. Workshops and research (e.g., 2019-2021 Invertible Neural Networks workshops) highlight interest in energy-efficient ML architectures.  

5. **Skepticism & Counterpoints**:  
   - Some users question if energy savings would follow due to **Jevons paradox** (efficiency leading to increased usage) or unresolved hardware issues (e.g., heat from non-reversible components).  
   - Reversible matrix operations and reversible algorithms were debated, with users noting that even "reversible" steps may still lose information indirectly.  

6. **Theoretical vs. Real-World**:  
   - While reversible systems could theoretically consume no energy when idle, real-world implementations require power to maintain state, especially in classical architectures. Quantum systems, however, may better achieve near-zero energy computation.  

**Conclusion**: The consensus acknowledges reversible computing’s theoretical promise but emphasizes significant hurdles in hardware innovation and system design. Researchers remain optimistic about long-term potential, particularly for sustainable AI, but stress that breakthroughs in materials science and component engineering are prerequisites for meaningful progress.
