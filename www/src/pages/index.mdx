### Overcoming the limits of current LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://seanpedersen.github.io/posts/overcoming-llm-limits) | 112 points | by [sean_pedersen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sean_pedersen) | [105 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40991549)

Today on Hacker News, a post delves into the limitations of large language models (LLMs) that have been dominating the field. These models, while impressive, face issues like hallucinations, lack of confidence estimates, and citations. Hallucinations occur when the content generated by LLMs sounds convincing but is actually inaccurate—something we definitely want to avoid. Lack of confidence estimates can make it hard to determine the reliability of predictions, while citations are crucial for verifying information sources.

The post highlights a recent release by OpenAI that focuses on teaching models to express uncertainty in words, offering a possible solution to the confidence estimate problem. Additionally, techniques such as RAG (retrieval-augmented generation) can be used to incorporate citations into LLM outputs, creating more reliable content. Several resources like perplexity.ai and wikichat.genie.stanford.edu are mentioned as good examples in this regard.

One interesting approach suggested in the post is the idea of "consistency bootstrapping" for LLMs. By excluding contradictory training data and training the model to identify logical inconsistencies within the context provided, researchers hope to create more reliable and accurate models. MIT researchers have already made strides in this area, as outlined in a paper referenced in the post.

By curating high-quality training data and building models based on consistent worldviews, it may be possible to mitigate the limitations currently faced by LLMs. The proposed approach of gradually expanding training data with consistent text documents offers a promising pathway for improving these powerful language models.

The post provides a wealth of references and resources for those interested in exploring these topics further. It's exciting to see the ongoing efforts to enhance LLM performance and accuracy in text generation tasks.

### Invalid SMILES beneficial rather than detrimental to chemical language models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00821-x) | 6 points | by [Bluestein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bluestein) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40980639)

The latest research in the field of generative machine learning models reveals a surprising discovery - the ability to produce invalid outputs is actually beneficial to chemical language models. Contrary to popular belief, the generation of invalid SMILES strings serves as a self-corrective mechanism that filters out low-likelihood samples, ultimately improving the model's performance. Enforcing valid outputs, on the other hand, can lead to structural biases in the generated molecules, hindering distribution learning and limiting generalization to new chemical spaces.

This new perspective challenges the prevailing assumption that invalid outputs are a flaw in chemical language models and instead presents them as a feature that enhances model functionality. By embracing the presence of invalid outputs, these models are better equipped to explore the vast and complex landscape of chemical space, potentially leading to the discovery of novel molecules with unique properties.

The study highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of model outputs and sheds light on how embracing imperfections can actually improve overall performance in the realm of chemical language models.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission focuses on the idea that allowing the generation of invalid outputs in chemical language models may actually benefit the model's performance. Users Grimblewald and Bluestein engage in a conversation about the importance of including unlikely or conditional instances in the model's output. Grimblewald argues that removing extremely unlikely instances would prevent the model from capturing extreme rare instances, leading to a limited distribution learning capability. Bluestein agrees with Grimblewald, emphasizing that considering unlikely conditions can lead to interesting results and enhance model performance. Overall, the discussion underlines the significance of accounting for imperfections and unlikely scenarios in chemical language models to achieve better outcomes.
