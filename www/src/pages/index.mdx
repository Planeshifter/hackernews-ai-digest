### How can AI researchers save energy? By going backward

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-can-ai-researchers-save-energy-by-going-backward-20250530/) | 62 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44155391)

Researchers exploring the energy-saving promise of reversible computing are revisiting an old idea that initially seemed like a dead end: running programs backward. Originally championed by IBM physicist Rolf Landauer, who linked information processing with thermodynamics, reversible computing aims to avoid energy waste by not deleting data. However, it was Charles Bennett, a colleague of Landauer's, who revolutionized the concept in 1973 with his idea of "uncomputation." This technique allows calculations to be undone, thereby preserving energy but initially proved impractical due to performance issues.

Fast forward to now, as computing demands, particularly from AI applications, increase and conventional chip improvements stall due to physical limitations, the idea of reversible computing is gaining fresh interest. By carefully orchestrating operations to avoid any loss of information, therefore no energy is lost as heat, this could pave the way for highly efficient computing systems. Research continues into making these computers feasible, with tweaks largely focused on balancing the trade-offs between memory usage, computation time, and energy savings.

With AI's vast energy consumption, such innovation could lead to breakthroughs, sustaining progress diversified approaches like light-based chips are also being considered. However, achieving significant energy savings through reversible computing will necessitate new designs for low-heat transistors from the outset. Efforts by engineers at MIT and elsewhere are underway to configure these machines to fulfill their energy-efficient promise, potentially taking us a step closer to sustainable AI systems.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Reversible Computing:**

The discussion around reversible computing explores its theoretical promise and practical challenges, with contributions from users diving into thermodynamics, hardware limitations, and applications in AI and quantum computing. Key points include:

1. **Thermodynamics & Landauer’s Principle**:  
   - Deleting information is inherently irreversible and generates heat, per Landauer’s principle. Reversible computing avoids this by preserving data, theoretically minimizing energy waste. However, real-world hardware (e.g., NAND gates, resistive components) still dissipate heat, limiting practical gains.  
   - Landauer’s limit (~10⁻²¹ J/operation at room temperature) is far below current transistor energy use, but advancing AI workloads may push hardware closer to this boundary.

2. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - **Memory Overhead**: Storing computation history for reversible operations increases memory usage, complicating efficiency trade-offs.  
   - **Heat from Existing Hardware**: Resistance in modern chips and persistent storage (e.g., SSDs) generates heat during read/write cycles, undermining potential energy savings.  
   - **Hardware Redesign**: Truly reversible systems require new low-heat transistors (e.g., CMOS successors or optical components), which remain underdeveloped.  

3. **Quantum Computing Connection**:  
   - Quantum computers inherently use reversible logic gates, aligning with reversible computing principles. However, classical reversible systems face skepticism about practicality compared to quantum advancements.  

4. **Machine Learning Applications**:  
   - Techniques like invertible neural networks (e.g., Normalizing Flows) and differentiable simulations already leverage reversible computation for tasks like generative modeling. Workshops and research (e.g., 2019-2021 Invertible Neural Networks workshops) highlight interest in energy-efficient ML architectures.  

5. **Skepticism & Counterpoints**:  
   - Some users question if energy savings would follow due to **Jevons paradox** (efficiency leading to increased usage) or unresolved hardware issues (e.g., heat from non-reversible components).  
   - Reversible matrix operations and reversible algorithms were debated, with users noting that even "reversible" steps may still lose information indirectly.  

6. **Theoretical vs. Real-World**:  
   - While reversible systems could theoretically consume no energy when idle, real-world implementations require power to maintain state, especially in classical architectures. Quantum systems, however, may better achieve near-zero energy computation.  

**Conclusion**: The consensus acknowledges reversible computing’s theoretical promise but emphasizes significant hurdles in hardware innovation and system design. Researchers remain optimistic about long-term potential, particularly for sustainable AI, but stress that breakthroughs in materials science and component engineering are prerequisites for meaningful progress.

In an exciting announcement from OpenAI, they're taking the Codex CLI up a notch by transitioning it to a native Rust implementation. This shift is part of their efforts to refine the tool's cross-platform stability, security, performance, and extensibility. The original Codex CLI, initially developed using Node.js and React-based Ink, provided a quick and interactive terminal UI. However, to optimize performance and offer a zero-dependency install, the team is now leveraging Rust's strengths.

Why Rust? Well, it's about picking the right tool for the job. Rust eliminates the need for runtime garbage collection, thereby reducing memory consumption. It also brings native security bindings for Linux sandboxing to the table—an intriguing feature that’s already partly in place thanks to available Rust bindings.

OpenAI is not just stopping at a Rust makeover. They’re enhancing Codex with a wire protocol to allow developers to extend its functionalities across different languages, including TypeScript, Python, and more. This makes Codex not just a robust tool but a versatile one.

While the team continues squashing bugs in the TypeScript version, they're hard at work aligning the Rust implementation with the current features. Contributions from the developer community have been key to this transition, and OpenAI is calling for more enthusiasts to join their journey. If you're someone who thrives on Rust development and agentic coding, this could be your chance to jump into a dynamic project.

OpenAI expresses gratitude to all contributors for their input so far, and they’re reaching out for more hands on deck as they pave the way to make the Rust-based Codex CLI the default experience. Want to be part of this innovative shift? The Codex team is open to fresh ideas and talents at codex-maintainers@openai.com.

Intrigued by the security aspect? Stay tuned for more detailed insights into Codex's handling of sandboxing and other exciting developments!

### Why DeepSeek is cheap at scale but expensive to run locally

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/inference-batching-and-deepseek/) | 318 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [211 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44149238)

DeepSeek-V3 is reportedly both fast and cheap when served at scale, yet it remains cumbersome and costly for local runs. This paradox is a common theme in the world of AI models, where a fundamental tradeoff exists between throughput and latency. Essentially, models like DeepSeek-V3 are configured such that they excel when handling numerous requests simultaneously but slow down significantly for isolated ones.

The crux of this tradeoff lies in how AI service providers choose to batch requests. Rather than process each user request individually, many systems batch dozens or even thousands of requests together. This batch processing takes advantage of the capabilities of GPUs, which are incredibly efficient at handling large matrix multiplications in one go. Processing a batch of requests can be nearly as fast as fulfilling just one due to GPU optimization, which can handle a substantial matrix multiplication task in one swift motion, avoiding the overhead of issuing multiple commands and swapping data in and out of memory.

This batching allows for remarkable throughput—essentially, the model can churn through more data in less time. However, it also introduces a delay for each user request while it waits for a batch to fill, increasing latency. This is why some models, particularly those based on transformers like DeepSeek-V3, may seem slow when kicked off but accelerate significantly once processes are running in parallel.

An illustrative facet of this is the use of "collection windows" by AI servers, which aggregate requests over a brief timeframe before processing them together. The window size can vary—ranging from 5 milliseconds to possibly 200 milliseconds—depending on the desired balance of throughput and latency. Short windows lead to quicker responses for individuals but potentially underutilize GPU capacity. In contrast, longer windows maximize utilization by collecting more requests, thus ensuring that the heavy-duty matrix multiplications are as large and efficient as possible.

For specific models, like mixture-of-experts architectures, this batching is not just an optimization but a necessity. These models consist of myriad smaller computations that, if processed piecemeal, would severely underutilize GPU capabilities. By collecting larger batches, the system ensures that each "expert" involved has enough data to process efficiently, reducing the number of small, inefficient computations.

In summary, DeepSeek-V3 and similar models are designed to leverage the innate strengths of GPUs to achieve high throughput at the expense of latency for individual requests. This makes them ideal for large scale deployments but less suited for localized, single-instance tasks.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and trade-offs of running large AI models like DeepSeek-V3 locally, with a focus on hardware setups, quantization methods, performance benchmarks, and cost debates.

### Key Points:
1. **Local Hardware Configurations**:  
   - Users shared setups using high-end server-grade hardware (e.g., EPYC 9004 CPUs, 384GB RAM) to run DeepSeek-V3 locally. However, even with such powerful systems, limitations like GPU power draw, RAM constraints, and latency issues persist.  
   - Some achieved modest speeds (~7 tokens/sec with 16k context) using quantization techniques like **Unsloth’s Dynamic GGUF**, though performance varied significantly with context length and model size.  

2. **Quantization and Optimization**:  
   - **Unsloth’s Dynamic GGUF** was highlighted for improving inference efficiency, with claims of near-FP8 precision and compatibility with CPU offloading for memory-heavy tasks. Benchmarks showed accuracy improvements (+1% to +10%) for models like Llama and Gemma after quantization.  
   - Debate arose over real-world performance versus theoretical benchmarks, with some users noting minimal perceptible quality differences between quantized and full models for tasks like summarization or coding.

3. **Performance vs. Cost**:  
   - A $4,000 local setup was criticized as expensive despite the article’s emphasis on affordability, sparking discussions about the practicality of CPU-only inference versus GPU-accelerated solutions.  
   - Comparisons were drawn to cloud providers, where users noted slower speeds (5-10x) but lower upfront costs, though latency for large-context tasks (e.g., 32k tokens) remained a pain point.  

4. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **KV caching** and prompt processing bottlenecks were discussed, with quadratic complexity in attention mechanisms causing delays for long contexts. Some users suggested optimizations like splitting prompts or using memory-efficient frameworks.  
   - Skepticism emerged around CPU-only setups, with arguments that GPUs (e.g., RTX 4090, H100) are essential for interactive use, as even high-end server CPUs struggle with real-time responsiveness.  

5. **Divergent Opinions**:  
   - Enthusiasts praised local deployment for control and privacy, while others deemed it impractical for most users, advocating instead for cloud-based solutions or smaller models (e.g., Gemma 27B) as a balance between performance and resource use.  

### Conclusion:  
The thread underscores the tension between scalability and accessibility in AI deployment. While advancements in quantization and hardware enable local runs of models like DeepSeek-V3, significant trade-offs in cost, speed, and usability persist, reinforcing the divide between large-scale efficiency and individual practicality.

---

### **Key Discussion Points**

#### **Benchmark Validity and Scalability**
- **Controversial Comparisons**: Users questioned the fairness of comparing RenderFormer (76ms on an A100 GPU) to Blender Cycles (397s), noting that Cycles used a much higher sample count (4096 samples/pixel vs. RenderFormer’s 512x512 training). Critics argued this misrepresents real-world performance and fails to account for Blender’s scene-instantiation overhead.
- **Scalability Concerns**: RenderFormer’s quadratic scaling with triangles/pixels was flagged as a limitation. While promising for small scenes (e.g., 4096 triangles), it may struggle with complex scenes (millions of triangles) where traditional path tracers (with linear scaling) excel.

#### **Hardware Relevance**
- **A100 vs. Consumer GPUs**: Skepticism arose about using enterprise-level A100 GPUs for comparison. Participants highlighted that consumer-grade RTX cards (e.g., RTX 4090) with dedicated ray-tracing cores are more relevant for designers but were absent in benchmarks.

#### **Technical Trade-offs**
- **Denoising and Artifacts**: Users observed RenderFormer’s output had AI-typical smoothness, raising concerns about lost texture detail. Traditional denoisers (e.g., in Blender) were seen as more mature for handling noise at low sample counts.
- **Algorithmic Efficiency**: While RenderFormer avoids ray tracing, its transformer-based approach might not surpass the asymptotic efficiency of path tracing, especially for high-frequency details like complex shadows or reflections.

#### **Use-Case Practicality**
- **Preview vs. Final Renders**: Many saw RenderFormer as a tool for rapid previews (e.g., 3D design drafts) rather than final frames. Its speed could benefit iterative workflows but not replace high-quality, sample-intensive renders for production.
- **Industry Adoption**: Comments noted RenderFormer is a research milestone, but industry adoption would require solving scalability and integration with existing pipelines. Traditional renderers still dominate VFX/film due to precision and robustness.

#### **Miscellaneous**
- **SIGGRAPH Hype?**: Some users linked the paper’s framing to academic conference trends, cautioning against overhyping early-stage techniques.
- **Request for Clarification**: Calls for transparent benchmarks (sample counts, hardware, scene complexity) to better contextualize results.

---

### **TL;DR**
The Hacker News community expressed cautious optimism about RenderFormer’s novel approach but critiqued its benchmarks as misleading, questioned scalability for complex scenes, and highlighted the impracticality of A100-based comparisons. While seen as a leap forward for rapid prototyping, it’s not yet a replacement for established renderers like Blender Cycles in high-quality or industrial contexts.

### Using lots of little tools to aggressively reject the bots

#### [Submission URL](https://lambdacreate.com/posts/68) | 203 points | by [archargelod](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=archargelod) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44142761)

In a heartfelt blog entry, a server owner describes a recent challenge with bot invasions overwhelming their small corner of the internet. Initially delighted at the prospect of visitors, they soon discovered these weren't the kind of guests you'd want at your digital doorstep. Large corporations, including Amazon, Facebook, and OpenAI, were among the culprits, relentlessly scraping data for self-serving purposes. This rise in data voracity, fuelled by the explosion in AI development, put significant strain on the server's infrastructure.

Named Vignere, the server faced increasing CPU and memory demands, and its disk, running vital services like Zabbix and Gitea, filled rapidly. Attempts to set aggressive cleanup tasks proved insufficient. The unexpected surge in requests—peaking at 20+ per second—was far more than the usual 8-per-second traffic the site typically managed. This tenfold increase sent operational metrics haywire, leading to disruptions in daily functions such as git operations and chat services.

To tackle the issue, the author relied on their systems administration prowess. Out-of-band monitoring systems like Zabbix provided crucial historical data to pinpoint the anomaly amidst chaos. Yet, the real eye-opener came from analyzing nginx requests and network throughput, which highlighted the stark difference between normal and siege-like conditions.

With a sysadmin's toolkit at their disposal, the author began untangling the mess. Temporarily shutting down containers and disabling the nginx server allowed for a proper investigation into server logs, laying groundwork for future defense against unwelcome digital guests. Though disillusioned by this unwelcome deluge, the narrative emphasizes the importance of being prepared, and resilient, in the face of relentless data bots.

The Hacker News discussion on a blog post about battling bot invasions reveals a mix of technical troubleshooting, debates over ethical scraping practices, and skepticism about countermeasures. Key points include:

### Technical Challenges & Solutions  
- **Traffic Management**: Users note that while 20 requests/second is manageable for static content, dynamic pages (e.g., Git operations) or large file downloads can overwhelm small servers. Solutions like aggressive caching, CDNs (Cloudflare, S3), and optimizing server configurations are suggested to mitigate bandwidth and CPU strain.  
- **Cost vs. Scaling**: Some commenters highlight the expense of scaling infrastructure (e.g., FPGA-based systems, dedicated CDNs) for high-traffic scenarios, while others argue small sites could optimize inexpensively with static content and proper caching.  

### Ethical & Legal Concerns  
- **Scraping for AI**: Many criticize AI companies (e.g., OpenAI) for disregarding `robots.txt` and scraping data without consent, often for commercial gain. Ethical concerns arise about "knowledge hoarding" and the lack of compensation for original content creators.  
- **Legal Grey Areas**: The EU’s GDPR and similar regulations are seen as potential tools to combat abusive scraping, though enforcement is debated. However, users doubt legal action’s practicality against large corporations.  

### Effectiveness of Countermeasures  
- **`robots.txt` Futility**: Scrapers, particularly AI-driven ones, often ignore `robots.txt`, rendering it ineffective. Technical measures like IP blocklists, rate-limiting, and serving "poisoned" data (e.g., decompression bombs) are proposed alternatives.  
- **Bot Detection Challenges**: Distinguishing bots from legitimate users is difficult, with some advocating for more aggressive client-side checks (e.g., JavaScript challenges), though these can complicate access for real users.  

### Community Sentiment  
- **Cynicism vs. Pragmatism**: While some dismiss the blog’s concerns as overblown (comparing traffic to “grandparents using LED lights”), others empathize with the strain sudden bot surges place on hobbyist setups.  
- **Big Tech Accountability**: Criticisms target firms like Google and Semrush for ignoring scraper etiquette, highlighting a power imbalance between small server owners and corporate data harvesters.  

In summary, the thread reflects a blend of technical advice, frustration with unethical scraping practices, and resigned acceptance that small-scale operators face uphill battles against resource-rich entities. Solutions range from tactical server optimizations to broader calls for regulatory intervention, though few see easy resolutions.

Dive into the world of artistic AI with "turtlesim_agent," a fascinating open-source project that turns the classic ROS turtlesim simulator into a creative digital artist, all driven by natural language. Crafted by Yutarop, this project leverages LangChain to interpret text instructions and morphs them into beautiful visual drawings, effectively transforming instruction-based language into art.

Have you ever wanted to direct a turtle to draw a rainbow with specific colors and dimensions just by chatting to it? At the heart of turtlesim_agent is an AI capable of reasoning through natural language prompts to translate them into motion commands for the turtle, leveraging the powerful synergy of large language models with environmental controls.

What makes this project even cooler is its adaptability. Whether you're using OpenAI, Cohere, or Google for processing language, the versatility of LangChain allows turtlesim_agent to hook seamlessly into various model providers. The project also capitalizes on the flexibility and robustness of ROS 2 Humble Hawksbill, ensuring a stable development environment for both novices and seasoned developers.

Setting it up? It's straightforward. Once you've got your ROS 2 environment ready and dependencies installed, configure your API keys for the preferred language model services. And for those keen on digging deeper, there’s built-in support for tracing with LangSmith to better understand agent behavior. 

Tailor your experience by choosing which language model the agent should use, from "gemini-2.0-flash" to perhaps something like "gpt-4." With detailed instructions for customizing these settings within `turtlesim_node.py` and `turtlesim_agent.launch.xml`, users can effortlessly pivot to their preferred models.

Choose between a CLI or GUI chat interface based on your interaction preference—CLI for dissecting the agent’s logic and GUI for a more interactive experience. With tools in place for streamlined operations, tinkerers and artists alike can guide this AI agent to create a myriad of visual outputs.

Jump into this creative journey with the turtlesim_agent and witness the intersection of AI and art in a playful, dynamic way right from the comfort of your development setup.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Agent Workflow Clarification:**  
   - Users explored how the `turtlesim_agent` translates high-level prompts into actions. The creator clarified that the LLM (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini) interprets the user’s intent in *a single call*, breaking tasks into subtasks (e.g., "draw a rainbow" → move forward, change pen color). These steps are then executed via modular Python functions. The LLM doesn’t directly control ROS commands but orchestrates predefined tools like `publish_velocity()`.

2. **Nostalgia for Logo Programming:**  
   - One user likened the project to the vintage **Logo programming language**, recalling childhood experiences with its turtle graphics system. They praised the AI-driven evolution of this concept for modern creative and educational uses.

3. **Physics vs. Digital Art:**  
   - A question arose about simulating real-world physics (e.g., turtle momentum). The creator clarified that `turtlesim` skips physics for simplicity, enabling instant teleportation or velocity commands to focus on digital artistry rather than realism.

4. **Broader Applications of LLM + ROS:**  
   - Users highlighted potential real-world integrations, like LLMs guiding robots for tasks (e.g., fetching items via semantic maps) or handling error recovery (e.g., diagnosing ROS system crashes). The creator shared plans to expand into **TurtleBot3** with LiDAR/object detection for context-aware decision-making.

5. **Enthusiasm & Future Directions:**  
   - The community praised the project’s creativity and discussed the "middleware" role of agents in bridging natural language and robotics. Anticipation was expressed for more complex use cases (e.g., 3D navigation) leveraging LLMs’ reasoning alongside traditional robotics frameworks.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion blends technical depth (agent architecture, physics trade-offs) with nostalgia and excitement for AI’s role in democratizing robotics and art. Users envision a future where LLMs act as high-level orchestrators for robots, blending creativity with practical applications.
