### Ts_zip: Text Compression Using Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://bellard.org/ts_server/ts_zip.html) | 240 points | by [Deeg9rie9usi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Deeg9rie9usi) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37152978)

The ts_zip utility in the ts_server software has introduced a new way to compress text files using Large Language Models. Unlike other compression tools, ts_zip achieves significantly higher compression ratios. However, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. Firstly, the language model needs to be available during decompression. Additionally, a GPU is necessary to achieve reasonable speeds, and it's crucial to use the same GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression. 

The compression ratio for each model is measured in bits per byte. CMIX v19 is particularly impressive in terms of compression. The table provided shows the compression ratios for various files, including alice29.txt, book1, enwik8, and linux-1.2.13.tar.

When compressing the book1 file on an RTX A6000 GPU, the compression speed and required GPU memory are measured. Interestingly, the decompression speed and memory requirements are similar. Different models, such as rwkv_169M, rwkv_430M, pythia_deduped_70M, rwkv_7B_q4, and falcon_7B_q4, are compared in terms of compression speed and GPU memory usage.

In conclusion, the smaller RWKV models seem to strike a good balance for text compression. They utilize less memory due to their RNN structure and offer relatively high compression speeds. Fabrice Bellard, the developer behind ts_zip, is the mastermind behind this innovative text compression utility.

The discussion surrounding the ts_zip utility focuses on various aspects of text compression using Large Language Models (LLMs). Some comments discuss the potential limitations and challenges of using LLMs for compression. One user points out that the models require the availability of the language model during decompression, and another highlights the need for a compatible GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression.

### Bayesian Flow Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037) | 81 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37134315)

A new paper titled "Bayesian Flow Networks" introduces a new class of generative models called Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs). BFNs modify the parameters of independent distributions using Bayesian inference based on noisy data samples. These modified parameters are then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. This generative procedure is similar to the reverse process of diffusion models but simpler since no forward process is required. The paper derives discrete and continuous-time loss functions for different types of data and proposes sample generation procedures. BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling and outperform existing discrete diffusion models on a character-level language modeling task. The network inputs for discrete data are on the probability simplex, making it possible to use gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains like language modeling. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### What coal and Jevonsâ€™ paradox tell us about AI and data

#### [Submission URL](https://hex.tech/blog/jevons-paradox-demand-for-insight/) | 70 points | by [erehweb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erehweb) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129853)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the future of data jobs. Will computers replace human data practitioners? According to a blog post by Barry McCardel, the job of a data practitioner is more than just writing code or making charts. It involves formulating the right questions, anticipating the needs of stakeholders, and providing valuable insights. While AI can automate certain rote tasks, it is unlikely to replace the human element of data work.

McCardel draws a parallel to Jevons' Paradox, which observed that as coal-powered engines became more efficient, overall coal consumption increased. The same rebound effect could apply to AI and data. As the cost of generating insights decreases, the demand for data work and the number of questions that can be answered with data will likely increase. Organizations are supply-constrained when it comes to utilizing data, and AI can help unlock the untapped potential of data teams.

While AI will undoubtedly change how data practitioners work, McCardel argues that it will likely lead to an increased need for human hours rather than a decrease. The impact of data on organizations is far from reaching its theoretical limit, and AI can help data teams be more impactful. McCardel concludes by discussing Hex, a platform that enables the creation and sharing of interactive data products, and invites readers to explore opportunities with the company.

Overall, the blog post highlights the potential of AI to augment rather than replace human data practitioners, and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's main points about AI and the future of data jobs. One commenter agrees with the post, saying that AI may take over low-value tasks but will not replace the higher-level strategic work that humans can do. They argue that as technology progresses, there is a shift in the types of jobs available. Another commenter brings up the concern that AI may replace non-essential service vendors and result in organizational changes. 

There is also a discussion about the impact of automation on different types of jobs. Some argue that AI will lead to an increase in the need for human hours rather than a decrease. Others point out that certain jobs, like manual labor, may be more easily replaced by automation, while others believe that higher-skilled jobs will still be in demand. The potential impact on the middle class is also mentioned.

Another comment highlights the importance of natural language communication, social and emotional intelligence, and decision-making in certain professions, suggesting that AI may not fully replace these roles. However, another commenter challenges this notion, stating that AI has the potential to approximate decision-makers and replace jobs traditionally done by lower-skilled workers. They argue that humans are not horses and will adapt to new roles.

There is also a discussion about the current and future job market and the creation of new roles. Some argue that the current job market is not representative of the future, and there is uncertainty about the impact of AI on employment. Others discuss the changing dynamics in households and the increase in multiple jobs held by individuals.
