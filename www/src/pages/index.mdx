#### [Submission URL](https://metr.org/blog/2025-07-10-early-2025-ai-experienced-os-dev-study/) | 668 points | by [dheerajvs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dheerajvs) | [435 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44522772)

In a surprising turn of events for tech enthusiasts and developers alike, a new study reveals that early-2025 AI tools may be slowing down experienced open-source developers rather than speeding them up. Conducted by a research team, the randomized controlled trial (RCT) initially aimed to evaluate how AI impacts developer productivity when working on their own repositories. The study found that developers using AI tools took 19% longer to complete tasks compared to working without them.

This unexpected finding challenges developer beliefs and expert forecasts, as many anticipated AI would enhance speed by 24%. Even after experiencing prolonged working times, developers still believed AI had improved their efficiency by 20%. This gap between perception and reality suggests a complex relationship between AI and developer productivity that warrants further exploration.

The study involved 16 skilled developers working on prominent open-source projects, handling real and valuable issues like bug fixes and feature updates. These developers, who could opt to use AI such as the Cursor Pro with Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet models, were compensated $150/hr for their participation.

Despite optimistic projections and anecdotal evidence suggesting AI's helpfulness, the RCT's findings underscore the discrepancy between AI’s theoretical potential and its real-world application, specifically in software development. The research highlights that while AI capabilities have been frequently overestimated, actual implementation can be slowed down by factors that the study investigates, shedding light on the nuanced nature of AI integration into developer workflows.

The study does not imply that AI lacks potential across all domains of software development, nor does it forecast future AI growth negatively. Instead, it opens up discussions on how developers and AI tools can better harmonize to unlock true productivity gains. As AI technologies rapidly evolve, continuous assessments like this study will be crucial to navigating AI's impact on the industry's landscape. For a detailed exploration, readers are invited to delve into the full paper, which provides a comprehensive analysis of the trial's results and the methodology behind it.

The Hacker News discussion highlights several key debates and perspectives surrounding the study's findings that AI tools may slow experienced developers:

1. **Mixed Results & Learning Curves**  
   Participants note the study's RCT methodology and mixed outcomes, with ~25% of developers improving performance while others slowed down. Some argue AI tools like Cursor require significant experience (e.g., 50+ hours) to yield benefits, emphasizing steep learning curves that conflict with "instant productivity" expectations.

2. **Workflow Disruption vs. Adaptation**  
   Developers compare AI adoption to historical tool shifts (e.g., Git, IDEs), noting initial productivity loss when adapting to new workflows. Critics argue AI disrupts deeply ingrained practices, while proponents suggest long-term gains require rethinking processes, similar to mastering version control or debuggers.

3. **Hype vs. Reality**  
   Skeptics criticize marketing overhype around LLMs, arguing tools are often poorly designed for real-world tasks. Others counter that genuine positive experiences (e.g., in forums like HN) validate AI's potential, though success depends on implementation quality and user expertise.

4. **Tool Philosophy Debates**  
   Side discussions reference "IDE wars," comparing veterans' pride in complex tools (Vim/Emacs) to modern VS Code's accessibility. Some suggest AI tools might follow this trajectory—initially cumbersome but eventually indispensable with refinements.

5. **Humorous Meta-Commentary**  
   Jokes liken Linus Torvalds testifying to Congress about Git's dangers, highlighting how transformative tools reshape workflows, sometimes painfully. Others quip about developers' insistence on using outdated tools due to sunk cost or identity.

Overall, the dialogue reflects tension between optimism about AI's potential and skepticism about current tool maturity, stressing the need for balanced expectations, better tool design, and acknowledgment of learning curves akin to past tech shifts.

### AI coding tools can reduce productivity

#### [Submission URL](https://secondthoughts.ai/p/ai-coding-slowdown) | 241 points | by [gk1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gk1) | [231 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44526912)

In a surprising turn, a recent METR study challenges the hype surrounding AI coding tools, revealing that their impact on productivity might not be as positive as expected. Contrary to popular belief, the study found that experienced developers working on mature projects experienced a 19% decrease in productivity when using AI coding tools. Despite the developers' own expectations that AI would boost their productivity by 20%, the findings suggest otherwise.

The study, conducted through a rigorous randomized controlled trial, involved 16 developers from major open-source projects who tackled 246 coding tasks. Each task was randomly designated as either "AI Allowed" or "AI Disallowed," with time estimates made prior to knowing whether AI could be used. Astonishingly, it turned out that AI tools didn't speed things up but actually caused a slowdown compared to tasks where AI wasn't used.

Importantly, even though the study wasn't blinded, researchers accounted for numerous potential biases and alternate explanations. They ruled out the "John Henry Effect," where developers might work harder to outperform the machine, as well as the possibility of developers not fully utilizing AI tools. Analysis showed substantial AI use, yet the productivity drop persisted.

While this study should not be seen as dismissing the potential benefits of AI tools entirely, it does caution against overly optimistic claims of their effectiveness, especially for seasoned developers handling complex projects. The findings highlight the nuanced role AI plays in coding and suggest that the true impact of AI on productivity might still need fine-tuning and a better understanding of where it fits in the developer's toolkit.

The discussion surrounding the METR study on AI coding tools reveals several key themes:

### Skepticism Towards AI Tools
- Participants expressed doubt about AI's effectiveness, noting it often complicates problem-solving rather than simplifying it. Users cited instances where AI-generated code answers were misleading or required corrections, contradicting expectations of time savings (*Fraterkes*, *aleph_minus_one*).
- Developers highlighted AI's failure to address flawed assumptions. For example, debugging tasks saw AI tools missing fundamental errors in queries, leading users to manually diagnose issues (*Tainnor*, *SamPatt*).

### Preference for Traditional Methods
- Many users preferred conventional resources like Google, Stack Overflow, or documentation over AI tools. AI was seen as unreliable for nuanced or complex tasks, particularly in mature projects (*aleph_minus_one*, *dggn*).
- Personal anecdotes emphasized frustration with AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) producing "complete garbage" or incorrect code, eroding trust (*rsnhm*).

### Productivity Measurement Challenges
- Debates arose over how to measure developer productivity, likening it to quantifying professions like doctors or lawyers. Metrics like lines of code or GitHub commits were criticized as oversimplified or easily manipulated (*jrdklws*, *grmp*, *analog31*).
- Some argued productivity metrics inherently fail to capture creative or collaborative work, leading to flawed comparisons (*Ma8ee*, *tmcm*).

### Mixed Experiences with AI
- While AI tools were deemed useful for *approximations* in simple tasks (e.g., generating diagrams or boilerplate code), they struggled with hard problems requiring deep expertise. Users noted AI often requires manual tweaking (*whtgrtby*, *dnlbln*).
- A subset of developers acknowledged niche successes, such as using LLMs to explore specific coding roadblocks, but this remained inconsistent (*dggn*).

### Broader Critique of Metrics
- Parallel discussions criticized industries (e.g., healthcare, education) for relying on reductive productivity metrics, arguing they incentivize "gaming the system" over meaningful outcomes (*grmp*, *AllegedAlec*).

### Conclusion
The discussion underscores skepticism about AI’s current utility for expert developers, emphasizes the irreplaceability of human problem-solving in complex scenarios, and critiques the broader challenge of defining productivity in technical fields. While AI shows promise for trivial tasks, its integration into sophisticated workflows remains contentious.

### Is Gemini 2.5 good at bounding boxes?

#### [Submission URL](https://simedw.com/2025/07/10/gemini-bounding-boxes/) | 274 points | by [simedw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simedw) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44520292)

The latest exploration into Gemini 2.5 Pro's capabilities reveals that while it can hold its ground in object detection, it's not quite ready to overthrow established CNNs like Yolo V3. Equipped with the allure of avoiding exhaustive dataset prep, the researcher embarked on a journey to compare Gemini's prowess on the venerable MS-COCO benchmark.

For context, MS-COCO is a classic, albeit somewhat aged, dataset famous for its 80-object classes including everything from people to toothbrushes. Gemini 2.5 matched YOLO V3's performance from 2018, clocking a respectable 0.34 mean Average Precision (mAP)—slightly higher than YOLO's ~0.33—but it’s still far from top-tier models like Co-DETR which boast ~0.60 mAP.

Testing involved feeding Gemini prompts with embedded MS-COCO class lists but without explicitly naming the dataset, to ensure unbiased evaluation. It undertook various token "thinking budgets" with structured and unstructured output, revealing that Gemini Pro's structured mode with a 1024-token budget performed best.

The researcher's quest also included attempts to improve bounding box accuracy by including mask outputs, although the impact turned out to be negligible. 

Ultimately, Gemini 2.5 Pro delivers competent object detection without redefining the landscape. Meanwhile, state-of-the-art models continue to outpace it, proving there's still room for CNNs in the spotlight. The code and more results are accessible for those inclined to explore further into Gemini's object detection trials.

**Summary of Discussion:**

   - Debate on whether **multimodal LLMs** (Gemini) can match dedicated vision models due to post-training vs. native architectural alignment.  
   - Some argue Gemini’s “thinking budget” (structured token outputs) and tight coupling of language/vision representations benefit detection tasks, but it still lags behind SOTA CNNs/transformers.

3. **Practical Application Challenges**:  
   - **PDF parsing**: Users report mixed results using Gemini for bounding boxes in scanned PDFs (e.g., Sanskrit texts), where coordinate offsets and tokenization artifacts complicate accuracy. Workarounds like iterative prompting are described as “flaky.”  
   - **Ground truth debates**: Skepticism about MS-COCO’s labels being treated as “perfect” ground truth, with users pointing to labeling inconsistencies (e.g., address parsing errors) and questioning whether benchmarks reflect real-world accuracy.

4. **Emerging Tools and Alternatives**:  
   - Mentions of newer models (Qwen-VL, VLM1) and frameworks like [LLM Delegation](https://calibratedresearch.google) for object detection tasks.  
   - Some advocate for hybrid approaches (e.g., using smaller specialized models for segmentation).

5. **Broader Implications for LLMs**:  
   - Discussion on whether **tokenization of images** inherently limits LLMs’ vision capabilities versus dedicated encoders. Users compare Gemini to Claude/OpenAI models, which handle vision via separate modules.  
   - Speculation on future multimodal architectures that natively integrate vision-language processing.

### Notable Quotes:
- *“Gemini feels half like solving the problem and half like generating a solution.”* – On PDF content detection.  
- *“Ground truth isn’t perfect—it’s just a human-labeled approximation.”* – Critiquing MS-COCO’s reliability.  
- *“Why use an LLM for vision? Just call a vision API!”* – Skepticism about Gemini’s role in vision tasks.

### Takeaways:
While Gemini 2.5 Pro shows promise in zero-shot object detection, its practical utility remains limited compared to specialized models. The conversation underscores the importance of **standardized evaluation practices**, **data format consistency**, and hybrid architectures leveraging both LLMs and traditional vision pipelines.

### Async Ruby Is the Future of AI Apps (and It's Already Here)

#### [Submission URL](https://paolino.me/async-ruby-is-the-future/) | 66 points | by [doppp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doppp) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44516555)

In the world of programming, where threading has long been king, Ruby is quietly making waves with async capabilities that may dramatically reshape how we build AI applications. After years deeply entrenched in Python’s asyncio, Carmine Paolino’s return to Ruby felt like a step into the past, where threads still overwhelmingly ruled the ecosystem. Yet, while Ruby had been gently building its async prowess, it wasn’t until Paolino undertook projects like RubyLLM and Chat with Work that the potential of async Ruby—particularly for AI applications—became startlingly clear.

Ruby's async capabilities come to the forefront with large language models (LLMs), which demand handling thousands of concurrent, token-streaming conversations. The limitations of thread-based models quickly become apparent in LLM contexts: inefficient resource use, scalability issues, and increased latency due to threads sitting idle, bottlenecked by their synchronous nature.

Threads, in essence, are like workers sharing an office space, accessing the same resources (or memory) with potential conflicts and significant overhead. Fibers, however, represent a more elegant solution for certain applications. Operating like a single worker managing multiple tasks and voluntarily switching at logical points (such as I/O boundaries), fibers offer efficient concurrency without the heavy overhead of threads.

Why do fibers shine here? Ruby’s Global VM Lock (GVL) only allows one thread to execute Ruby code at any time, negating the advantage of threads for CPU-bound tasks. Instead, threads excel only when dealing with I/O operations. Fibers, through cooperative concurrency handled entirely within user space without kernel involvement, sidestep this GVL limitation. They allow for asynchronous execution within a single thread, efficiently managing I/O-bound tasks—perfect for the demands of LLM interactions where async Ruby truly becomes a game-changer.

Unlike Python, which prompted developers to rework entire stacks to adopt asyncio, Ruby maintains compatibility with existing codebases. This means developers don't face the nightmare of syntax rewrites or library migrations to embrace async functionalities.

In a landscape where threads are burgeoning under the weight of modern AI needs, the async model's sleek efficiency—working at the pace of AI’s future demands—positions Ruby not just as a participant but a potentially powerful leader in the concurrency revolution. As more developers catch on to the promise that async Ruby holds—especially under the stewardship of developers like Samuel Williams—Ruby could very well be the sleeping giant in the future of AI application development.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion around Ruby's async capabilities and their implications for AI development:

### Key Themes & Debates:
- **Fibers vs. Threads**: Ruby's fibers are praised for lightweight, cooperative concurrency (managed in user space), avoiding the Global VM Lock (GVL) bottleneck. Threads are seen as inefficient for high I/O workloads (e.g., LLM token streaming), while fibers handle thousands of concurrent tasks with minimal overhead. However, a counterpoint questions whether threads are overkill for I/O work paired with efficient event loops like `epoll`.

- **Comparison with Python**: Developers note Python’s asyncio requires significant code rewrites, while Ruby’s async integrates seamlessly with existing codebases. Python remains favored for CPU-bound tasks, but Ruby excels in I/O-bound scenarios like concurrent LLM interactions. Critics argue Python’s ecosystem still dominates AI/LLM tooling.

- **Developer Experience**: Ruby’s async syntax and libraries (e.g., `Net::HTTP` compatibility) are lauded for simplicity, allowing runtime type-checking and declarative patterns. Some highlight frustration with Python’s fragmentation in async adoption.

- **Performance & Scalability**: Discussions emphasize connection pooling (e.g., 25 workers maxing PostgreSQL connections vs. fibers scaling to thousands) and hardware efficiency. Skepticism arises about Ruby’s microsecond-level latency and memory management for CPU-heavy tasks.

- **Language Comparisons**: Go’s goroutines and C++’s abstractions are mentioned as alternatives, but Ruby’s fibers are seen as a pragmatic, lightweight solution. A sardonic note compares Ruby/Python async adoption to JavaScript’s async/await evolution.

### Sentiment:
The thread reflects optimism about Ruby’s async potential in AI contexts, especially for I/O-bound workloads, but acknowledges trade-offs in CPU performance and ecosystem maturity. While some advocate Ruby as a "sleeping giant," others stress the need to balance concurrency models and language strengths.
