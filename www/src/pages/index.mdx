In an exciting advancement, researchers at the Liquid Sunlight Alliance (LiSA) have developed a promising new device that could revolutionize energy production by converting sunlight and carbon dioxide into liquid fuels. By using a combination of perovskite materials and copper-based catalysts, the team at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, in collaboration with multiple international institutions, has designed a system that replicates the natural photosynthesis process found in plants, paving the way for sustainable energy solutions.

This innovative device, still at the proof-of-concept stage, successfully transforms carbon dioxide into valuable C2 products—compounds vital for manufacturing everything from jet fuel to plastic polymers. The researchers utilized perovskite solar absorbers to capture sunlight effectively, taking inspiration from the natural chlorophyll in plants, and crafted copper electrocatalysts resembling tiny flowers to mimic enzymes regulating photosynthesis.

Remarkably, this work culminated in crafting an artificial leaf architecture about the size of a postage stamp, capable of converting CO2 into C2 molecules using only solar energy. This represents a significant step towards scalability and efficiency improvements, with the potential to integrate into larger systems capable of powering industries or providing sustainable fuel alternatives for vehicles, including those that cannot yet run on batteries.

Supported by the DOE Office of Science, this groundbreaking research aligns with Berkeley Lab’s commitment to advancing energy innovation and addressing global energy challenges.

   - High energy and infrastructure costs for CO₂ scrubbing are deemed prohibitive without major breakthroughs or subsidies.  

3. **Comparisons to Existing Solutions**:  
   - Solar panels and biofuels (e.g., corn ethanol) are contrasted with the new tech. While photosynthesis is ~1% efficient, photovoltaics (PV) are much more efficient, raising debates over land use trade-offs (e.g., “100 acres of solar panels vs. 99 acres of wilderness”).  
   - Some argue PV-powered systems (e.g., electric vehicles) already offer better land-use efficiency than biofuels.  

4. **Environmental Impact Debates**:  
   - Discussions on whether replacing biofuels with synthetic fuels would reduce pressure on agricultural land or inadvertently encourage deforestation for industrial-scale "artificial photosynthesis farms."  
   - Critiques of industrial farming (e.g., fertilizer dependence, biodiversity loss) underscore the need for sustainable alternatives.  

5. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Questions about the device’s energy efficiency and whether it can outperform existing electrochemical CO₂ conversion methods.  
   - The role of perovskite stability and catalyst design in real-world applications is noted but remains unproven.  

6. **Alternative Approaches**:  
   - Some suggest focusing on distributed CO₂ scrubbing (e.g., integrating catalysts into HVAC systems) for incremental impact.  
   - Others humorously propose sci-fi solutions like space-based radiators or giant atmospheric pumps.  

**Conclusion**: While the technology is hailed as a promising step toward sustainable energy, significant hurdles—scale, cost, and competition with existing solutions—cast doubt on its near-term viability. The discussion reflects broader tensions between techno-optimism and pragmatic concerns about real-world deployment.

In a world abuzz with talks of AI replacing programmers, a recent experiment offers a fresh perspective: think of AI as a "mech suit" for developers rather than a replacement. The experience of using Claude Code, a language model-powered coding tool, to develop two substantial applications sheds light on this relationship. The analogy of Ripley’s Power Loader from "Aliens" is particularly apt; these tools amplify human capabilities while keeping creativity and control firmly in human hands.

Using Claude Code, a traditionally months-long backend project was expedited to mere weeks, with the tool handling massive amounts of code generation. However, vigilance was crucial, as AI could make baffling decisions without human oversight—such as altering frameworks incorrectly or inserting unnecessary dependencies.

This dynamic demands a shift in the programming mindset. Coding time, previously dominated by writing and debugging, has shifted towards understanding business needs and conceptualizing solutions. With code generation almost instantaneous, developers must hone their skills in guiding AI output, scrapping inefficient code without hesitation—a practice that contradicts the typical reluctance to discard already written code.

In essence, while AI can dramatically accelerate certain aspects of development, it requires developers to maintain a strategic oversight, constantly engaging and steering the AI. The article concludes that while AI has simplified some tasks, the foundational skills and experience of skilled developers are more crucial than ever, highlighting that the future of programming lies in collaboration between human insight and machine efficiency.

The Hacker News discussion on using AI as a "mech suit" for developers reflects diverse perspectives on how tools like Claude and LLMs are reshaping coding workflows. Key themes include:

1. **Shift in Developer Roles**:  
   With AI handling code generation, developers focus less on writing/debugging and more on **problem understanding**, **high-level design**, and **business logic**. The ability to rapidly discard and regenerate code with AI contrasts with traditional attachment to manually crafted code.

2. **AI’s Strengths and Limitations**:  
   - **Efficiency**: AI excels at syntax recall, boilerplate code, and speeding up repetitive tasks (e.g., renaming variables, framework setup).  
   - **Weaknesses**: Struggles with **abstract problem-solving** (e.g., data structure design) and often generates overly complex or vulnerable code. Participants noted instances of AI injecting unnecessary dependencies or flawed logic.  
   - **Code Quality Concerns**: Vigilant review is essential, as AI tools can produce insecure or nonsensical code, especially in unfamiliar domains.

3. **Enterprise Challenges**:  
   In large teams, AI’s role is debated. While conventions and rigid frameworks (e.g., Angular) benefit from AI-assisted consistency, enterprise environments with varying skill levels and legacy systems risk amplifying poor practices. Some argue disciplined processes (testing, code reviews) are more critical than raw code generation.

4. **Learning and Skill Development**:  
   - **Pros**: AI aids newcomers by generating working code and simplifying initial learning curves.  
   - **Cons**: Over-reliance risks superficial understanding; foundational skills like problem decomposition and debugging remain irreplaceable.  

5. **Workflow Evolution**:  
   Developers describe using AI in **iterative cycles** (e.g., TDD with AI-generated drafts, refining prompts, and validating outputs). Tools like Gemini or Cursor help manage large codebases but require deep familiarity with the language to guide meaningful changes.

**Final Takeaway**:  
AI amplifies productivity but doesn’t replace strategic thinking. Success hinges on pairing AI’s speed with **human oversight**, **domain expertise**, and **critical evaluation**—highlighting that developers remain essential architects, even as AI becomes a powerful collaborator.

In a rapidly evolving AI landscape, our understanding and measurement of AI's intelligence, creativity, or empathy remain murky, as highlighted by Ethan Mollick in his exploration of AGI—or Artificial General Intelligence. Traditional benchmarks like the Turing Test, initially designed as theoretical challenges, now serve as questionable indicators of AI capabilities in an era where such tasks are increasingly surmountable by machines.

Mollick notes that AGI’s definition is fraught with controversy, tangled in debates about the scope and nature of tasks required for AI to achieve human-level performance. Enter the latest advancements in AI models, such as OpenAI’s "o3" and Google's "Gemini 2.5 Pro," which significantly push benchmark boundaries and showcase remarkable agentic abilities, allowing them to perform complex tasks autonomously.

A notable experiment saw "o3" executing a series of challenging instructions—from crafting marketing slogans to building a mock-up website—all in under two minutes. This demonstrates its potential as a "Reasoner," showcasing evolved capabilities reminiscent of AGI, yet these breakthroughs beg the question of what exactly constitutes true artificial general intelligence.

Mollick’s term "Jagged Frontier" captures the unsettling and unpredictable nature of AI's progress—it’s impressively advanced yet remains inconsistent across different applications. He suggests that to truly grasp AGI’s potential, one must personally engage with these models, possibly “feeling the AGI” through tailored interactions.

This ongoing experiment with AI-generated discussions, research, and applications underscores the technology's enormous potential—and its equally vast uncertainties—highlighting the vital need for adaptable benchmarks in gauging AI’s evolution.

Enthusiastic tech historians and retro computing fans will be delighted by the latest adventure in resurrecting forgotten computing eras! A bold retrocomputing developer has tackled the challenging task of equipping the DEC Professional 380, a notoriously incompatible member of the PDP-11 family, with its own bespoke TCP/IP stack. This ambitious project is inspired by the nostalgia of days when the Commodore 64 and similar systems ruled the geek world—days when building compatibility often required ingenuity and a good deal of stubbornness.

With the help of AI and decades of collective networking wisdom, the developer has crafted a barely adequate, pre-C89 TCP/IP stack using Slirp-CK to allow the Pro 380, running a System V Unix variant called PRO/VENIX V2.0, to engage with the modern web—even as far as downloading the Google homepage in all its glory over a SLIP connection. This venture not only revives the bygone era when Digital Equipment Corporation was experimenting with desktop PDP-11s, it also bestows new life into an architecture that was initially tailored to avoid cannibalizing DEC’s own product lines, only to become a distinct oddity amid the computer revolution in the early '80s.

What’s remarkable is the project's back-to-future nature, drawing from the intricate web of Unix iterations and fractured digital history. Developers of that time, such as the VenturCom crew led by Myron Zimmerman, were among the pioneering Unix licensees, eager to capitalize on the nascent Unix market.

What's particularly engaging about this endeavor is not just the technical hurdle it overcomes, but its invitation to learn from history—recalling how DEC's vision of a unified desktop-and-minicomputer line diverged into a spontaneously incompatible reality. In fact, their ambition to rival IBM’s PC success inadvertently fueled a resurgence in niche computer archaeology. This juxtaposition of past and present computing challenges is not merely an exercise in nostalgia but a testament to the enduring spirit of innovation where old machines—and their modern allies—find new ways to converse in our connected world.

### To Make Language Models Work Better, Researchers Sidestep Language

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-language-models-work-better-researchers-sidestep-language-20250414/) | 24 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744809)

In Anil Ananthaswamy's recent article for Quanta Magazine, researchers are exploring new ways to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by sidestepping their reliance on language. Traditionally, LLMs, like those using transformers, process information by translating mathematical representations into words. This requirement to verbalize concepts can slow down processing and lead to potential information loss.

The core of an LLM's function occurs in a mathematical realm known as "latent space," where complex number sequences are manipulated to understand and generate text. However, translating these numerical computations into words demands extra computational resources and can act as a bottleneck, limiting the model's efficiency.

Two recent studies, highlighted by Mike Knoop and Luke Zettlemoyer, point towards innovative LLM architectures that allow models to maintain thought processes within latent space more extensively before producing text. This method has shown potential for both increased efficiency and improved reasoning capabilities.

In essence, these advancements seek to minimize the frequent conversions between latent computations and language expressions, a process that often involves creating a "chain of thought" or a token sequence mimicking thought processes. By allowing more reasoning to remain within the mathematical domain, researchers like Shibo Hao at the University of California, San Diego, are paving the way for a new era of AI—one less constrained by verbalization hurdles, potentially transforming the landscape of natural language processing.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the inefficiency of traditional LLMs compared to human reasoning and explores technical alternatives to mitigate these issues. Key points include:

1. **Human vs. LLM Reasoning**:  
   Humans solve problems through relatively simple, iterative reasoning steps, while LLMs require billions of parameters to mimic even basic reasoning. This highlights a gap in efficiency and elegance between biological and artificial intelligence.

2. **Chain of Thought Limitations**:  
   The "chain of thought" approach, which converts internal reasoning into tokenized outputs, risks information loss due to frequent translations between latent computations and language. This bottleneck underscores the need for alternative architectures.

3. **Latent Space Retention with Recurrent Networks**:  
   Recurrent networks are proposed as a way to keep reasoning within the mathematical "latent space" longer, reducing reliance on token generation. This aligns with research aiming to enhance LLMs by minimizing lossy conversions to text.

4. **Flow Matching & Iterative Processes**:  
   The discussion highlights "flow matching," an iterative method likened to solving differential equations step-by-step. Instead of generating tokens at each step, models update latent vectors incrementally (e.g., predicting 𝑥₀, an initial state, directly). This approach mirrors how recurrent networks process sequences and could streamline reasoning by avoiding intermediate verbalizations.

5. **Transformers in Latent Space**:  
   Techniques like integrating Gaussian noise into transformers’ latent space processing are mentioned. This allows models to predict outcomes (e.g., 𝑥₀) directly within the latent domain, bypassing repetitive token generation and improving computational efficiency.

**Takeaway**: The conversation emphasizes the potential of recurrent architectures and latent-space-focused methods (like flow matching) to enhance LLM efficiency and reasoning by reducing dependency on text-based intermediate steps, drawing parallels to both mathematical problem-solving and human cognition.
