#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08566) | 106 points | by [ksec](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ksec) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42028873)

In a noteworthy advancement for handling large datasets, a research paper titled "SPANN: Highly-efficient Billion-scale Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search" presents a cutting-edge memory-disk hybrid indexing and search system. Developed by Qi Chen and a team of eight researchers, SPANN aims to address the challenges faced by traditional approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) algorithms, particularly their inefficiency in managing massive databases.

SPANN adopts an innovative approach by utilizing an inverted index methodology, where centroid points of data are kept in memory, while the bulkier posting lists reside on disk. This structure not only enhances disk-access efficiency by minimizing the number of required accesses but also maintains high search recall rates by retrieving quality posting lists.

Key features include a hierarchical balanced clustering algorithm that optimizes posting list lengths and a dynamic query-aware mechanism that prunes unnecessary accesses during searches. Remarkably, SPANN outperforms the current leader, DiskANN, achieving recall rates of 90% for both the first and tenth nearest neighbors in just around a millisecond, all while utilizing only 32GB of memory. As the demand for efficient data retrieval grows, this research, accepted at NeurIPS 2021, demonstrates a significant leap in the scalability of data searches for AI and database applications. 

For those looking to delve deeper, the paper is accessible online, and the relevant code is available for further exploration.

### Gemini API and Google AI Studio Now Offer Grounding with Google Search

#### [Submission URL](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/gemini-api-and-ai-studio-now-offer-grounding-with-google-search/) | 24 points | by [illnewsthat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=illnewsthat) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42008834)

Google has unveiled an exciting new feature for developers using the Gemini API and Google AI Studio: Grounding with Google Search. This functionality significantly enhances AI responses by integrating real-time data from Google Search, improving accuracy and reducing the likelihood of "hallucinations" in AI outputs. By enabling this feature, developers can ensure their applications deliver fresh, factual information alongside reliable sourcing, fostering greater trustworthiness.

Developers can easily activate Grounding through the Google AI Studio or the API for a fee of $35 per 1,000 grounded queries, with free testing available in the studio. The new feature provides not only improved responses but also links to relevant sources, making AI applications more transparent and engaging for users.

In a practical demonstration using AI Studio's Compare Mode, the benefits of Grounding are clear: the system generates a richer, more informative response when grounded in recent search results, compared to outdated information without grounding. This capability allows applications to draw from up-to-date search results, making them more relevant across diverse use cases.

Google encourages developers to experiment with the dynamic retrieval settings, which tailor the grounding experience based on the predicted relevance of user queries. As excitement builds around this feature, Google looks forward to seeing innovative applications of Grounding with Google Search in the AI space.

The discussion surrounding Google's new Grounding feature highlights a mix of excitement and skepticism. One user, "ywnxyz," speculated about the potential integration of ChatGPT with search capabilities, indicating a broader interest in enhancing AI with real-time data. Another user, "Havoc," discussed the implementation of grounding in large language models (LLMs), suggesting that Google is making significant strides in this area. There’s some critique as well, with "ntnmykrnl" invoking Google's name in a potentially negative context, implying concerns about the company's approach or the implications of their technology. Overall, the dialogues reflect a community engaged in contemplating the future of AI development and its dependence on reliable data sources.

### Get Me Out of Data Hell
