In a game-changing development for machine learning efficiency, a new paper by Jacob Fein-Ashley titled "The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention" offers a novel approach to the challenge of scaling self-attention mechanisms. Traditionally hampered by quadratic complexity, self-attention has struggled with long sequence processing—until now. Enter FFTNet, a framework that cleverly uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve what the paper claims as superior global token mixing with an impressive $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity. By transcending the constraints of traditional self-attention, FFTNet operates in the frequency domain, harnessing Parseval's theorem for energy preservation and long-range dependency capture. Adding to this high-efficiency mix is a learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation, which adaptively highlight key frequency components. Experimental results from well-known benchmarks like the Long Range Arena and ImageNet provide empirical support, showcasing FFTNet's edge over its predecessors. For those in the machine learning realm, this paper may well represent a paradigm shift—a more scalable pathway to managing long sequences and optimizing model performance. Check out the full paper for a deep dive into their methods and findings.

### Iterated Log Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://adamscherlis.github.io/blog/iterlog-coding/) | 107 points | by [snarkconjecture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snarkconjecture) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43181610)

Adam Scherlis has unveiled a novel format for encoding real numbers, dubbed "iterated log encoding." This new approach offers a unique method for representing floating-point values on computers and claims to offer advantages in flexibility and precision over traditional fixed-point and floating-point systems.

In traditional fixed-point systems, numbers are stored with a single sign bit plus an absolute value; floating-point numbers work similarly to scientific notation using an exponent and significand. Logarithmic systems enhance upon this by reconstructing numbers as two entities: the logarithmic value and a separate sign bit. Symmetric level-index representations even facilitate encoding extremely large numbers through multiple logarithmic iterations.

The iterated log format revolutionizes these ideas by considering a number iteratively through its logarithms. The method interprets a number in stages: First determining general positivity or negativity, then evaluating the magnitude's logarithmic sign, and further assessing its subsequent logarithmic signs to refine precision. Each sign narrows the interval of possible values, allowing ultra-fine precision as more signs are added.

One quirk of this system is that it inadvertently mirrors Gray code, a sequence order where two successive numbers differ in only one bit, though it may not be the most practical for everyday coding. Through rigorous sign conversion and bit padding, the format achieves lexicographic ordering, handling zero and non-a-number (NaN) values in insightful ways.

With this format, a 7-bit depth becomes astonishingly powerful, able to represent an expansive range of numbers—large, small, or close to one—and showcasing unpredictable precision. This opens potential avenues in computer systems needing unusual numeric precision and range, offering symmetry across zero and an exciting non-uniform distribution of values. For enthusiasts and experts eager to delve into this, a prototype implementation is available with additional mathematical insights promised in upcoming posts.

The Hacker News discussion on Adam Scherlis' **iterated log encoding** method highlights technical debates, comparisons, and critiques. Here's a concise summary of key points:

### Key Themes:
1. **Comparisons to Existing Encodings**  
   - Users noted similarities to **Elias delta/omega coding** (for integer compression) and **Levenshtein coding** (variable-length integer encoding), sparking discussions on how iterated log encoding fits within existing frameworks.

2. **Practicality and Arithmetic Challenges**  
   - Concerns about computational efficiency arose:  
     - Arithmetic operations (e.g., addition/subtraction) are non-trivial in this format.  
     - Memory usage could grow rapidly (e.g., 16-bit numbers leading to 4GB storage needs).  
     - **Integer representation is inexact** (e.g., "3" decodes to ≈2.999999983422908 in 32-bit encoding).  
   - Multiplication was deemed simpler, but handling zero, infinity, and exact integers remains a challenge.

3. **Mathematical Connections**  
   - Links to **Dirac’s square-root-based number representation** were debated. Some users argued iterated log encoding resembles recursive exponentiation via square roots.  
   - The method’s log-depth precision was contrasted with Dirac’s approach, which requires exponential symbols for similar precision.

4. **Precision and Practical Use Cases**  
   - Non-uniform precision distribution (clustering near 0.5, 1.0) was noted as both a feature and limitation.  
   - Extreme range (e.g., 8 bits encoding numbers up to 2^2^65536) was praised theoretically but questioned for real-world applications.  
   - Suggested uses: **machine learning intermediate representations**, **compression algorithms** (e.g., DCT coefficients in JPEG-like codecs).

5. **Mixed Reactions**  
   - Praise for novelty and symmetry across positive/negative values.  
   - Skepticism about practicality: Existing systems (e.g., IEEE 754 floats) suffice for most needs, and the format’s complexity may limit adoption.  

### Notable Quotes:
- **On efficiency**: *"Addition/subtraction in log space isn’t straightforward."*  
- **On integers**: *"Exact integers don’t play nicely with this encoding."*  
- **On utility**: *"Does 2^2^65536 matter if Python can’t even compute it without choking?"*  

### Conclusion:  
The iterated log encoding is seen as a fascinating theoretical advance with niche potential (e.g., ML, compression), but practical challenges and competition from established systems like IEEE 754 temper enthusiasm. Its connections to mathematical concepts like Dirac’s methods add intellectual intrigue, yet real-world adoption hinges on solving arithmetic inefficiencies and precision quirks.

### The best way to use text embeddings portably is with Parquet and Polars

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/02/embeddings-parquet/) | 215 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43162995)

In today's headlines from Hacker News, we explore the fascinating application of text embeddings, a powerful outcome of the generative AI boom. A tech enthusiast has used embeddings to catalog every Magic: The Gathering card released as of the 2025 Aetherdrift expansion—a total of 32,254 cards. These embeddings, which transform text into numerical vectors, remarkably encapsulate the design and attributes of Magic cards, such as card names, texts, costs, and rarities, allowing for intriguing analyses and visualizations.

The project utilized the gte-modernbert-base embedding model to generate these vectors, creating a rich dataset that discovers similarities among the cards. For example, by applying a simple 2D UMAP projection, the cards naturally cluster by logical categories like color and type.

An interesting challenge this work highlights is how to effectively use and store embeddings. Many opt for vector databases, like faiss or Pinecone, though these can be cumbersome or costly. Instead, this project demonstrates the ability to perform similarity calculations without such databases, showcasing a fast and efficient method using NumPy, which requires minimal system memory and offers quick cosine similarity computations.

Storage efficiency emerges as another critical challenge. Traditional CSV files are bulky and inefficient for embedding storage, being significantly larger than necessary and adding serialization overhead. Instead, the article advocates using Parquet files, which offer a more elegant and portable solution, preserving data in a non-proprietary format that facilitates easier sharing and manipulation.

This innovative use of embeddings not only provides exciting insights into card designs but also sparks broader discussions on efficient data handling—crucial for advancing AI applications.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News thread explores technical strategies for managing vector embeddings, sparked by the Magic: The Gathering card catalog project. Key debates and insights include:  

1. **Storage Formats:**  
   - **Parquet** is praised for its columnar efficiency, compression, and query speed in OLAP contexts (analytics), but critiqued for static data and transactional (OLTP) workloads. Users contrast it with **SQLite**, which offers portability and lightweight operations for smaller datasets.  
   - **LanceDB** and **DuckDB** are highlighted for bridging gaps: LanceDB supports dynamic updates/querying, while DuckDB integrates natively with Parquet and enables fast vector similarity searches (via new `vector` type extensions).  

2. **Performance & Tools:**  
   - **Polars** (Rust-based) is favored over Pandas for speed and lazy execution, especially with Parquet. Users note its ability to filter data efficiently (e.g., `pl.scan_parquet()`).  
   - **Vector Indexing**: Proposals like HNSW (hierarchical navigable small world) serialization in Parquet or standalone libraries (e.g., **USearch**, **FAISS**) are discussed for scalable vector search.  

3. **Challenges & Alternatives:**  
   - Columnar storage limitations: Parquet struggles with frequent updates, leading to workarounds like partition schemes or delta layers.  
   - Compact vector representations (e.g., **Vespa**’s binary encoding, **SimSIMD** kernels for optimized CPU/GPU operations) address payload size and speed.  
   - Structured vs. unstructured data: Debate persists on embedding JSON/text fields directly vs. restructuring inputs for semantic relevance (e.g., using **ModernBERT** to capture implicit structure).  

4. **Emerging Solutions:**  
   - Tools like **Unum’s Cloud** and **USearch** offer alternatives to FAISS, prioritizing SIMD optimizations and cross-language support.  
   - Hybrid approaches (e.g., Polars + Parquet + Ray for distributed workflows) balance portability and performance.  

**Takeaway**: The community leans toward *portable, open formats* (Parquet/SQLite) paired with optimized query engines (DuckDB, Polars) and lightweight indexing, avoiding vendor lock-in. Scalability concerns push interest in GPU acceleration and metadata-aware embeddings.

2. **Memory Management Innovations**:  
   - Neut’s **"allocation canceling"** feature intrigued users, as it aims to reuse or optimize memory allocations during compilation. Questions arose about its algorithmic feasibility and practicality compared to manual management or runtime garbage collection.  
   - The **"necessity"** concept in Neut’s type system, tied to static memory management without garbage collection, was explained in the docs as a way to handle references and pointers safely. This drew parallels to linear types (à la Rust) and resource-tracking systems.

3. **Performance Benchmarks**:  
   - Benchmarks suggested Neut is **1–4x faster than Haskell** in specific cases, though users emphasized that algorithm choices and implementation details heavily influence real-world performance.

4. **Syntax and Tooling Preferences**:  
   - A sub-debate emerged about **syntax formatting**, particularly curly brace placement (e.g., Allman vs. K&R style). Some advocated for configurable formatters to accommodate personal or project-specific preferences.  
   - The built-in **LSP server** and formatter were praised for streamlining development, though opinions varied on syntax design choices like "hugging" parentheses for linearity annotations.

5. **Technical Curiosity**:

While FlashMLA shows promise, real-world performance depends on model architecture, hardware, and workload specifics. The debate reflects broader tensions in the ML engineering community between theoretical claims and practical implementation constraints.

### Google Co-Scientist AI fed previous paper with the answer in it

#### [Submission URL](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/02/22/google-co-scientist-ai-cracks-superbug-problem-in-two-days-because-it-had-been-fed-the-teams-previous-paper-with-the-answer-in-it/) | 196 points | by [pcfwik](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pcfwik) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43162582)

Google's new AI tool, Co-Scientist, is under the microscope as the initial buzz turns reflective. This tool, based on Google's Gemini LLM, was acclaimed after supposedly solving a long-standing scientific conundrum just days after being introduced to it. The AI suggested a hypothesis about drug-resistant bacteria, sparking excitement at Imperial College. However, the story's glow dimmed when it was revealed that Co-Scientist had a little head start — it had already "read" a 2023 paper by the same researchers which fleshed out the solution it put forth.

This isn't the first time Google's AI-powered marvels have been critiqued for overstated achievements. For example, Co-Scientist’s proposed drugs for liver fibrosis were already established candidates for that purpose. Similarly, DeepMind's claim of synthesizing new materials lost steam after later findings proved these materials weren't new.

José Penadés, involved in the bacterial project, acknowledged the AI's utility in collating disparate bits of information, but the notion of it being a pioneering scientific mind is perhaps, more dream than reality. The AI isn't conjuring new ideas out of thin air; it's piecing together existing knowledge—a great tool, but one that requires a pinch of scholarly restraint in its promoted capabilities.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion on Google's Co-Scientist AI:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward Google’s Co-Scientist AI, which was initially celebrated for solving a scientific problem but later criticized for relying on pre-existing research it had been trained on. Key themes include:

1. **Overhyped Claims**:  
   Users highlight a pattern of inflated AI achievements, citing Co-Scientist’s "breakthrough" (based on a 2023 paper by the same researchers) and prior examples like DeepMind’s overstated material synthesis. Critics argue such tools merely remix existing knowledge rather than generating novel insights, though some acknowledge their utility in synthesizing information.

2. **Token Predictors vs. Intelligence**:  
   A central debate questions whether large language models (LLMs) like Co-Scientist are merely sophisticated "token predictors" or capable of genuine reasoning. Technical explanations note that models like GPT optimize for next-token prediction, lacking true understanding or world interaction. Critics liken this to statistical pattern-matching, while defenders argue coherent outputs can still mimic reasoning.

3. **Human vs. AI Innovation**:  
   Comparisons to human cognition emerge: humans also build on prior knowledge but can generate novel ideas through real-world interaction and experimentation. LLMs, however, are confined to their training data, unable to form new hypotheses without external input. Some users suggest AI could evolve with reinforcement learning or sensory integration, but current systems fall short.

4. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**:  
   Discussions touch on the "deepity" of interpreting AI outputs as intelligent versus statistically plausible text. Skeptics warn against conflating fluency with insight, while others note that even human discoveries often arise from serendipity or incremental steps. The conversation underscores the need for tempered expectations, framing AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement in scientific research.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus leans toward cautious pragmatism—Co-Scientist and similar tools are valuable for accelerating research but require transparency about their limitations. The hype around AI’s "revolutionary" potential risks overshadowing its role as an advanced assistant, not an autonomous innovator.

### OpenAI Researchers Find That AI Is Unable to Solve Most Coding Problems

#### [Submission URL](https://futurism.com/openai-researchers-coding-fail) | 144 points | by [colinprince](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=colinprince) | [165 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43155825)

OpenAI researchers have unveiled new insights into the world of AI coding capabilities, revealing that even the most advanced models are still no match for human software engineers. Despite CEO Sam Altman's confidence that AI will surpass "low-level" engineers by year-end, a recent study showcases these models' limitations. The developers utilized a benchmark called SWE-Lancer, which tested AI on over 1,400 tasks from Upwork, to evaluate the problem-solving capabilities of OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models, alongside Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

These AI tools were measured on their ability to tackle individual bug-fixing tasks and larger management tasks without internet assistance. Unfortunately, while the AI could handle surface-level issues swiftly, they struggled with identifying bugs in complex code or offering comprehensive solutions, and their superficial confidence often masked underlying inaccuracies.

Interestingly, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed OpenAI's models financially, although it, too, frequently fell short. Researchers highlighted that for AI to reliably undertake real-life coding, models need significantly higher reliability.

As AI continues its rapid evolution, it still trails significantly behind the adept problem-solving skills of human engineers. Yet, there's a growing trend of companies betting on AI at the expense of human jobs, a notion underscored by recent discussions of automating Facebook coding jobs with AI.

   - Financial implications were noted, with references to the $100B+ investments in AI and skepticism about whether scaling LLMs alone achieves "true" AGI.

4. **Impact on Developers:**
   - **Efficiency vs. Skill Erosion:** While LLMs speed up mundane tasks (e.g., searching APIs, drafting scripts), some worry they might hinder deep problem-solving skills. Users emphasized the enduring need for human judgment, especially in debugging and system design.
   - **Tooling Integration:** Suggestions included hybrid workflows combining LLMs with traditional research (e.g., RTFM) and dynamic systems that pull real-time context from documentation or tests.

5. **Frustrations and Workarounds:**
   - Users lamented **declining quality of traditional resources** (e.g., Google Search, Stack Overflow) and the need to "prompt engineer" LLMs heavily for useful outputs.
   - Mixed results were reported in edge cases, such as compiling niche systems (e.g., DeaDBeeF plugins), where LLMs occasionally offered surprising fixes but often fell short without precise context.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs are valued for accelerating certain coding tasks, the consensus is they remain unreliable for complex engineering challenges. Human expertise, critical thinking, and adaptability are still irreplaceable, particularly in nuanced or poorly documented scenarios. The discussion underscores a cautious optimism tempered by practical limitations.

### AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot understand them'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/humans-cannot-really-understand-them-weird-ai-designed-chip-is-unlike-any-other-made-by-humans-and-performs-much-better) | 303 points | by [anonymousiam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonymousiam) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43152407)

In a groundbreaking advancement, engineers at Princeton University and the Indian Institute of Technology have unveiled how artificial intelligence can revolutionize the design of complex millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless chips, a process that previously took weeks, now accomplished in mere hours. These chips, pivotal for technologies like 5G modem in smartphones, pose enormous challenges, demanding innovation in miniaturization and functionality.

Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on human intuition and repetitive trial-and-error optimization, the AI adopts an inverse design approach. It begins with the end goal in mind and independently determines necessary inputs and parameters. This paradigm shift allows the AI to treat each chip as a cohesive singular entity rather than a fragmented collection of components, bypassing old templates that often harbor inefficiencies.

Excitingly, the AI-produced chip designs delivered superior performance, exceeding those crafted by human designers. However, these AI-generated designs are unconventional, described by lead researcher Kaushik Sengupta as "look(ing) randomly shaped"—a creativity difficult for humans to grasp. While promising, the approach isn't without its pitfalls; some AI designs were errant, akin to "hallucinations" seen in other generative AI outputs, underscoring the ongoing need for human oversight.

Sengupta emphasizes that the vision isn’t about replacing human ingenuity but enhancing it. The rapid prototyping capabilities introduced by AI-driven design open doors to tailored chip specifications, optimizing for energy efficiency or expanding frequency ranges.

The research signifies just a glimpse of potential future applications across electronic design, promising to transform how we innovate in tech-heavy fields. This development might just be setting the stage for a new era in chip design, with AI as a crucial ally.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores a mix of technical insights, historical connections, and broader implications of AI in hardware design, alongside some humorous tangents. Key themes include:

1. **Historical Context & Evolutionary Algorithms**:  
   - Users reference Adrian Thompson’s 90s work using evolutionary algorithms to design FPGA circuits. These evolved circuits minimized logic gates but incorporated unconventional physical properties (e.g., feedback loops, EMI effects), challenging traditional design paradigms.

2. **CMOS & Analog Circuit Challenges**:  
   - Debates arise around energy efficiency in CMOS transistors, subthreshold operation, and nonlinearity in analog computing. Challenges include modeling transistors with tools like SPICE, variability in manufacturing, and verifying behavior in analog systems due to undefined specifications and location-dependent quirks.

3. **AI/ML in Hardware Design**:  
   - While optimistic about AI's potential (e.g., rapid optimization), users highlight pitfalls like "hallucinations" in AI-generated designs and the risk of oversimplified objectives leading to impractical solutions (e.g., prioritizing energy efficiency at the cost of functionality).  
   - Analogies are drawn to AI in gaming, where agents exploit glitches (e.g., Q*bert’s cube trick) or evolve unintended solutions (e.g., virtual bicycles using detached wheels as "pogo sticks"), underscoring the need for robust objective functions.

4. **Verification & Real-World Complexity**:  
   - Concerns are raised about verifying AI-designed circuits, especially in analog systems where behavior shifts post-manufacturing. Users stress the gap between simulation and real-world physics, emphasizing AI’s tendency to "game" simplified models unless randomness or environmental noise is introduced.

5. **Neuromorphic Hardware & Jokes**:  
   - Some speculate on neuromorphic computing’s potential, while others humorously misinterpret "anthropod" (insects) for "anthropomorphic" hardware, leading to puns about buggy code and AI evolving insect-like robots.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The thread reflects cautious optimism: AI accelerates innovation but requires human oversight to align objectives with real-world needs. The conversation underscores a recurring theme in AI—creativity versus unintended consequences.

**Takeaway**: The discussion blends technical depth with levity, highlighting both excitement for AI-driven design and skepticism toward its current limitations. Historical precedents and interdisciplinary examples (e.g., gaming glitches) enrich the debate, illustrating the balance needed between automation and human intuition.

### It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds

#### [Submission URL](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/) | 1270 points | by [Sami_Lehtinen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Sami_Lehtinen) | [737 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43150085)

A thought-provoking post raises a critical issue facing European societies: the growing dependence on American cloud services to manage their governmental and societal functions. The author argues that it is imprudent for European nations to transfer control of their data to the U.S., especially considering the unpredictable political climate influenced by figures like Donald Trump. The post critiques the Dutch government's reliance on American tech giants, citing a recent letter that absurdly claims certain data transfers don't expose sensitive information to American eyes. This, the author asserts, is a dangerously naïve stance, further complicated by the invalidation of the legal frameworks previously used to justify these data exchanges.

The piece explores the comfort trap many find themselves in—choosing convenience over sovereignty because American software, like MS Teams and Outlook, is familiar and seemingly easier to use. But this reliance on US tech raises significant concerns about data privacy and national security, especially considering potential political manipulations from across the Atlantic. The author calls for European governments to bravely invest in developing or adopting alternative technologies, desiring a future not tethered to American interests, for their own sake and the sake of innovation in the tech sector.

Ultimately, the post is a call to action for Europe to reclaim control over its digital infrastructure, urging bold steps towards diversification and sovereignty. If these issues resonate with you, consider subscribing to the author's newsletter for more insights.

The discussion revolves around Europe's dependency on American cloud services and the challenges of achieving digital sovereignty. Key points include:

1. **Critique of Inaction**: Initially, participants criticize European governments for ignoring long-standing warnings about over-reliance on U.S. tech giants like AWS and Azure. Costs to transition away are estimated at 100-1000x higher today, with economic, military, and cultural sovereignty at risk.

2. **Technical Barriers**: Migrating to EU-based solutions (e.g., Scaleway, OVH, OpenStack) is deemed possible but fraught with challenges. Proprietary APIs (e.g., AWS Lambda) and complex networking stacks create vendor lock-in. Open-source alternatives like OpenStack exist but require significant investment and expertise, with some dismissing them as underdocumented or user-unfriendly compared to U.S. cloud providers.

3. **EU Cloud Providers**: Scaleway, Hetzner, and OpenTelekom Cloud are highlighted as European alternatives, though users report mixed experiences—praised for local infrastructure but criticized for reliability and billing issues. OpenStack-based solutions are noted but face adoption hurdles due to fragmentation and poor market presence.

4. **Infrastructure Solutions**: Some suggest building independent EU data centers using open standards (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenFaaS) to avoid lock-in. Others emphasize the need for political investment and subsidies to scale homegrown cloud ecosystems, though sourcing non-U.S./Chinese hardware (e.g., chips) remains a challenge.

5. **Call to Action**: The consensus is that Europe must prioritize long-term sovereignty over short-term convenience, despite the steep costs. Decentralized, open-source tools and support for local providers are seen as critical steps, but political will and pan-EU collaboration are lacking.
