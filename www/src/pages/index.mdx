### What techies keep getting wrong about industrial automation

#### [Submission URL](https://hivekit.io/blog/what-techies-get-wrong-about-industrial-automation/) | 36 points | by [wolframhempel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wolframhempel) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39817049)

The dream of fully autonomous automation in industrial settings has not materialized as quickly as envisioned decades ago due to various challenges faced by technologists. While the vision of smart mines and digital oil fields seemed promising, the reality is that operations have not drastically changed despite significant investment in technology and innovation initiatives. One key obstacle is the human-centered design of industrial sites, which limits the potential efficiency gains of automation. For example, the preference for giant haul trucks in mining operations, driven by labor costs, overlooks the potential benefits of smaller, self-driving trucks that could be more efficient and cost-effective. Embracing a machine-centric approach would require a fundamental shift in design thinking.

Moreover, partially automating industrial processes can create more complexity and inflexibility, negating the intended efficiency gains. Full automation of the production process is often necessary to realize the benefits of automation, despite the associated costs and interruptions. Market forces also play a significant role in hindering widespread automation. Mining equipment is expensive and specialized, leading to a high level of consolidation among manufacturers. These manufacturers often employ closed ecosystems and proprietary standards, locking buyers into their technology stack and limiting competition and innovation.

In conclusion, overcoming these obstacles and misconceptions about industrial automation will require a holistic approach that addresses design limitations, complexity of automation, and market dynamics. Only by rethinking traditional human-centered designs, embracing full automation, and fostering more openness and collaboration in the industry can the true potential of autonomous automation be realized.
