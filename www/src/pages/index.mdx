Artificial intelligence (AI) has had a significant impact on the tiny Caribbean island of Anguilla, thanks to its unique domain name extension, .ai. In the late 1980s, Anguilla was assigned the .ai domain, which has now become in high demand for AI companies. In an interview with IEEE Spectrum, Vince Cate, who manages domain registrations for the Anguillan government, discussed how the AI boom has affected .ai. Cate explained that he became the manager of the .ai domain after reaching out to Jon Postel, who was in charge of top-level domains. Since then, the surge in AI interest has led to a significant increase in .ai domain registrations. Cate mentioned that after the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, their sales went up by almost four times in the subsequent five months. This boom in registrations has proven to be a windfall for Anguilla, contributing significantly to the government's budget. Unlike other countries that have opened up their top-level domains to foreign companies for extended periods, Anguilla has kept control of its domain locally, ensuring that the government receives most of the revenue generated from .ai registrations.
