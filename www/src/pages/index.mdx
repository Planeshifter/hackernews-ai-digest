### Large Language Models for Compiler Optimization

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07062) | 202 points | by [og_kalu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=og_kalu) | [100 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37549216)

A recent paper on arXiv titled "Large Language Models for Compiler Optimization" explores the use of large language models for code optimization. The authors present a 7B-parameter transformer model trained to optimize LLVM assembly for code size. The model takes unoptimized assembly as input and outputs a list of compiler options to best optimize the program. During training, the model predicts instruction counts before and after optimization, as well as the optimized code itself, which significantly improves its performance. The model outperforms two state-of-the-art baselines that require thousands of compilations, achieving a 3.0% improvement in reducing instruction counts over the compiler. Additionally, the model demonstrates strong code reasoning abilities, generating compilable code 91% of the time and perfectly emulating the output of the compiler 70% of the time. This work showcases the potential of large language models in compiler optimization.

The discussion revolves around various aspects of the paper on large language models (LLMs) for compiler optimization. One comment notes that the paper does not discuss the importance of generated code semantics and suggests trying the approach on larger benchmarks. Another commenter highlights the misconception that LLMs directly model instructions, explaining that they instead generate passes for the compiler optimization. Another thread focuses on the challenges of achieving correctness in LLMs and the difficulty of measuring correctness. There is also a discussion about the potential of LLMs in addressing compilation optimization problems, but some express skepticism and suggest alternative approaches. The importance of both correctness and performance in compiler optimization is emphasized, as well as the need for further research in this area.

Researchers Tyler Angert, Miroslav Ivan Suzara, Jenny Han, Christopher Lawrence Pondoc, and Hariharan Subramonyam have introduced an exciting new creative-coding environment called Spellburst. The interface is built on a large language model (LLM) and aims to enhance the process of exploratory creative coding. In the field of digital artwork, artists often start with a high-level semantic concept, like a "stained glass filter," and then programmatically implement it by tweaking code parameters such as shape, color, lines, and opacity. However, translating these semantic constructs into program syntax can be challenging, and existing programming tools do not lend themselves well to rapid creative exploration.

Spellburst addresses these challenges by providing a node-based interface that allows artists to create generative art and explore variations through branching and merging operations. The platform also incorporates expressive prompt-based interactions, enabling artists to engage in semantic programming. Moreover, Spellburst offers dynamic prompt-driven interfaces and direct code editing, allowing users to seamlessly switch between semantic and syntactic exploration.

The researchers evaluated Spellburst with artists and found that it has the potential to enhance creative coding practices. This innovative tool not only facilitates the translation of artistic ideas into code but also bridges the gap between semantic and syntactic spaces. The findings from this study could inform the design of future computational creativity tools.

Spellburst's novel approach to creative coding has the potential to revolutionize the way artists bring their ideas to life through code. With its user-friendly interface and powerful features, Spellburst opens up new possibilities for exploratory creative coding.
