In a new study dissecting the 2023–2024 Danish labor market, economists from the University of Chicago and the University of Copenhagen reveal that despite the rapid adoption of generative AI models like ChatGPT in numerous workplaces, these tools have not yet significantly affected wages or employment. Published in the working paper "Large Language Models, Small Labor Market Effects," researchers Anders Humlum and Emilie Vestergaard examined the impact of AI chatbots across 11 automation-prone occupations such as accountants and software developers. Their extensive analysis of data from 25,000 workers across 7,000 workplaces found no substantial changes in earnings or work hours due to chatbot technology.

Interestingly, while AI chatbots have quickly become commonplace—with 64 to 90 percent of workers in the relevant sectors adopting them—actual productivity benefits appear limited. Workers reported an average time saving of just 2.8 percent, roughly an hour per week. Surprisingly, for some employees, AI tools even created new tasks, neutralizing potential efficiencies. The study also highlighted that merely 3 to 7 percent of any productivity gains enhanced worker earnings.

The researchers acknowledge that this study captures only the early phase of AI deployment and may not reflect future implications as integration deepens. While these findings cast doubt on immediate, sweeping labor market changes due to AI, they open the floor for further discourse and studies on the long-term economic impact of generative AI as the technology and its applications evolve.

Simultaneously, Benj Edwards from Ars Technica highlights this study's importance, pointing out how it both tempers current narratives of AI-driven job market transformation and sets the stage for continued research into this rapidly advancing sector. Keep an eye on future developments as they unfold in the world of AI.

The discussion around the study on AI's impact on Denmark's labor market reveals a mix of skepticism, real-world anecdotes, and debates about AI's limitations and future potential. Key themes include:

1. **Skepticism of Overhyped Claims**: Users compare the study to past automation fears (e.g., junior roles in law), noting that AI tools, while adopted widely, often fall short of transformative promises. Examples include customer service chatbots struggling with complex issues (e.g., Klarna’s initial AI shift and subsequent rehiring of humans) and inflated corporate narratives about efficiency gains.

2. **AI’s Practical Limitations**: Participants shared frustrations with AI in customer service (e.g., broken airline booking systems, utility providers) where bots failed to resolve issues, necessitating human intervention. While AI handles routine tasks (40% of requests in some cases), users highlight its inability to manage nuanced problems, leading to workflow friction.

3. **Shifting Job Dynamics**: Some argue AI redistributes work rather than eliminating jobs—freeing humans for harder tasks but also increasing job complexity. Zuckerberg’s claim that AI allows call centers to tackle tougher issues was critiqued, with users noting systemic bloat and managerial challenges in large corporations (e.g., Meta’s headcount debates).

4. **Corporate Realities vs. Promises**: Critiques of corporate governance emerged, questioning whether AI adoption is driven by genuine efficiency or cost-cutting amid mismanagement. Comments highlighted how companies may overstate AI’s benefits while underinvesting in user experience or employee support.

5. **Long-Term Uncertainty**: While the study found minimal current labor market impact, users debated whether this is a "frontier" phase, with future AI advancements potentially disrupting jobs more profoundly. Others stressed caution, emphasizing AI’s incremental role rather than revolutionary change.

In sum, the discussion aligns with the study’s conclusions: AI adoption is real but nuanced, with limited immediate effects on wages or employment. Skepticism persists about current capabilities, and the consensus leans toward AI as a tool that reshapes work rather than replaces it outright—for now.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/agi-is-not-a-milestone) | 34 points | by [steebo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=steebo) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43856762)

In a thought-provoking essay by Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan, the notion of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a milestone in AI's development is challenged. They argue that AGI, often seen as an imminent breakthrough, doesn't represent a clear-cut event with immediate, transformative impacts akin to the creation and deployment of nuclear weapons during the Manhattan Project. Rather than marking a sudden leap in technology, AGI might evolve through incremental advancements and human-like capabilities, like those demonstrated in OpenAI’s latest model o3.

The essay downplays the idea of AGI as a distinct tipping point that would surpass human control. The authors emphasize that AGI's significance lies not in reaching a specific capability threshold but in how AI systems integrate and diffuse across industries over time, requiring complementary innovations at a human pace. This perspective challenges fears of catastrophic risks associated with AGI, suggesting that power shouldn't be conflated with potential capabilities.

Kapoor and Narayanan further argue that the proliferation of AGI definitions is problematic, reflecting more about AGI's speculative impacts than its present reality. Evaluating whether an AI like o3 constitutes AGI, they propose, can only be meaningfully assessed in hindsight, not at a system’s launch. They criticize pervasive analogies of AGI to nuclear weapons, stating that such comparisons often result in misleading predictions and counterproductive policy recommendations.

Ultimately, even though some experts view models like o3 as exhibits of emerging AGI capabilities, the authors contend that these advancements—even if revolutionary in scope—are not clear indicators of having reached AGI. Instead, such developments should be seen as part of a continuing journey in AI's evolution, requiring caution, thoughtful design, and incremental growth rather than alarmist reactions or hasty declarations of breakthroughs.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) as a concrete milestone, sparked by an essay challenging its framing as a transformative breakthrough. Key points from the comments include:

1. **AGI as a Vague Concept**: Users debate whether AGI is a meaningful term or a marketing buzzword. Some argue its definitions are overly broad and speculative, allowing companies to exploit it for hype (e.g., OpenAI’s "o3" model reigniting debates despite unclear benchmarks).

2. **LLMs: Capabilities vs. Understanding**: While LLMs like ChatGPT are praised for linguistic prowess, critics emphasize they lack true understanding, functioning as "language calculators" without separable reasoning. Their success is attributed to pattern recognition, not cognitive depth.

3. **Industry Hype vs. Reality**: Commentators note the disconnect between AI’s commercial adoption (e.g., rapid ChatGPT uptake) and its limitations. The industry’s profit-driven promotion of AGI risks overshadowing incremental progress and practical applications in areas like energy systems or manufacturing.

4. **Physical and Cognitive Limitations**: Current AI’s inability to master physical tasks (e.g., robotics, plumbing) or match animal cognition (e.g., frogs) underscores the gap between specialized tools and hypothetical AGI. Even advanced models struggle with tasks requiring embodied intelligence.

5. **Incremental Progress Over Milestones**: Many reject the idea of AGI as a sudden leap, advocating instead for focusing on gradual advancements. The essay’s argument—that AGI’s impact hinges on integration into society, not a singular breakthrough—resonates, with users highlighting the slow, complementary innovations needed for meaningful change.

6. **Misleading Analogies**: Comparisons of AGI to nuclear weapons or industrial revolutions are criticized as hyperbolic. ChatGPT’s popularity, while significant, is seen as a tool rather than a paradigm shift, with overstated claims distracting from pragmatic safety and policy considerations.

In summary, the discussion reflects skepticism toward AGI as a defined milestone, emphasizing the need for nuanced evaluation of AI’s evolving role, grounded in real-world applications rather than speculative hype.

### A new sign that AI is competing with college grads?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/economy/archive/2025/04/job-market-youth/682641/) | 72 points | by [Bluestein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bluestein) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43858495)

The job market for young, educated workers is experiencing a concerning turn, with unemployment rates for recent college graduates at an unusually high 5.8%, according to the New York Federal Reserve. This worrying scenario is echoed in struggles faced by even those holding newly minted M.B.A.s from elite programs. Law-school applications are on the rise, reminiscent of behaviors during the great financial crisis when graduate school became a refuge for young people.

Three potential explanations are being considered to unpack this shift. Firstly, the labor market for young people hasn’t fully bounced back from the long-standing effects of the coronavirus pandemic, and may even be carrying scars from the Great Recession. After hitting a peak in 2009, recovery was slow, only to be further disrupted by pandemic setbacks and ensuing economic measures to control inflation, particularly impacting tech and white-collar industries.

The second theory suggests a structural shift in the value of college degrees. Research indicates that since 2010, the lifetime-earnings gap between college and high-school grads has stabilized, while the demand for college degrees in job postings is dropping. This reflects an uncertain return on investment for higher education, contrasting with a positive trend for non-college-educated workers whose economic prospects have improved slightly since then.

Lastly, the role of artificial intelligence in transforming employment is also considered. Economists speculate that AI could potentially substitute traditional entry-level tasks performed by young graduates, indicating a more profound transformation in job dynamics. Today's graduates are stepping into an economy where their skills are not as in demand, pointing towards broader technological changes or economic caution among employers over hiring.

Despite alarming indicators such as the all-time low recent-grad gap—where young college graduates usually outshine the overall workforce for unemployment rates—the evidence for AI-induced job displacement remains ambiguous. Economic experts like LinkedIn’s chief economist, Karin Kimbrough, suggest the current job market is more reflective of employers’ cautious short-term hiring strategies rather than a digital displacement.

The unfolding labor landscape for young grads signals anything from short-term economic challenges to monumental shifts in the educational and technological fabric of employment. As Derek Thompson of The Atlantic writes, this is an important trend to monitor closely.

The Hacker News discussion explores the challenges young, educated workers face in the job market, focusing on AI's role, structural economic shifts, and debates about education. Key points:  

1. **AI’s Dual Role in Skill Development and Job Displacement**:  
   - Many commenters argue that AI tools (like LLMs) help automate entry-level coding tasks (e.g., writing sorting algorithms or debugging), saving time and boosting productivity. However, reliance on AI risks creating a "crutch" effect, where new graduates skip understanding fundamentals, akin to using calculators without learning math.  
   - Some worry AI could replace junior roles entirely, with employers opting for AI-supervised code reviews over human hires. Others counter that AI is merely a pragmatic tool, emphasizing that real-world work often prioritizes results over theoretical purity.  

2. **Structural Shifts in Education and the Job Market**:  
   - Concerns about college degrees losing value persist, as job postings increasingly de-emphasize formal education. Some suggest the pandemic, offshoring, and economic policies (e.g., ZIRP, Section 174 tax changes) have compounded job scarcity in tech and white-collar sectors.  
   - Schools are criticized for not adapting curricula to balance foundational knowledge with AI integration. A recurring analogy compares today’s AI reliance to past debates over calculators: while tools evolve, understanding core concepts remains critical.  

3. **Offshoring and Economic Factors**:  
   - Offshoring development and outsourcing to cheaper labor markets (e.g., LATAM, Asia) are cited as major factors squeezing entry-level roles. Companies cutting internal teams (e.g., QA) exacerbate the problem, while older workers delaying retirement limit openings for new grads.  

4. **Debates on Learning and Pragmatism**:  
   - A heated thread debates whether using AI “robs” learners of agency. One side argues it stifles deep understanding (e.g., treating systems as "black boxes"), while the other views it as a practical way to meet deadlines, acknowledging that professionals often rely on existing tools without full mastery.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects tension between embracing AI’s efficiency and fearing its erosion of foundational skills, alongside broader economic and structural challenges. The job market struggles of young graduates appear driven by a mix of technological disruption, corporate cost-cutting, and evolving educational relevance.
