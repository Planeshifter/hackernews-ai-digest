### Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02258) | 262 points | by [milliondreams](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=milliondreams) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39960717)

The latest submission on arXiv discusses a cutting-edge approach to transformer-based language models in a paper titled "Mixture-of-Depths: Dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models". The authors, including David Raposo and five others, propose a method where transformers can learn to allocate compute dynamically to specific positions in a sequence rather than spreading FLOPs uniformly. By capping the number of tokens that participate in computations at each layer and using a top-k routing mechanism, the models can optimize compute allocation along the sequence for different layers. This dynamic approach allows for efficient compute expenditure while maintaining baseline performance, making the models faster and more effective.

The discussion on the latest submission about dynamically allocating compute in transformer-based language models covered various aspects such as the comparison between Recursive Neural Networks (RNNs) and Recursive NNs, the distinction between specific models, the challenges with training models, the analogy of network processing to human brain functions, the attention mechanism, the improvements in dynamic routing mechanisms, the understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs), the implications of recurrent structures, the potential of Universal Transformers, and the application of modern techniques to enhance model efficiency. Furthermore, it delved into the complexity of model design, the significance of token context windows, and the evolution of transformer architectures. Participants highlighted the need for clear explanations and provided resources for further exploration of related concepts.

### CISA publishes 447 page draft of cyber incident reporting rule

#### [Submission URL](https://therecord.media/cisa-publishes-circia-rule-cyber-incident-reporting) | 62 points | by [anigbrowl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anigbrowl) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39954149)

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has released a 447-page draft of a new rule requiring critical infrastructure organizations to report cyber incidents promptly to the federal government. This rule, known as the Cyber Incident Reporting for Critical Infrastructure Act (CIRCIA), aims to enhance the government's ability to respond to incidents and improve cybersecurity across various sectors. The rule mandates reporting cyber incidents within 72 hours and ransomware payments within 24 hours for certain critical infrastructure organizations.

CISA will designate 16 critical infrastructure sectors, including manufacturing, energy, financial services, healthcare, transportation, and water utilities, to comply with the new reporting requirements. Despite concerns about the potential burden and cost of implementing the rule, CISA officials believe that the information received will help enhance cybersecurity measures and provide valuable insights to the cybersecurity community.

Some cybersecurity experts have expressed mixed feelings about the initial draft, questioning the limited scope of organizations covered by the rule. Concerns have been raised about excluding smaller companies, such as hospitals and medical device firms, from the reporting requirements, potentially leading to incomplete data and increased risks. Suggestions have been made to streamline reporting obligations for smaller organizations while ensuring comprehensive incident reporting.

The public will have 60 days to comment on the rule before it is officially published on April 4, with CISA planning to make revisions over the next 18 months.

### Identifying Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 images from VAE artifacts (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://hforsten.com/identifying-stable-diffusion-xl-10-images-from-vae-artifacts.html) | 65 points | by [rcarmo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rcarmo) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39944452)

Henrik recently blogged about the latest developments in AI-generated images, focusing on the new SDXL-VAE 1.0 release. This updated version of the text-to-image generation model has stirred up some buzz due to visible artifacts in the generated images, particularly around the edges. These artifacts, caused by the VAE neural network responsible for encoding and decoding images, have sparked discussions on the need for clear identification of AI-generated content.

While some speculate that these artifacts could serve as a watermark for detecting AI-generated images, Stability AI, the creators of SDXL, have not officially confirmed this. The model includes an invisible watermark to mark images as AI-generated, but this can be easily removed from the program. The SDXL 1.0 VAE differs from the 0.9 version in its decoder weights, impacting the image quality around the edges.

Performance-wise, the 1.0 VAE exhibits a slightly lower peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) compared to the 0.9 VAE, as per Stability AI's report. These differences are noticeable, with the 1.0 VAE artifacts being distinct and identifiable upon closer inspection. Henrik even created a simple neural network to detect these artifacts, showcasing the impact of the VAE changes on image quality. Overall, these updates shed light on the evolving landscape of AI-generated content and the ongoing efforts to ensure responsible usage in this domain.

This new feature allows seamless interaction between different services without the need for complex setup, making it feel like using a regular library. The Workers RPC system boasts features like passing structured clonable types, functions, and objects with methods as parameters, with performance enhancements such as reduced latency and streamlined network calls. Security is a priority, based on the object-capability model, and the protocol is open-source and built on Cap'n Proto.

RPCs enable communication between programs over a network, resembling regular function calls rather than traditional request-response protocols like HTTP. Despite past criticisms, modern RPC systems with features like Promises and async/await are efficient and widely used in distributed systems. An example scenario provided demonstrates how Workers RPC simplifies communication between Workers, eliminating the need for manual HTTP request handling. This advancement facilitates streamlined interactions between different services, enhancing developer productivity and system performance.
