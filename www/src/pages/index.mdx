In a controversial move, a "spy" robot has been causing unrest among public servants in federal offices in Gatineau, Quebec. The robot, dubbed "the little robot" by employees, is part of the VirBrix platform and is equipped with over 20 sensors and a 360-degree camera. It collects data on various workplace conditions such as air quality, light levels, and even measures gases like CO2 and radon.

While the government insists that the robot is used to optimize workspaces and cannot identify individual employees, union representatives and employees feel that it invades their privacy and is unnecessary. The Government Services Union raised concerns about employees feeling constantly monitored and questioned the need for such surveillance when attendance and performance can already be monitored through existing methods.

As the federal government plans to transition employees back to the office, the robot's presence has stirred up concerns about control rather than creating a positive work environment. The union is also worried about the data being collected, especially after a previous incident involving sensors at workstations. Despite assurances from the government that the robot is only meant to improve workplace efficiency, employees remain skeptical about its intentions.

The government has defended the robot, stating that its purpose is to evaluate office space utilization and help in reducing the office footprint in the future. The minister of public services and procurement emphasized that the technology is anonymous and focuses on creating better work environments for employees. The creators of the robot also clarified that it does not retain identifying information about individuals and only collects data related to environmental health and safety.

### An 'Algorithm' Turned Apartment Pools Green

#### [Submission URL](https://prospect.org/infrastructure/housing/2024-06-18-how-algorithm-turned-apartment-pools-green/) | 43 points | by [alexzeitler](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alexzeitler) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40732789)

In a surprising turn of events in the real estate world, an Austin-based real estate influencer managed to sell off a group of apartment complexes for a hefty sum, leaving many scratching their heads as the deal seemed economically unsound. However, a credit rating agency saw potential in the properties due to renovations and a plan to increase rents significantly using a software called Yieldstar.

Yieldstar, originally designed to provide pricing recommendations based on market data, has been accused of being a tool for artificially inflating rent prices, leading to a surge in rental costs across various markets. This has resulted in skyrocketing rents in several cities, with tenants feeling the pinch of these exorbitant increases.

RealPage, the company behind Yieldstar, has been implicated in lawsuits alleging rent manipulation and retaliation against those who resist the program. The software not only facilitated rent hikes but also ingrained perpetual rent inflation into the financial projections of multifamily housing, contributing to a decline in underwriting standards and inflated property valuations.

As interest rates rose, landlords found themselves turning to Yieldstar to extract even more revenue from renters, regardless of the living conditions. The software's influence on the rental market has raised concerns about its impact on apartment living in America, highlighting a troubling trend of prioritizing profits over tenant well-being.

The ongoing debate around the role of companies like RealPage in shaping the rental market raises questions about the sustainability and fairness of current housing practices, underscoring the need for greater scrutiny and regulation in the real estate industry.

The European Commission is proposing a controversial measure called Chat Control 2.0, which would require providers to automatically scan all private chats, messages, and emails for suspicious content in an effort to combat child sexual exploitation material. This proposal has sparked concerns about mass surveillance and the end of privacy in digital correspondence. The proposal would mandate scanning for all email and messenger providers, even those with end-to-end encryption. While the EU Parliament has largely opposed this measure, the EU Council has not reached a consensus. As a result, there is a proposed extension of voluntary Chat Control 1.0 in the meantime. Critics argue that the proposal could lead to ineffective network blocking, personal cloud storage screening, mandatory age verification, and app store censorship. Proponents argue that it is necessary to combat child exploitation. The discussions around Chat Control 2.0 are ongoing, and the outcome remains uncertain.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the European Commission's proposal for Chat Control 2.0. Users express concerns about the potential infringement on privacy rights and the implications for democracy. Some argue that the proposal violates people's rights and could lead to arbitrary government labeling and censorship. Others point out the complexities of distinguishing between democratic and non-democratic policies and the misuse of such measures by certain political parties. There is also debate about the effectiveness of the proposed measure in combating child exploitation and the impact on democratic decision-making processes within the EU. Additionally, there are discussions about environmental regulations, voting systems, and the role of national governments in shaping EU policies.
