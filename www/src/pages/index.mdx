### Predicting OpenAI's ad strategy

#### [Submission URL](https://ossa-ma.github.io/blog/openads) | 561 points | by [calcifer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=calcifer) | [512 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46668021)

What’s new
- The post pushes back on “OpenAI is doomed” narratives and frames OpenAI’s next act as an ads business.
- OpenAI reportedly began rolling out ads on Jan 16, 2026 to Free and Go tiers: clearly labeled units at the bottom of answers, with controls to see “why this ad” or dismiss.
- Stated principles: ads won’t influence answers, conversations aren’t shared/sold, users can turn off personalization. Plus/Pro/Business/Enterprise remain ad‑free.

Rollout the author expects
- Q1 2026: limited beta with select advertisers.
- Q2–Q3: expansion into ChatGPT Search for free users.
- Q4: sidebar sponsored content + affiliate/checkout features.
- 2027: international expansion and a self‑serve ads platform.
- Possible “conversational ads” where you can ask follow‑ups about products.

By the numbers (author’s cites/estimates)
- 2025: $10B ARR by June; first $1B revenue month in July; aiming for $20B ARR; burn $8–12B.
- Usage: ~800M WAU, ~190M DAU, 35M paying subs, 1M business customers; approaching 1B WAU in 2026; ~2.5B prompts/day.
- Ads revenue targets reported elsewhere: $1B in 2026, scaling to $25B by 2029 (OpenAI hasn’t confirmed).

Positioning vs incumbents
- Google: high intent + full adtech stack → ~$296B ads run rate; implied ARPU ≈ $59/user/yr.
- Meta: low intent + full stack → ~$50 global ARPU.
- X: engagement + limited stack → ~$5.5 ARPU.
- ChatGPT: high intent, massive scale, but no vertical ad stack yet. The author places its ARPU potential closer to Search than Social—somewhere between X and Meta initially, with upside if it builds the stack (auction, targeting, commerce/affiliate, checkout).

Why it matters
- Assistants are converging with search: both Google (Gemini + AI Overviews ads) and OpenAI are racing to monetize “answer engines.”
- Trust will hinge on whether “answer independence” holds up, how clearly ads are labeled, and regulatory scrutiny.
- For marketers: a new, high‑intent channel; expect self‑serve auctions, affiliate hooks, and conversational product flows.
- For developers/publishers: more zero‑click answers and shifting discovery dynamics as assistant surfaces become ad inventory.

Author’s stance: OpenAI isn’t dying or angling for acquisition; it’s gearing toward a giant IPO and building the next big ad platform disguised as AGI.

**Discussion Summary**

While the original post focused on OpenAI's pivot to advertising, the comments veered into a broader debate on the macroeconomic friction of advertising costs and their relationship to wages.

*   **The Cost of Customer Acquisition:** The discussion sparked when a founder lamented that their robotic pharmacy startup spends $40M annually on advertising against only $5M on software and facilities. They argued that tech platforms (Google, Meta) function as rent-extractors, taking up to 50% margins and forcing businesses to act as pass-through entities for ad revenue.
*   **Ad Spend vs. Wages:** A commenter proposed that high advertising spend is a symptom of income inequality. The theory is that suppressed wages lower general purchasing power, forcing companies to spend aggressively to capture the remaining demand. They cited *The Spirit Level*, noting a correlation between high inequality and high ad spend in rich nations, attributed to status anxiety.
*   **The Henry Ford Debate:** Users debated the "Henry Ford" economic theory—that raising wages creates the customers needed to buy products. 
    *   **Skeptics** argued the math doesn't work for individual firms: if a car company doubles wages, those workers only spend a tiny fraction (e.g., 7%) of that new income on cars, resulting in a net loss for the firm.
    *   **Proponents** countered that this is a collective action problem. While it fails for a single "island economy" or firm, widespread wage increases boost aggregate demand because workers have a higher marginal propensity to consume than investors.
*   **Productivity vs. Distribution:** The thread devolved into a dispute over economic modeling. Some users argued that raising wages without increasing productivity (the "coconut island" model) merely causes inflation. Others pushed back, arguing that modern economies suffer from distribution issues and demand shortages rather than a lack of supply or productivity.

### Starting from scratch: Training a 30M Topological Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tuned.org.uk/posts/013_the_topological_transformer_training_tauformer) | 135 points | by [tuned](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tuned) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46666963)

Tauformer: a topological twist on Transformers, with early signs of promise at 30M params

- What’s new: Instead of dot‑product attention, Tauformer compresses each head to a single “taumode” scalar via a Graph Laplacian over a domain embedding (“domain memory”). Attention logits are then just the negative distance between these scalars. The aim: bias attention toward domain-relevant structure rather than generic geometric similarity.

- How it works:
  - Keep the usual Q/K/V, RoPE, causal masking, and softmax/value aggregation.
  - Replace Q·K scoring with a bounded Rayleigh-quotient energy xᵀLx/(xᵀx+ε) mapped to [0,1), yielding a per-token, per-head scalar λ.
  - Logits = −|λ_q − λ_k| / temperature.

- Why it could be cheaper:
  - KV-cache can store (V, λ_k) instead of (K, V), trimming per-layer cache by roughly ~50% for typical head dims.
  - With a sparse, precomputed Laplacian from a domain manifold, computing λ can depend on nnz(L) rather than dense D² operations.

- The 30M run (TauGPT, GPT‑2–style):
  - 6 layers, 6 heads, d_model=384, seq_len=1024, vocab=30,522.
  - AdamW, base LR 5e‑4, 100‑step warmup; routed validation (~5%).
  - Throughput ~60K tokens/s on ~7 GB VRAM; total tokens ~655M over 5,000 steps.
  - Validation loss drops from ~4.93 (step 100) to ~2.36 (step 2000), with a best ~1.91 at step 4500; later steps show volatility/regression.
  - Notably, taumode (the attention geometry) was fixed throughout this run.

- Takeaways:
  - Early learning is strong and fast at this small scale even without updating the domain geometry.
  - The later instability suggests the geometry may need to adapt as weights evolve.

- What’s next:
  - “Adaptive” taumode strategies that periodically recalibrate (including gradient‑gated schemes to detect energy drift).
  - Larger‑scale tests (~100M parameters).
  - Release of code, configs, data, and logs under a permissive license once consolidated.

- Why it matters:
  - If the Laplacian‑guided scalar attention holds up, it could bring domain-aware inductive bias, smaller KV caches, and potentially cheaper inference—especially compelling for long‑context or memory‑constrained deployments.

Bonus curiosity: The author flags an open question—how does cross‑entropy relate to the learned taumode distribution during training?

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Scaling and Viability**
Much of the discussion focused on whether a 30M parameter test is sufficient to predict success at scale. User `Lerc` and others cautioned that performance differences at 30M rarely represent behavior at 30B or 72B, urging the author to run "real-world" benchmarks before claiming victory. The author (`tnd`) acknowledged this, noting the current roadmap includes scaling to 100M, but emphasized that early benchmarks against a Karpathy nanoGPT fork showed comparable generation quality with ~20% faster inference.

**Architecture and Efficiency**
The reduction of the KV-cache size (by roughly 50%) was identified by users like `fby` as a "massive win" if the model quality holds up. When asked if this could be swapped into existing models, the author clarified that the architecture requires a total redesign—shifting from vector interactions to scalar interactions in a topological space—meaning current model weights cannot simply be converted.

**Technical Constraints and Comparisons**
Discussion arose regarding the efficiency of the fixed Laplacian matrix. While some feared the pre-computation might be heavy, the author argued that calculating sparse Laplacian vectors is negligible ("infinitely cheaper") compared to the dense dot-product operations required by standard attention. Other commenters drew parallels to older graph-based language modeling research, such as Sparse Non-Negative Matrix models, and discussed how this approach differs from how standard Transformers handle locality via position vectors.

**Tokenization Tangent**
A side conversation explored replacing discrete tokens with embeddings or byte-level encodings to better capture code syntax (e.g., for IDEs). The author noted that the Tauformer's manifold Laplacian approach might be particularly well-suited for such structure-heavy domains like code snippets.

### Show HN: Figma-use – CLI to control Figma for AI agents

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/dannote/figma-use) | 109 points | by [dannote](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dannote) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46665169)

Figma, meet the command line: figma-use brings full read/write control (not just read) to Figma via a CLI and JSX renderer, aimed at humans and AI agents alike.

Why it’s interesting
- LLM-friendly interface: use compact CLI commands or describe UIs in JSX (echo '<Frame…>' | figma-use render). The author argues this is cheaper and more natural for agents than verbose MCP/JSON-RPC schemas.
- Goes beyond Figma’s official MCP plugin, which is read-only; this supports creating/editing nodes, styles, variables, components, exports, and more.

How it works
- Install via npm, add the companion Figma plugin, and run a local proxy. Then:
  - Imperative mode: figma-use create frame --width 400 --fill "#FFF" ...
  - Declarative mode: pipe pure JSX over stdin; for logic/variants, use .figma.tsx files.

Notable features
- Components and real ComponentSets with variants; define once, instantiate many.
- Iconify integration: drop in 150k+ icons by name (e.g., mdi:home, lucide:star).
- Figma Variables as design tokens with fallbacks in JSX; CLI supports var:Tokens or $Tokens.
- Diffs: structural patches with validation and visual diffs highlighting pixel changes.
- Exports and inspection: one-liners to export nodes/screenshots; readable page tree.
- 100+ commands; designed for chaining in agent workflows.

Caveats
- stdin render only accepts pure JSX (no variables/logic).
- Requires running the plugin/proxy with Figma desktop (Development mode).
- MCP/JSON-RPC are supported, but the author notes extra overhead vs CLI/JSX.

Details
- Open source (MIT). Repo: dannote/figma-use (≈220★). Package: @dannote/figma-use on npm.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The "Code-First" vs. "Design-First" Workflow**
The most active debate centers on how AI tools like Cursor and Claude are changing the design-to-engineering loop.
*   One user shared their experience prototyping with Cursor, noting it saved them 10 hours a month and allowed them to build rapidly using natural language. However, this resulted in a monolithic "10k line index.html" file, creating a new problem: high technical debt and a difficult handoff process.
*   The community debated whether "figma-use" could solve this by syncing that code *back* into Figma to create a structured design system.
*   Some argued that syncing back is necessary to maintain a "source of truth," while others cautioned against letting LLMs write directly to component libraries, citing governance issues and "design drift." A proposed ideal stack involved `Figma Variables -> Token Studio -> Storybook -> MCP` to maintain order.

**CLI vs. MCP (Model Context Protocol)**
Users discussed the efficiency of the tool’s CLI approach compared to the emerging MCP standard.
*   **Token Efficiency:** Several commenters, including the author, noted that CLIs are more "token-efficient" for agents than MCP. MCP relies on verbose JSON-RPC schemas, whereas CLIs use concise text commands, which saves on context window usage and cost.
*   **Session Management:** Counter-arguments highlighted that MCP provides consistent session management, whereas CLI tools might struggle with state or security (e.g., handling secrets/passwords via environment variables vs. clear text).

**Feature Requests & Capabilities**
*   **CSS/Tailwind Integration:** Users asked if they could apply styles from an existing codebase (e.g., Tailwind classes) directly to Figma. The author (`dnnt`) explained that while the tool currently binds colors to Figma variables, parsing CSS/Tailwind configs automatically is a planned future feature.
*   **Vector Manipulation:** In response to a challenge to "make a pelican riding a bicycle" (a litmus test for vector complexity), the author pushed an update enabling vector path manipulation (commands like `path set`, `move`, `scale`, `flip`) and provided example commands to modify path data.
*   **Licensing:** There was a brief discussion on whether this bypasses Figma's licensing models. The author clarified the tool relies on the Plugin API, which interacts with the free component of Figma's ecosystem.

**Other Comparisons**
*   **PenPot:** Users asked about support for PenPot (an open-source Figma rival). The discussion briefly touched on it being "developer-friendly" but shifted back to Figma’s dominance.
*   **ASCII Art:** One user shared a similar projects that generates ASCII wireframes to allow for "zero friction" UI critiques.

### How scientists are using Claude to accelerate research and discovery

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/accelerating-scientific-research) | 119 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46664540)

Anthropic case study: Claude is moving from “chatbot” to lab coworker

- What’s new: Anthropic highlights how researchers are using Claude for end-to-end scientific work, not just literature review or coding. Since launching “Claude for Life Sciences,” the Opus 4.5 model reportedly improved at figure interpretation, computational biology, and protein benchmarks. An AI for Science program offers free API credits to high-impact projects.

- The big idea: Agentic AI that orchestrates many domain tools to plan experiments, clean/merge messy data, run analyses, and interpret results—compressing workflows that take months into hours while keeping experts in the loop.

- Standout example — Stanford’s Biomni:
  - A Claude-powered agent that routes plain‑English requests across hundreds of bio tools, packages, and databases spanning 25+ subfields.
  - GWAS pipeline ran in ~20 minutes versus months, handling cleaning, confounders, missingness, hit interpretation, and pathway context.
  - Validation case studies:
    - Designed a molecular cloning experiment whose blinded evaluation matched a postdoc with 5+ years’ experience.
    - Processed 450+ wearable data files (CGM, temp, activity) from 30 people in 35 minutes vs an estimated 3 weeks for a human expert.
    - Analyzed 336k single cells from human embryonic tissue, confirming known regulatory relationships and surfacing new candidate transcription factors.
  - Safety/quality: Guardrails detect when the agent drifts; labs can “teach” domain SOPs as skills. In rare-disease diagnosis work, encoding a clinician’s step‑by‑step method notably improved outcomes.

- Why it matters: If reliable, agentic AI that natively navigates the fragmented bioinformatics ecosystem could remove major bottlenecks (data wrangling, tool selection, protocol design) and enable new research strategies.

- Caveats and open questions:
  - External benchmarking and reproducibility beyond handpicked case studies.
  - Error modes, oversight burden, and how often guardrails trigger.
  - Data governance/privacy for sensitive biomedical data.
  - Cost, vendor lock‑in, and maintenance across fast‑evolving tools and databases.

- Also noted: The post teases additional, more specialized systems (e.g., automating interpretation of large-scale CRISPR knockout screens), but details weren’t included in the excerpt.

Bottom line: Labs are starting to package expert SOPs and a zoo of bio tools behind agentic interfaces powered by Claude. Early results suggest big productivity gains; the next hurdle is rigorous validation and trustworthy deployment at scale.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**Reliability and Confidence Intervals**
A significant portion of the discussion focused on whether LLMs can genuinely provide "confidence levels" for their scientific findings. Skeptics argued that LLMs are fundamentally text generators that often "hallucinate" numbers, citing anecdotes of models failing basic tasks like reading street numbers accurately. Conversely, technical commenters argued that models can be calibrated to treat token probabilities as confidence values, comparing the architecture to how CNNs handle classification confidence in computer vision.

**Computational Prediction vs. "Wet Lab" Reality**
Users debated the practical utility of Claude in the biological sciences. While conceding that LLMs excel at finding patterns in massive datasets (such as genomics), critics cautioned that biology is notoriously difficult to model ("really damn hard"). One commenter noted that computational predictions for things like molecular binding often fail when tested physically (the "wet lab" phase), leading to skepticism about claims of massive productivity leaps without rigorous experimental validation.

**The Human Element**
The conversation touched on the comparison between AI and human error. When critics pointed out AI "hallucinations," others countered that human scientists are also prone to errors, bias, and producing low-quality research ("slop"). The consensus leaned toward viewing LLMs not as truth machines, but as tools to narrow down infinite search spaces and generate hypotheses that humans must then verify.

**Technical Nuances**
Smaller side discussions explored the mechanics of how Vision Transformers process images compared to LLMs, and the potential barriers (such as reproducibility and copyright) preventing models like Gemini from ingesting entire scientific corpora for synthesis.

### Tired of AI, people are committing to the analog lifestyle in 2026

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/18/business/crafting-soars-ai-analog-wellness) | 83 points | by [andy99](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andy99) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46671020)

- What’s happening: CNN Business reports a growing movement to “go analog” as homes fill with AI assistants and algorithmic feeds. It’s less a detox, more a long-term shift toward tangible, offline tasks and entertainment to reclaim attention, creativity, and privacy.

- By the numbers: Craft retailer Michaels says searches for “analog hobbies” are up 136% in six months; guided craft kit sales rose 86% in 2025 and are expected to grow another 30–40% this year; searches for yarn kits surged 1,200% in 2025. The chain is expanding shelf space for knitting.

- Why people are doing it: Fatigue with repetitive, low-effort “AI slop” and doomscrolling; desire to “cut the internet off from the information about me,” as UC Riverside’s Avriel Epps puts it. Mental health and post-pandemic coping are strong drivers.

- What it looks like: Landlines and “dumb phone” modes, tech-free craft and wine nights, screen-free Sundays, swapping Spotify for an old iPod, shooting film, even buying a physical alarm clock. It isn’t anti-tech—just selective tech.

- The catch: Going fully offline is hard. Even analog advocates rely on the internet to run small businesses or communities. The article’s author tried 48 hours “like it’s the ’90s” and found parts of the exercise inherently performative in a digital-media world.

Why it matters for HN: This signals demand for offline-first, privacy-preserving tools and simpler devices that decouple function from feeds. Expect more products and communities built around intentionality, low/no connectivity, and human-paced creation—plus a cultural counterweight to AI-generated content.

**The “Analog Lifestyle” Backlash to AI**

***

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion on Hacker News validates the article's premise while offering deeper critiques on the nature of "offline" trends and digital fatigue.

*   **Digital Exhaustion & "Enshittification":** The overarching sentiment is that AI is merely the "final straw" in a long line of user-hostile tech trends, including subscription fatigue, data breaches, and intrusive ads. Commenters frequently cited Cory Doctorow’s concept of "enshittification" and used the term "slop" to describe the current state of internet content. Users see the analog shift as a rejection of an internet that has been hollowed out by algorithmic engagement farming.
*   **The Superiority of Paper for Learning:** A significant thread debated the cognitive differences between physical books and screens (Kindles/iPads). Arguments favored paper for its "spatial awareness" and lack of context-switching distractions. Anecdotes highlighted a pushback against ed-tech in schools (citing examples from Denmark), with parents noting that restricted, screen-based learning often hampers retention and critical thinking compared to traditional note-taking.
*   **The "Performative" Value of Analog Kits:** Skeptics analyzed the statistics regarding the surge in "craft kits" (specifically knitting). They argued this trend is actually driven by *online* algorithms (TikTok trends and influencers), creating a paradox where people buy mass-produced kits to perform an "offline lifestyle" for an online audience. Some argued true offline hobbies don't require pre-packaged, viral products.
*   **Friction vs. Addiction:** The conversation touched on the design philosophy of modern tech, which aims to remove all friction. Commenters noted that "friction" (or inherent limits) is often necessary for self-control. The rise of "dumb phones" was compared to addiction recovery, with users debating whether willpower alone is enough to combat devices literally designed to hijack dopamine loops.
*   **Semantics & Workarounds:** There was a side discussion regarding the definition of "analog" (technically continuous signals vs. colloquially "non-digital"). Additionally, complaints about the CNN website's UI led to users suggesting technical workarounds, such as using `lite.cnn.com` or archive links to read the text without "bloat."

**Top Comment:** "Is AI the final straw? Social media exhaustion, ending accounts, wars, subscription stupidity, smart devices/appliances... Chatbots are the latest in a long line of digital rent-seeking/privacy-invading scams."

### Counterfactual evaluation for recommendation systems

#### [Submission URL](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/counterfactual-evaluation/) | 79 points | by [kurinikku](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kurinikku) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46655524)

Counterfactual Evaluation for Recommendation Systems (8 min) — Eugene Yan argues that standard offline metrics for recommenders (precision/recall/NDCG on static logs) treat the task as observational, when it’s inherently interventional: recommendations change what users see and thus what they click or buy. He frames A/B tests as the clean causal answer but costly and risky, and shows how counterfactual evaluation with Inverse Propensity Scoring (IPS) can estimate how a new policy would perform without shipping it—by reweighting logged rewards by the ratio of new vs. old recommendation probabilities. Practical tip: get those probabilities from impression logs (often better than normalizing model scores) to correct for presentation bias; this need for propensities explains why many public datasets fall short—Open Bandit is a notable exception. He also flags pitfalls, starting with insufficient support when the new policy recommends items rarely or never exposed by the old one. Takeaway: treat recsys as causal, log propensities, use IPS to triage ideas offline, then confirm with A/B.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

The discussion focused on the practical implementation of counterfactual evaluation and the nuances of gathering high-quality data. Users validated the author’s premise, noting the common frustration where "perfect" offline metrics fail to generate lift in actual A/B tests.

Key technical points raised in the thread included:

*   **Handling Baselines:** For systems without an established history, participants suggested starting with simple baselines (like "most popular" or random sorting) to build the initial propensity logs required for these techniques.
*   **Data Quality & Depth:** A significant portion of the discussion centered on logging. Users argued that simple click data is insufficient; logs must include "non-clicks" (items scrolled past) and "depth" metrics (dwell time or add-to-cart actions) to distinguish genuine interest from accidental clicks or immediate bounce-backs.
*   **Safe Randomness:** While randomized control groups are essential for unbiased data, users warned that fully random recommendations ruin the user experience. A proposed solution was injecting random items into specific slots (e.g., position 5) rather than randomizing an entire session.
*   **Theoretical Frameworks:** One user questioned the underlying statistical framework, asking which specific type of counterfactual theory (e.g., Pearl’s, Classical, or Constructor theory) justifies the model's appropriateness.
*   **Method Comparisons:** The SNIPS normalization technique mentioned in the context of the article was compared to Mutual Information factor correction used in co-occurrence models.

### ClickHouse acquires Langfuse

#### [Submission URL](https://langfuse.com/blog/joining-clickhouse) | 209 points | by [tin7in](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tin7in) | [95 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656552)

Headline: ClickHouse acquires Langfuse; OSS, self-hosting, and roadmap unchanged

Why it matters:
- The analytics database behind many AI stacks just bought one of the leading open-source LLM observability/evaluation platforms. Expect tighter performance, scalability, and enterprise features for teams running AI in production.
- Signals continued consolidation in the LLM tooling layer as core infra vendors pull key app-layer components closer.

What stays the same for users:
- Open source and self-hosting remain first-class; no licensing changes planned.
- Langfuse Cloud continues with the same product, endpoints, and SLAs.
- Roadmap and support channels unchanged.

What likely gets better:
- Faster performance and reliability work by co-developing directly with the ClickHouse engineering team.
- Accelerated enterprise-grade security/compliance.
- More mature customer success/playbooks via ClickHouse’s GTM and support org.

Backstory:
- Langfuse started as tracing and eval primitives for LLM apps; early versions ran on Postgres.
- Scale demands (high-throughput ingest + fast analytical reads) led v3 to switch to ClickHouse.
- The two companies had already been collaborating: Langfuse Cloud is a large ClickHouse Cloud customer, ClickHouse teams use Langfuse, and they’ve co-hosted community events. Thousands of teams met ClickHouse through Langfuse’s v3 migration.

Why this deal, not a Series A:
- Langfuse says it had strong Series A options but chose ClickHouse to move faster while keeping its OSS/self-hosted identity and production-first focus. The whole team joins ClickHouse.

Caveats and open questions:
- Long-term independence of the OSS project and governance will be watched closely, though the team reiterates no licensing changes and commitment to self-hosting.
- With v3 already on ClickHouse, the de facto backend choice is clear; watch for how flexible self-hosted deployments remain.

What to watch next:
- Deeper ClickHouse Cloud integrations, benchmarks, and migration tooling.
- Roadmap on enterprise features (security, compliance), higher-throughput ingestion, and reliability at scale.
- Any pricing or packaging changes on Langfuse Cloud (none announced).

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**The Big Picture: ClickHouse’s Platform Strategy**
Users see this acquisition as part of a clearer pattern following ClickHouse's recent $400M raise. Combined with the previous acquisition of HyperDX (an observability platform), commenters suggest ClickHouse is aggressively aggregating tools to evolve from a niche analytics engine into a comprehensive alternative to data giants like Snowflake and Databricks.

**The "Time Series" vs. "AI" Debate**
A significant technical debate erupted regarding categorization. While ClickHouse is technically a columnar OLAP database, users discussed its rebranding as an engine for "AI agents" and "Time Series."
*   **Skepticism:** Some viewed the pivot to LLM tooling as "marketing fluff" to chase AI valuations, noting that database vendors often rebrand to match current hype cycles.
*   **Technical Defense:** Others argued the fit is natural; observability data (logs, traces, spans) *is* time-series data, an area where ClickHouse has already absorbed significant market share due to its ingestion speed. A sidebar discussion questioned whether LLMs themselves technically count as "time series models" (predicting the next token based on sequential history).

**The Economics of Open Source**
The discussion spurred a philosophical sidebar about the sustainability of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS).
*   **VC Dependence:** Commenters pointed out that while users love "independent" FOSS, modern open-source projects are heavily subsidized by Venture Capital. A specific example cited was the PostgreSQL ecosystem, where many core contributors are actually employed by VC-backed for-profit companies (like Snowflake, Neon, or Supabase).
*   **Legacy vs. Modern:** Users contrasted this with foundational FOSS (Linux, GNU, BSD), which historically had less reliance on the VC churn model, though others retorted that even Linux development involves corporate funding today.

### Show HN: I built a tool to assist AI agents to know when a PR is good to go

#### [Submission URL](https://dsifry.github.io/goodtogo/) | 38 points | by [dsifry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dsifry) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46656759)

Good To Go: a “done or not” gate for AI-driven pull requests

AI agents can write code and open PRs, but they’re bad at knowing when they’re actually merge-ready. Good To Go (gtg) tackles that missing piece with a single, deterministic check: gtg 123 returns a clear status—READY, ACTION_REQUIRED, UNRESOLVED, CI_FAILING, or ERROR—so agents (and humans) can stop polling, guessing, or nagging.

What it does
- Aggregates CI: Collapses all GitHub checks and commit statuses into pass/fail/pending, handling multiple systems and required vs optional checks.
- Classifies review feedback: Separates ACTIONABLE must-fix items from NON_ACTIONABLE noise and AMBIGUOUS suggestions. Includes parsers for CodeRabbit, Greptile, Claude Code, and Cursor to respect their severity/approval patterns.
- Tracks thread resolution: Distinguishes truly unresolved discussions from ones already addressed in later commits.

Agent-first design
- Structured JSON output with action_items the agent can execute.
- Sensible exit codes: default exits 0 for analyzable states so agents parse JSON; optional semantic exit codes for shell use.
- State persistence to remember dismissed or handled comments across sessions.

How teams can use it
- As a required CI gate: PRs don’t merge until they’re truly READY.
- Inside agent workflows: decide to merge, fix comments, resolve threads, or wait for CI without infinite loops.
- For PR shepherding: monitor status changes over time.

Quick start: pip install gtg, set GITHUB_TOKEN, run gtg 123 (auto-detects repo). Also supports explicit repos and human-readable output.

The discussion around **Good To Go (gtg)** focuses on the safety of AI autonomous merging, the necessity of the tool compared to native GitHub features, and the trade-offs between velocity and strict process enforcement.

**Safety and Human Oversight**
A primary concern raised by users like `rootnod3` and `glemion43` was the fear that this tool allows AI to bypass human review and "merge shit itself" directly to production.
*   **Clarification:** The creator (`dsfry`) and others (`dnnn`, `tayo42`) clarified that "Ready" does not mandate an auto-merge. Instead, it serves as a reliable signal that a PR is legally ready for human eyes (tests passed, blocking comments addressed).
*   `dsfry` described the workflow: agents act as "smart interns" that must clear the `gtg` deterministic gate before a senior/human reviews the code, preventing humans from wasting time on broken builds.
*   `ljm` and `bxtr` raised security scenarios, such as malicious bug reports via Jira/Linear prompting agents to introduce vulnerabilities. `dsfry` countered that the code still undergoes review and assessment layers.

**Utility vs. Native Tools**
Skeptics questioned why this abstraction is needed over existing solutions.
*   `nyc1983` asked why standard GitHub status checks and branch protections aren't sufficient, dismissing it as "AI slop."
*   **The Differentiator:** `dsfry` explained that native GitHub checks are binary (pass/fail) but don't parse nuance in comments. `gtg` distinguishes between **ACTIONABLE** feedback (must fix) and **AMBIGUOUS** suggestions or nitpicks. This prevents agents from looping infinitely on non-blocking comments or hallucinating that they are done when they aren't.
*   `jshrbkff` expressed a dislike for coupling workflows to specific platforms like GitHub or CodeRabbit.

**Implementation and Trade-offs**
*   **Velocity vs. Quality:** `jshnpl` noted decision trade-offs: the tool forces strict adherence to process, which improves code quality and reduces interruptions but might slow velocity as agents get "stuck" trying to satisfy the `gtg` green light. `dsfry` confirmed this was an intentional design choice to reduce human context-switching.
*   **Technical details:** `mclly` and `bltt` discussed using pre-push hooks or the Model Context Protocol (MCP) instead. The creator argued that hooks struggle with context (e.g., recognizing when a comment is marked "out of scope" and should be ignored), whereas `gtg` is designed to handle that state persistence.

**Meta-Commentary**
Several users (`phlpp-gyrt`, `fryfntrs`) criticized the submission text itself, suspecting it was written by an LLM due to its style ("lacks decency," "reductive nonsense"). `dsfry` defended the text, noting the difference between internal release notes and public documentation requires effort that LLMs can assist with.

### AI industry insiders launch site to poison the data that feeds them

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/11/industry_insiders_seek_to_poison/) | 15 points | by [Teever](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Teever) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46661731)

Top story: AI insiders launch “Poison Fountain” to sabotage model training

- What’s new: A small group of anonymous AI industry insiders has launched Poison Fountain, a site coordinating a mass data-poisoning effort aimed at degrading AI models that scrape the web for training data. The Register reports the project has been live about a week and is run by at least five people (not yet publicly verified; they promise PGP-signed proof).

- How it’s meant to work: Website operators are encouraged to link to pages hosting “poisoned” content so AI crawlers ingest it. The group frames this as an information war, saying they aim to “inflict damage on machine intelligence.” The hosted payloads reportedly include subtly incorrect code intended to mis-train models that learn from public repositories. (No operational details were shared in the piece.)

- Why now: The effort cites Anthropic research suggesting that even a small number of malicious documents can meaningfully degrade model quality. Backers argue regulation is too slow and the tech too widespread; they echo Geoffrey Hinton’s warnings about AI risk.

- Context and parallels: Similar in spirit to Nightshade (which booby-traps images against scraping), Poison Fountain targets text/code training pipelines. It lands amid concerns about “model collapse” from synthetic data feedback loops and a broader push by AI firms to secure cleaner, verified corpora (e.g., licensing Wikipedia-grade sources).

- Skepticism and risk: The organizers’ identities remain unverified; the space already has scammy “poisoning” schemes. There’s also overlap with misinformation campaigns: poisoning the commons harms not just model builders but downstream users.

- Why it matters: If this gains traction, expect an arms race in data provenance and filtering—more whitelists, licensed data deals, stricter crawl controls, and legal pushback—alongside intensified trust battles over what the web is “safe” to train on.

- What to watch: Proof-of-participation via PGP, any takedowns or legal action, technical countermeasures from model makers (poison detection, source whitelisting, robustness training), and whether mainstream sites quietly join—or publicly condemn—the effort.

**Discussion Summary:**

The conversation on this specific post was brief, focusing on technical feasibility and redirection to a larger thread:

*   **Attack Viability:** Users questioned the effectiveness of the proposed "poisoning" architecture. One commenter asked if relying on a single URL would simply lead to a Denial of Service (DoS) or make it easy for crawlers to ignore the source. A respondent clarified that the initiative appears to encourage users to replicate the poisoned pages across multiple locations to create a distributed attack vector rather than a centralized one.
*   **Previous Discussion:** It was noted that this submission is a duplicate, with the primary discussion located in an earlier thread.

- FLUX.2 [klein] 4B (distilled): Fully open under Apache 2.0; best for local/edge; supports T2I/I2I/multi-ref
- Base variants (undistilled 9B/4B): More diversity and full training signal for fine-tuning/LoRA/research; 4B Base under Apache 2.0, 9B Base under NCL

Quantized releases (with NVIDIA)
- FP8: up to 1.6× faster, ~40% less VRAM
- NVFP4: up to 2.7× faster, ~55% less VRAM
- Benchmarked on RTX 5080/5090 at 1024×1024; general speed measured on GB200 (bf16)

Licensing note
- “FLUX [dev] Non-Commercial License” renamed to “FLUX Non-Commercial License” (no material changes); applies to 9B Klein models
- 4B models are Apache 2.0; 9B weights are available under NCL

Why it matters
Real-time visual generation/editing that runs locally opens the door to interactive design tools, agentic visual reasoning loops, and rapid creative iteration without cloud latency or massive GPUs.

Try it / resources
- Overview and links: https://bfl.ai/models/flux-2-klein
- Demo/Playground + HF Spaces for 9B and 4B
- API, docs, GitHub, and open weights available (Apache 2.0 for 4B; NCL for 9B)

**FLUX.2 [klein]: sub-second, unified image gen + editing on consumer GPUs**

Black Forest Labs has released FLUX.2 [klein], a new family of compact flow models designed to bring high-quality text-to-image (T2I), image-to-image (I2I), and multi-reference generation to consumer hardware and edge devices. The release focuses on efficiency without specialized "big iron" infrastructure.

**Highlights:**
*   **Performance:** Capable of sub-0.5 second generation and editing on modern GPUs; distilled to just 4 inference steps.
*   **Model Variants:**
    *   **4B Variant:** Fully open source (Apache 2.0). Optimized for local/edge use, fitting within ~13GB VRAM (accessible on cards like the RTX 3090/4070+).
    *   **9B Variant:** Available under a Non-Commercial License (NCL). Positioned as the flagship efficient model balancing latency and quality.
*   **Unified Architecture:** A single model handles creation, editing, and blending, utilizing an 8B Qwen3 embedder for text understanding.
*   **Quantization:** Created in partnership with NVIDIA, offering FP8 and NVFP4 formats that significantly reduce VRAM usage (up to 55% less) and boost speed.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion on Hacker News focuses heavily on benchmarking the new [klein] models against Alibaba’s recently released **Z-Image Turbo**, which serves as the primary point of comparison for lightweight, local image generation.

*   **Efficiency vs. Capability:** Users debated the trade-offs of the new "small model" trend. While there is enthusiasm for running 4GB models locally (as opposed to unwieldy 100GB+ files), commenters noted that smaller models often suffer from **"knowledge gaps."** Users stress-testing the model found it struggled with complex physical logic prompts (e.g., "a tiger jumping on a pogo stick" or specific object interaction puzzles), areas where larger 32B+ models still dominate.
*   **Hardware and Accessibility:** A significant portion of the conversation revolved around hardware requirements. Users appreciated that the 4B model fits on **12GB consumer cards**, making it a viable alternative for users who cannot run full-sized Flux models. Some users also reported testing the web demos on mobile devices (Pixel, iPad, Samsung) with mixed success regarding browser compatibility.
*   **The "Speed" Use Case:** Commenters pointed out that sub-second inference isn't just about faster batching; it opens the door to **interactive/real-time workflows**, such as instant visual feedback loops and live previewing during editing, rather than the traditional "wait 10 seconds" generation cycle.
*   **Theoretical Compressed "World Models":** A side discussion emerged regarding the compressibility of visual data versus text. Users debated whether visual models have hit a "compression wall" regarding how much diverse visual reality can be encoded into small parameter counts compared to the relatively high compression efficiency of LLMs.

### Reading across books with Claude Code

#### [Submission URL](https://pieterma.es/syntopic-reading-claude/) | 126 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46650347)

Headline: An agent that weaves “idea trails” across 100 non-fiction books, from Jobs’ reality distortion to Theranos and The True Believer

Summary:
- Instead of using LLMs to compress text, this project uses Claude Code as an agent to help readers go deeper. It mines a library of 100 HN-favorite non-fiction books to build “trails”—sequences of excerpts that trace an idea across authors and eras.
- Example trail: Steve Jobs’ self-deception and “reality distortion field” → Theranos’ demo sleights in Bad Blood → startup cult dynamics in Zero to One → mass-movement psychology and necessary misrepresentation in The True Believer.

How it works:
- Books are chunked (~500 words) and auto-tagged into 100k topics, then rolled up into a quirky hierarchical tree (~1,000 top-level topics). It’s messy—think “Borgesian taxonomy”—but good enough to navigate ideas.
- CLI tools let the agent search topics, find co-occurrences across books, and browse neighboring topics/chunks.
- The agent operates in stages: propose novel trail ideas by skimming the topic tree, then dive to assemble and order excerpts to support an insight, finally adding highlights and explicit “edges” between excerpts.

What the author learned:
- Agentic > pipeline: A minimal prompt plus tool access (“find something interesting”) beat a hand-tuned multi-module pipeline. Pushing more into the agent loop reduced orchestration and improved results.
- Treat the AI like a coworker: Stop prompt-tweaking; build better tools and affordances. Ask the agent what it needs, watch logs, then upgrade the toolkit.
- Revision is cheap: The agent can refactor existing trails to new stylistic constraints (e.g., shorter excerpts) without regenerating everything, enabling faster iterative exploration.

Why it matters:
- A compelling pattern for LLM-powered reading: not summaries, but cross-book, cross-domain synthesis that surfaces serendipitous connections.
- Suggests a practical design lesson for AI tooling: give agents searchable structure, simple composable tools, and let them drive the exploration loop—even for non-coding tasks.

Caveats:
- The auto-generated taxonomy can be noisy or oddly specific; usefulness varies by topic.
- Quality rests on agent judgment when selecting and sequencing excerpts, so evaluation remains subjective.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Reading Philosophy vs. AI Utility**
A major debate emerged regarding the nature of reading. Critics argued that using AI to extract "truth" or summaries prioritizes the destination over the journey, effectively stripping non-fiction of the author's tone, pacing, and expression. However, defenders—including a self-described literature major—countered that this tool acts as a discovery mechanism or an analytical aid rather than a substitute. They argued it helps readers decide which books are worth their time and uncovers connections that human readers might miss.

**Agent Design and Technical Feasibility**
Users validated the author’s "agent as coworker" lesson, noting that treating the AI as a fast-reading colleague (focusing on tool-building rather than prompt-tweaking) is a "surprise moment" that improves results. There was technical discussion regarding hallucinations; while some remained skeptical of LLM accuracy, others noted that the project's approach—feeding the agent small, organized 500-word chunks rather than open-ended prompts—significantly reduces error rates.

**Better Recommendation Engines**
Commenters compared the project favorably to incumbents like Goodreads and Amazon. Users complained that current platforms rely on collaborative filtering (what other people bought) rather than semantic analysis of the complete text. Many expressed a desire for open-source alternatives that could index large local libraries (e.g., on a Raspberry Pi) to find content-based connections.

**Meta-Commentary on AI Criticism**
The thread contained several dismissive comments suggesting that people are unnecessarily "shoving LLMs" into reading. This prompted a moderator intervention warning against shallow dismissals and "curmudgeonly" reactions to people's work. This sparked a brief sub-discussion on the difference between Luddism and valid concerns about the automation of creative or intellectual consumption.

### Install.md: A standard for LLM-executable installation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.mintlify.com/blog/install-md-standard-for-llm-executable-installation) | 89 points | by [npmipg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=npmipg) | [108 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46652944)

Mintlify proposes install.md, a markdown spec for “LLM-executable” installation instructions. Instead of curl | bash, developers publish human-readable, structured steps that an agent can follow autonomously—with optional step-by-step approval and environment detection.

How it works:
- Add /install.md to your project (Mintlify now autogenerates and hosts it at <docs-url>/install.md; you can override or disable).
- Users pipe the file into an LLM or paste the URL; the agent adapts to OS/arch, runs commands, and verifies completion.
- Example call: curl -fsSL https://www.anaconda.com/docs/install.md | claude

Spec highlights:
- Strict headings and prompts: product H1, short description, an explicit “install this for me” instruction
- OBJECTIVE and DONE WHEN (clear success criteria)
- TODO checklist
- Step sections with code blocks
- EXECUTE NOW tying steps to the objective

Why it matters:
- Shifts install docs from human-oriented prose to agent-actionable recipes
- Safer/more transparent than piping executables; still readable by humans
- Lets developers encode edge cases without cluttering main docs

Availability:
- Live across Mintlify sites (e.g., Cerebras, Firecrawl, LangChain)
- Non-Mintlify projects can host install.md manually

Potential implications: smoother agent-led setup, clearer verification, and a path toward standardized, auditable automation for software installs.

The discussion around Mintlify’s `install.md` proposal centered on a conflict between **human readability** and **execution determinism**. While some welcomed a shift away from opaque `curl | bash` pipelines, many questioned the safety and efficiency of introducing a non-deterministic LLM into the installation path.

**Key arguments included:**

*   **Transparency vs. Determinism:** User `ptkmn` championed the idea as "Runtime Literate Programming," arguing that `install.md` allows developers to state *intent* clearly in English while letting the agent handle platform-specific logic (e.g., detecting AVX2 support or OS architecture). However, `cuu508` and `ctlfnmrs` countered that shell scripts, while ugly, are static and verifiable. They argued that trading determinism for a "black box" that might hallucinate instructions based on temperature or model updates creates a security and reliability nightmare.
*   **The "Build-Time" Compromise:** Several commenters (`nbdywllbsrv`, `chm`, `franga2000`) suggested that the LLM should be used to generate a shell script *from* the markdown primarily for the user to audit, or that the script should be pre-generated server-side. This would retain the ease of writing docs while preserving the efficiency and reproducibility of a standard shell script execution.
*   **Support & Efficiency:** `Szpadel` highlighted the "customer support hell" scenario: if an installation fails because an LLM interpreted instructions differently for one specific user (or model version), debugging becomes impossible. Others noted the inefficiency of using billions of parameters and expensive tokens just to copy binaries and set paths.
*   **Theoretical Implications:** The debate briefly touched on computer science theory, with `dng` citing Peter Naur’s "Programming as Theory Building," questioning whether natural language is too "lossy" to reliably replace code as the primary mental model for execution.

### Show HN: Gambit, an open-source agent harness for building reliable AI agents

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/bolt-foundry/gambit) | 89 points | by [randall](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=randall) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46641362)

Gambit (by bolt-foundry) is a local-first agent harness for building reliable LLM workflows by composing small, typed “decks” with explicit inputs, outputs, and guardrails—aimed at replacing monolithic prompts and brittle tool wiring.

Highlights
- Decks over chains: Break workflows into small, typed steps (“decks”) with clear IO; mix LLM calls and regular compute seamlessly.
- Typed by default: Define input/output schemas with Zod; validate at runtime to catch errors early and reduce orchestration brittleness.
- Local-first dev loop: Run via npx with REPL, streaming traces, and a built-in Debug UI/Simulator at localhost:8000; store sessions/traces under .gambit/.
- Observability baked in: Stream transcripts, view tool traces, grade sessions, and reproduce failures locally (JSONL traces, state persistence).
- Minimal boilerplate: Author decks in Markdown (model-powered) or TypeScript (compute/tools), then compose with child actions.
- Pragmatic IO strategy: Feed models only the per-step context; inject references/cards instead of dumping full RAG blobs to cut cost/hallucinations.
- CLI commands: run, repl, serve (debug UI), test-bot (personas), grade (saved sessions); --trace, --state, --verbose flags for diagnostics.
- TS library APIs: defineDeck/defineCard from JSR; spawn child decks with ctx.spawnAndWait and emit structured logs with ctx.log.
- Quickstart: Node 18+ and OPENROUTER_API_KEY; run examples with npx @bolt-foundry/gambit; supports OpenRouter-style endpoints.
- License: Apache-2.0.

Why it stands out: Gambit treats LLM orchestration like regular software—typed, composable, testable, and observable—providing a cleaner alternative to “one giant prompt + tools” setups common in LangChain-style stacks. It’s optimized for fast local iteration and predictable, debuggable runs.

Try it fast
- export OPENROUTER_API_KEY=...
- npx @bolt-foundry/gambit init
- npx @bolt-foundry/gambit repl gambit/hello.deck.md
- npx @bolt-foundry/gambit serve gambit/hello.deck.md (then open http://localhost:8000)

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Architectural Validation: Short-Lived vs. Long-Running**
The most active thread of discussion validated Gambit’s core philosophy: breaking workflows into short-lived, typed executors. Users with experience building agents (citing tools like GTWY.ai) noted that reliability issues often stem not from model quality, but from allowing agents to run too long, which causes them to lose context and drift. Commenters praised the explicit boundaries and "atomic containment" of logic, agreeing that code should handle orchestration and state management while LLMs should be restricted to small, focused steps.

**Comparisons and Positioning**
When asked how Gambit compares to **Mastra**, the creator (`rndll`) distinguished Gambit as an "agent harness" focused on defining intended behaviors (often via Markdown primitives) rather than just orchestrating TypeScript pipelines. While frameworks like **LangChain** and Mastra focus on computing tasks against an LLM, Gambit aims to make the "agent building" process itself simpler and more declarative. One user explicitly expressed relief at seeing a fresh architecture, criticizing LangChain’s complexity.

**User Experience and Feedback**
*   **hands-on testing:** One user (`lgrntmt`) reported playing with the tool for 24 hours, praising the separation of prompt and logic. However, they encountered friction with specific parameters (e.g., the model ignoring instructions to constrain summary length) and struggled to figure out how to load file contents for translation tasks.
*   **File System:** In response to feedback about file inputs, the creator noted they are working on "file system stuff" to support capabilities similar to Claude Code or Codex.
*   **Naming:** A user pointed out that "Gambit" is already the name of a well-known, long-standing open-source Scheme implementation.

### ChatGPT is getting ads. Sam Altman once called them a 'last resort.'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.businessinsider.com/chatgpt-ads-openai-2026-1) | 64 points | by [donpott](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=donpott) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46652024)

OpenAI will test ads in ChatGPT for free and Go users “in the coming weeks,” reversing Sam Altman’s 2024 stance that ads would be a “last resort.”

Key details
- Where ads appear: ChatGPT free and Go tiers only; Plus, Pro, Business, and Enterprise won’t see ads.
- OpenAI’s promises: ads will be clearly labeled; responses “will not be influenced by ads”; chat conversations won’t be shared with advertisers.
- Why now: OpenAI faces massive compute spending—about $1.4 trillion in data center and infrastructure commitments—and recently restructured into a more traditional for‑profit to attract capital.
- Leadership stance: Altman has softened on ads, saying the company must “take a lot of care to get right.” Fidji Simo (CEO of applications) says ads won’t influence answers and the company will be “extremely respectful” of user data.

Why it matters
- Trust vs. monetization: Ads inside a general‑purpose assistant raise concerns about subtle bias and targeting—even if answers aren’t “influenced,” placement and ranking could be.
- Business model pressure: Without Google/Meta‑scale ad businesses, OpenAI needs new revenue to fund compute; this brings it closer to the ad‑supported playbooks it once critiqued.

What to watch
- Ad format: inline “sponsored” cards vs. sidebar units; how “clearly labeled” looks in practice.
- Targeting and data policy: whether ad targeting uses behavioral signals without sharing raw chats; opt‑outs or controls for free users.
- Impact on UX and trust: user backlash, adoption of paid tiers to avoid ads, and any measurable changes in answer quality.
- Governance and regulation: disclosures, audits of “no influence” claims, and regional privacy compliance.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the user reaction:

**Skepticism and "Enshittification" Fears**
The prevailing sentiment is one of cynicism and disappointment. Many users view this move as the beginning of the "enshittification" of ChatGPT, drawing direct comparisons to the decline of Google Search. Commenters argue that despite OpenAI’s promises, the introduction of ads will inevitably incentivize the model to prioritize monetization over accuracy, creating conflicts of interest where answers are subtly influenced to drive sales. One user noted that while OpenAI claims "no influence," history suggests ads will eventually blend into results indistinguishably.

**Migration to Alternatives and Local LLMs**
The announcement has triggered a wave of interest in competitors. Common sentiments include:
*   **Switching:** Users are explicitly mentioning cancelling subscriptions or moving to **Claude**, **Gemini**, or **DeepSeek**.
*   **Local Models:** There is a significant push toward running local large language models (LLMs) to avoid surveillance and advertising entirely, provided the user has sufficient hardware.
*   **Trust:** Several users expressed that they would rather pay for a product directly (like a blank media tax or subscription) than deal with the "sycophantic" or manipulative nature of an ad-supported model.

**Privacy and Safety Contradictions**
A specific sub-thread highlighted the irony of LLMs being programmed to be excessively cautious regarding sensitive topics (like suicide prevention) while simultaneously preparing to aggressively sell products. Users worry that "content mining" for ad targeting effectively breaks the privacy of personal conversations.

**Proposed Alternatives to Standard Ads**
One user suggested a less intrusive model: instead of generic passive ads, OpenAI could offer an "opt-in" feature for hobbyists (e.g., "Gear Acquisition Syndrome" for musicians). In this scenario, the AI would proactively hunt for deals on specific items the user wants, making the ad valuable context rather than unwanted spam. However, most users remain doubtful that such nuance will be achieved.

- Use with OpenAI SDK by pointing base_url to http://localhost:8000/v1; API key optional for local.

Notes
- Apple Silicon only; leverages MLX and Metal kernels.
- Good fit for local dev, multimodal demos, and small-to-mid models with high throughput on Mac.
- Docs include guides for multimodal, audio, batching, MCP tools, and benchmarks.

**vLLM-MLX: vLLM-style, OpenAI-compatible local server for Apple Silicon**

**The Discussion**
Project creator **wybrrs** introduced the tool as a remedy for "painfully slow" inference frameworks on macOS, highlighting that vLLM-MLX leverages Apple's native MLX framework for GPU acceleration. They emphasized its ability to handle a single stack for text, image, video, and audio with continuous batching support that offers significant speedups for concurrent users.

The conversation began with hardware questions, as user **thebruce87m** asked about RAM requirements for older machines. Specifically, they wanted to know if a 16GB M1 Mac would be sufficient to run the models, noting that the memory usage numbers in the documentation seemed surprisingly low, likely due to heavy quantization.

### DuckDuckGo is asking for a Yes or No vote on AI

#### [Submission URL](https://duckduckgo.com/vote) | 45 points | by [jaredcwhite](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jaredcwhite) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46651155)

Title: “YES AI” or “NO AI” — a live public vote on the future of AI

What it is:
- A stark, referendum-style site asking the public to choose “YES AI” or “NO AI,” framed as giving people a direct say: “AI should be a choice. Did anyone ask you? Now someone is.”

Why it matters:
- Taps into the broader question of who gets to decide the trajectory of AI—companies, governments, or the public—and whether consent should be explicit.

What’s interesting:
- The simplicity is the point: a binary prompt meant to surface sentiment quickly.
- It raises immediate issues: what counts as “AI”? how would results be used? can a public web vote be representative or secure against bots/brigading?
- Highlights a desire for more democratic input into AI policy, even if the mechanism is rudimentary.

Takeaway:
- A provocative, minimalist attempt to measure public will on AI. The prompt is powerful; the governance mechanics are the real challenge.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the reactions to the "YES AI / NO AI" vote:

**Context & Skepticism**
*   **Identified as Marketing:** Users quickly identified the site as a DuckDuckGo (DDG) campaign (citing the URLs `yes.duckduckgo.com` and `no.duckduckgo.com`). Most view it as a marketing stunt or a "push poll" rather than a serious referendum on global AI governance.
*   **Ambiguity:** Commenters criticized the binary nature of the question. They argued the prompt lacks nuance: does "No" mean "no AI existence" or "don't force it into my search"? Does "Yes" mean "unfettered AI" or "helpful coding snippets"?
*   **Sampling Bias:** With the vote skewing heavily (96%) toward "NO," users pointed out that an internet poll targeting existing DuckDuckGo users—who are already privacy-conscious and wary of Big Tech—is inherently biased and unrepresentative of the general public.

**Strategic Implications for DuckDuckGo**
*   **Differentiation:** Some users praised the move as savvy product differentiation. With Google and Bing forcing AI integration, DDG positions itself as the alternative that offers user choice and transparency.
*   **Competitive Disadvantage:** Conversely, some argued that blind anti-AI sentiment is counter-productive. They believe DDG needs to offer optional, privacy-preserving AI tools (like search summarization) to remain a viable competitor to mainstream engines, rather than catering solely to "Luddite" impulses.

**Sentiment on AI**
*   **Distrust:** The "No" voters expressed deep distrust of corporate AI development, citing privacy invasions, "non-consensual" integration into daily life, and the unreliability (hallucinations) of current models.
*   **Utility vs. Hype:** The counter-argument suggested that AI hate is becoming emotionally charged and unreasonable. These users argued that as long as the features are optional (e.g., a "search assist" button), they provide objective value without harming the user experience.

### Starlink updates Privacy Policy to allow AI model training with personal data

#### [Submission URL](https://coywolf.com/news/startups/starlink-updates-tos-to-allow-ai-model-training-with-personal-data/) | 51 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46647716)

Starlink flips default to allow AI training on customer data; opt-out available

- What changed: Starlink updated its Global Privacy Policy on Jan 15, 2026 to allow sharing customers’ personal information with affiliates, service providers, and “third-party collaborators” to train AI models “including for their own independent purposes,” unless users opt out. All customers are opted in by default. Reported by Jon Henshaw (Coywolf).

- Why it matters: The “third-party collaborators” language and “independent purposes” carveout mean external companies can train models on Starlink customer data unless you disable it. Expect debate over consent-by-default, data scope, and potential compliance questions (e.g., GDPR/CCPA). Some speculate this could feed Musk’s Grok; Starlink hasn’t confirmed.

- How to opt out:
  - Web: starlink.com/account/settings → Edit Profile → scroll down → uncheck “Share personal data with Starlink’s trusted collaborators to train AI models.” → Save.
  - App: Menu → Profile → Account overview → Settings → Edit Profile → scroll down → uncheck the same setting → Save.

**Discussion Summary:**

Hacker News users analyzed the technical and legal implications of Starlink's policy update, focusing on the specific types of data exposed and methods for mitigation.

*   **Scope of Data Collection:** There was significant debate regarding what constitutes "personal information" in this context. While some users highlighted account-level data (billing address, GPS location, and photo IDs for age verification), others emphasized Starlink’s role as an ISP. Technical comments noted that Starlink can observe DNS queries and domains via Server Name Indication (SNI), painting a detailed picture of user behavior even without decrypting HTTPS traffic.
*   **Opt-Out Friction:** Users reported technical issues, noting that attempts to save the opt-out preference resulted in "An error occurred" messages. Others expressed frustration that while they receive marketing emails about data plans, they received no notification regarding this privacy shift.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** The consensus largely favored defensive measures. Several commenters recommended using a VPN specifically to blind the ISP (Starlink) to traffic data. Others argued for a "zero-trust" approach to cloud services in general, suggesting client-side encryption is the only barrier against sudden policy changes.
*   **Legal Ambiguity:** Commenters criticized the vague phrasing of "trusted collaborators" and "independent purposes." Comparisons were made to GDPR protections, with users noting that without strict regulations, "collaborators" could essentially mean any third party, from data consultancies to major ad-tech firms.

### Ads Are Coming to ChatGPT. Here’s How They’ll Work

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/openai-testing-ads-us/) | 23 points | by [thm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thm) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46649985)

OpenAI will start testing ads inside ChatGPT in the US “in the coming weeks,” a major shift for a product with an estimated 800M weekly users. Ads will appear in clearly labeled boxes below the bot’s answer and won’t be shown to Plus, Pro, or Enterprise subscribers. Free users and the new $8/month Go tier (rolling out in the US; already in India and France) will see the first placements, with a global expansion planned.

Key details
- Placement and influence: Ads sit below responses; OpenAI says they won’t affect what the model says.
- Targeting: Contextual matching to conversation topics; some personalization data may be used, but users can turn off data used for advertising and clear ad data at any time.
- Data handling: OpenAI says it won’t sell user data or expose chats to advertisers; advertisers get aggregate metrics (impressions, clicks).
- Safety limits: No ads on sensitive/regulated topics (health, mental health, politics). No ads to users believed to be under 18, aided by a forthcoming age-prediction model.
- Roadmap: Exploring interactive, conversational ad formats (e.g., ask an ad questions before purchasing).

Why it matters
- Monetization pressure: Despite massive usage and ~$64B raised lifetime, OpenAI’s revenue lags; ads are a predictable path, as seen with Google’s SGE and other large platforms.
- Trust vs. “enshittification”: OpenAI pledges user experience over revenue, but contextual targeting implies scanning conversation content, and ad creep is a familiar risk.
- Privacy knobs, real impact unclear: You can disable ad-personalization data, but contextual ads based on chat topics likely remain. The interplay with ChatGPT’s growing “memory” features will draw scrutiny.
- Regulatory watch: Age estimation for ad eligibility and the handling of sensitive topics will be closely examined.

What to watch
- Whether ads expand beyond Go/free tiers
- How “interactive ads” are implemented
- The effectiveness and transparency of privacy controls and targeting policies
- Any measurable influence of ads on response ranking or UX over time

**Discussion Summary**
The discussion reflects deep cynicism regarding OpenAI's trajectory and the introduction of advertising:

*   **Inevitable "Enshittification":** Users drew immediate parallels to Google’s evolution, expressing disbelief that ads will remain distinct from content or neutral regarding the model's output. While one commenter predicted a five-year timeline for this degradation, others argued OpenAI’s high cash burn and shift to for-profit status will accelerate the decline to within a year or even months.
*   **Subscription Vulnerability:** While ads are currently limited to Free and Go tiers, users threatened to cancel their Plus or Pro subscriptions if ads encroach on those services. Replies were pessimistic, predicting that paying users will eventually be served ads regardless of their tier.
*   **Alternatives:** Several users indicated they would switch to competitors like DeepSeek or Gemini if the ad experience becomes intrusive.
*   **Direct Interaction:** One user shared an anecdote about informing ChatGPT directly that they would leave the platform if advertised to, highlighting the disconnect between user sentiment and the platform's automated responses.
