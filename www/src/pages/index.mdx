#### [Submission URL](https://wiredream.com/llm-optimizing-digit-diff/) | 125 points | by [dgacmu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dgacmu) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42610234)

In his latest blog post, David G. Andersen dives into the intersection of large language models (LLMs) and coding efficiency, examining the potential of LLMs to optimize code. Using a task posed by Max Woolf—finding the difference between the smallest and largest numbers from a list of 1 million integers that sum to 30—Andersen evaluates the limits and capabilities of LLMs like GPT-4 and GitHub's Copilot.

Starting with an initial solution generated by Copilot in Python, which runs in 520 milliseconds, Andersen highlights how traditional code can benefit from better techniques and languages. He shifts gears to Rust, achieving impressive performance with an optimized digit sum function that reduces runtime to just 13.2 milliseconds—over a 12x improvement compared to Python. However, he uncovers that LLMs might miss critical optimizations, such as the importance of checking if a number is potentially useful before computing its digit sum.

Andersen emphasizes the value of human intuition in code optimization, showcasing how manual adjustments can lead to more significant efficiency gains than those suggested by LLMs. He also points out a major limitation of LLMs: their inability to run profilers to diagnose performance bottlenecks. In the end, he leaves readers pondering future possibilities—for instance, the idea of feeding profiling data back into an LLM to enhance its optimization capabilities. 

This exploration sheds light on the evolving relationship between AI tools and traditional programming practices, pushing for a collaborative approach to code optimization that leverages both human ingenuity and machine learning.
