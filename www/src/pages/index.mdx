### Ggml.ai joins Hugging Face to ensure the long-term progress of Local AI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/discussions/19759) | 786 points | by [lairv](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lairv) | [206 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47088037)

Headline: ggml.ai (team behind llama.cpp) joins Hugging Face to power the next phase of Local AI

What happened:
- Georgi Gerganov and the ggml.ai team are joining Hugging Face while continuing to lead and maintain ggml and llama.cpp full-time.
- The projects remain 100% open source and community-driven; technical decisions stay with the existing maintainers.
- Hugging Face will provide long-term resources to sustain and grow the ecosystem.

Why it matters:
- llama.cpp and the GGUF ecosystem have become a backbone for running powerful models locally on consumer hardware. This move shores up sustainability and accelerates support for new models and quantizations.
- It formalizes a productive collaboration: HF engineers have already contributed core features, multimodal support, an inference server/UI, additional architectures, GGUF compatibility, and integrations with HF Inference Endpoints.

What to expect next:
- Tighter, near “single-click” integration between transformers and ggml/llama.cpp for broader model coverage and easier validation.
- Better packaging and UX to make local model deployment simpler and more ubiquitous.
- Faster turnaround for new model support and quant releases.

Bigger picture:
- This is a clear bet on local inference as a serious alternative to cloud AI, aiming to build an efficient, open inference stack across devices—framed by both teams as a step toward widely accessible, open-source “superintelligence.”

Impact for developers and users:
- Smoother pipelines from transformers to GGUF/llama.cpp.
- Improved tooling and installers for desktop/server setups.
- Continued openness and community autonomy, with added stability and resourcing from HF.

Open questions to watch:
- Details of governance and roadmap prioritization under the new arrangement.
- How quickly new architectures and multimodal features flow through transformers → GGUF → llama.cpp.

Here is the daily digest summary for this submission and the accompanying discussion.

### **Top Story: ggml.ai (llama.cpp) joins Hugging Face**

**The Gist**
Georgi Gerganov and the team behind **ggml.ai** (the creators of **llama.cpp** and the **GGUF** file format) differ joining **Hugging Face**. The team will continue to work on their projects full-time with a commitment to keeping them 100% open-source and maintaining independent decision-making. Hugging Face is stepping in to provide the long-term resources and infrastructure needed to sustain the ecosystem.

**Why it Matters**
This consolidates the "local AI" stack. `llama.cpp` has become the standard for running LLMs on consumer hardware (MacBooks, gaming PCs, etc.). By officially aligning with Hugging Face, users can expect a seamless pipeline where new models uploaded to HF are immediately compatible with local inference tools (GGUF), along with faster support for new architectures and easier "one-click" deployment options.

### **Hacker News Discussion Summary**

The discussion on Hacker News focused heavily on the logistics of local AI, the sustainability of Hugging Face, and the technical nuance of quantization.

*   **Hugging Face as the "Real" OpenAI:** Commenters praised Hugging Face as the true champion of open-source AI, noting the immense, likely expensive service they provide by hosting petabytes of model weights for free. Several users expressed hope that HF has a sustainable business model so this resource doesn't disappear.
*   **The "Data Cap" Bottleneck:** A significant portion of the thread revolved around the practical struggles of local AI enthusiasts. Users reported downloading terabytes of models per week, triggering data caps from residential ISPs (like Comcast and AT&T). This led to a debate on why Hugging Face doesn't utilize **BitTorrent** to offload bandwidth costs. The counter-argument was that HF likely avoids torrents to maintain accurate download metrics (vanity metrics) and to manage access control for "gated" models (like Llama 3).
*   **Quantization Quality Control:** There was a technical exchange (involving Daniel Han of Unsloth) regarding the reliability of quantized models. Users expressed concern that aggressive quantization "lobotomizes" models in ways that are hard to detect with standard benchmarks (like perplexity). The consensus was that running comprehensive benchmarks on every quantization format is currently too expensive ($1k–$100k) for most open-source maintainers.
*   **East vs. West Open Weights:** A debate emerged regarding the quality of Western open models (like Mistral) versus Chinese open models (DeepSeek, Qwen, Kimi). Some users argued that Chinese models are currently winning on efficiency and reasoning benchmarks, while others countered that they still lack Western cultural knowledge and nuance required for tasks like creative writing or roleplay.

### Every company building your AI assistant is now an ad company

#### [Submission URL](https://juno-labs.com/blogs/every-company-building-your-ai-assistant-is-an-ad-company) | 258 points | by [ajuhasz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ajuhasz) | [135 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47092203)

Juno opens pre-orders for a local, always-on AI assistant—and argues ads make rival assistants a surveillance risk

- The pitch: Adam Juhasz says the next wave of assistants must be “always on”—hearing and seeing context across rooms, wearables, and time—to be truly proactive. Wake words are a dead end because the most valuable context happens in natural, unprompted conversations.

- The clash: He argues nearly every major assistant effort is now ad-funded, creating structural incentives to capture and monetize continuous audio/visual data. Policies can change; architectures can’t. “Policy is a promise. Architecture is a guarantee.”

- The remedy: Keep inference local. If models run on-device/in-home, there’s no API to hit, no telemetry to harvest, no data to subpoena. He cites Amazon’s Alexa/Ring histories as cautionary tales and notes OpenAI’s recent move to ads as a sign of where cloud-first models trend.

- Tech claim: The edge stack is “ready now.” A small, fanless box can run real-time STT, memory, reasoning, and TTS with acceptable quality for home tasks. Remaining issues are framed as memory architecture and context handling, not model size.

- The product: Juno’s Pioneer Edition—positioned as a local-first, always-listening home assistant—opens for pre-orders. The post doubles as a manifesto for on-device AI over ad-backed cloud assistants.

Why it matters: If “ambient AI” is inevitable, the business model and deployment architecture will decide who controls the feed from your life—users or advertisers. This piece argues a new category—local AI appliances—may be the only trustworthy path.

**The Discussion**
The comment thread centers on the tension between Juno’s privacy promises and the inherent risks of "always-on" recording, with the creator (`jhsz`) actively addressing technical concerns.

*   **Legal & Physical Risks:** Users argued that "local-only" does not equal "immune to law enforcement." Commenters like `zmmmmm` and `pxys` noted that unless the device is legally and technically resistant to compelled decryption (e.g., warrants), a box full of intimate family conversations is a liability. There were also concerns about what happens if the hardware is stolen or if Juno is acquired by a data-hungry conglomerate.
*   **The Creator's Defense:** `jhsz` engaged with critics, explaining that the system is designed to minimize long-term raw data storage (tuning memory to extract facts and "forget" the audio quickly) and relies on hardware-encrypted storage (Nvidia Jetson). They argued that while no solution is magical, data "inside the walls" is fundamentally safer than data in a corporate cloud.
*   **Target Audience Mismatch:** Several users (`BoxFour`, `bndrm`) pointed out a contraction in the pitch: the specific demographic that cares enough about privacy to buy a local AI appliance is often the same demographic that refuses to have *any* always-on microphones in their home, regardless of architecture.
*   **Philosophical Pushback:** The debate extended to the utility of "perfect memory." Citing Borges’ *Funes the Memorious*, some users questioned whether an AI that remembers every interaction is a helpful tool or a dystopian burden, suggesting that human forgetfulness is a feature, not a bug.

### The path to ubiquitous AI (17k tokens/sec)

#### [Submission URL](https://taalas.com/the-path-to-ubiquitous-ai/) | 791 points | by [sidnarsipur](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sidnarsipur) | [429 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47086181)

Taalas: turning models into chips for 10x faster, cheaper inference; launches hard‑wired Llama 3.1 8B at 17K tok/s

What’s new
- Taalas claims it can convert any AI model into custom silicon in ~2 months, producing “Hardcore Models” that are ~10x faster, ~20x cheaper to build, and ~10x lower power than GPU-based inference.
- First product: HC1 chip hard‑wiring Llama 3.1 8B, offered as a chatbot and inference API. Claimed performance: 17,000 tokens/sec per user (1k/1k input/output), outpacing Nvidia H200/B200 baselines and specialist stacks (Groq, SambaNova, Cerebras) in their chart.
- Design philosophy:
  - Total specialization: per‑model ASICs for maximum efficiency.
  - Merge storage and compute: single chip at DRAM‑level density to eliminate HBM, massive I/O, advanced packaging, liquid cooling.
  - Radical simplification: simpler systems = much lower total cost.
- Flexibility: configurable context window; supports fine‑tuning via LoRA. Gen‑1 uses aggressive 3‑/6‑bit quantization (some quality hit). Gen‑2 (HC2) moves to standard 4‑bit floating point with higher density/speed.
- Roadmap: mid‑sized reasoning LLM on HC1 this spring; “frontier” LLM on HC2 targeted for winter.

Why it matters
- If these numbers hold up, inference latency and cost could drop by an order of magnitude—key for real‑time agents and large‑scale deployment without ballooning data centers.
- It’s a bolder bet than general accelerators (e.g., Groq, Cerebras): a per‑model ASIC pipeline that trades flexibility for speed/efficiency, mitigated by a fast 2‑month turnaround and LoRA support.

Caveats/questions
- “Compute + DRAM‑density storage on one chip without exotic tech” is a big claim; details on process, concurrency, and memory architecture are sparse.
- Hard‑wiring weights risks rapid obsolescence as models evolve; economics hinge on how often new ASICs are spun and how broadly each model is adopted.
- Benchmark framing (tokens/sec per user, aggressive quantization) may mask throughput/quality trade‑offs; quality metrics vs GPU baselines aren’t shown.

How to try
- A beta chatbot demo and inference API for the HC1 Llama 3.1 8B are live.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Technical Speculation & Credibility**
*   Commenters analyzed the likely architecture, theorizing that Taalas is using specialized "mask ROM" fabrication where weights are stored via physical transistor traits (e.g., drive strength) rather than traditional memory cells. This enables single-transistor, 4-bit multiplication and massive density on mature nodes like TSMC 6nm.
*   While some were skeptical of the claimed 2-month "tape-out" turnaround, others noted the founders’ pedigree (veterans from Nvidia, AMD, and Tenstorrent), suggesting they have the specific expertise and connections to pull off such complex VLSI feats.

**Performance vs. The Status Quo**
*   Users distinguished Taalas’s metrics from Nvidia’s. While an H200 serves high throughput via massive batching (high latency per user), Taalas appears to offer massive throughput at very low latency (milliseconds) for single users.
*   The 17k tokens/second speed was described as a legitimate "quantitative change leading to a qualitative change," enabling real-time voice, video generation, and agentic workflows that current GPUs cannot handle efficiently.

**Strategic Use Cases: Speculative Decoding**
*   A significant portion of the debate focused on using these chips for **speculative decoding**. Instead of just being a standalone chatbot, the Taalas chip could serve as a "draft model" to rapidly generate tokens that are then verified by a larger frontier model, significantly speeding up the total inference of massive models.
*   Caveats were raised regarding tokenizer compatibility and whether the rigid nature of hard-wired chips allows them to pair effectively with evolving frontier models in this way.

**Risks & Environmental Concerns**
*   **Obsolescence:** The primary economic concern is whether a model remains relevant long enough to justify a dedicated hardware run. However, some argued that specific domains (robotics, control systems, basic coding) are stable enough to benefit from frozen, highly efficient models.
*   **E-waste:** Critics worried about the environmental impact of manufacturing chips that become useless once the model weights are outdated, comparing them to single-purpose ASIC miners or disposable tech.

### Pi for Excel: AI sidebar add-in for Excel

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/tmustier/pi-for-excel) | 104 points | by [rahimnathwani](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rahimnathwani) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47082854)

Pi for Excel: an open-source, multi-model AI sidebar that can read and edit your spreadsheets

What it is
- A Microsoft Excel add-in that embeds an AI agent directly in a sidebar. It can read your workbook, make changes, explain formulas, search the web, and run task-specific “skills.”
- Bring-your-own model: works with Anthropic (Claude), OpenAI, Google Gemini, GitHub Copilot, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. You can switch models mid-conversation.
- MIT-licensed. Repo: https://github.com/tmustier/pi-for-excel — Demo/site: https://pi-for-excel.vercel.app

Why it’s interesting
- Deep Excel tooling: 16 built-in actions the AI can call, including read/write ranges, fill formulas, trace dependencies, explain formulas, search across sheets, modify structure, apply formatting, manage comments, and even restore from automatic backups.
- Auto-context: before each turn the model gets a blueprint of your workbook, your current selection, and recent edits—so you don’t have to describe what you’re looking at.
- Safety and control: write operations have overwrite protection and auto-verification, with one-click revert via checkpoints.
- Extensible: install sandboxed sidebar extensions the AI can generate for you; integrates optional web search (Serper/Tavily/Brave) and an MCP gateway to connect custom tools.
- Power-user extras (behind /experimental): tmux bridge for local terminal control, Python/LibreOffice bridge, external skills discovery, stricter extension permissions.

How to use
- Install by sideloading the manifest (macOS and Windows instructions in the README). Click “Open Pi” in Excel’s ribbon.
- Connect a provider via API key or OAuth, or point it at a custom OpenAI-compatible gateway.
- Try prompts like “What sheets do I have?” or “Summarize my current selection,” then ask it to fill formulas or format ranges per your house style.

Dev setup
- Node 20 + mkcert for local HTTPS (Office.js requirement), Vite dev server, sideload the dev manifest. Quick-start steps are in the repo.

Caveats
- As with any LLM-powered Excel agent, workbook data you share may be sent to your chosen model/provider. Good fit if you want Copilot-like assistance but prefer open-source and BYO keys.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

*   **Origins and Inspiration:** The author (`tmstr`) joined the thread to explain that the project was built to bring the spirit of the open-source coding agent **Pia** to Excel. They noted that the tool uses a virtual filesystem and wraps specific "skills" to interact with the spreadsheet.
*   **Web Compatibility:** Users confirmed the add-in works on the web version of Excel (allowing use on Linux), provided the manifest is sideloaded via localhost. However, users noted that sideloaded dev-mode add-ins typically disappear after a week.
*   **Technical Constraints:** There was discussion regarding context window limits when handling large datasets. The author acknowledged that large tables currently overflow the context when passing results to the LLM, but mentioned optimizations and a potential Python bridge to handle larger sheets in the future.
*   **Deployment Headaches:** While users praised the modern Office JS API for functionality, several lamented the distribution process, describing the MS App Store and side-loading requirements as significant hurdles compared to the actual coding.
*   **Action vs. Text:** Users verified that the agent can perform functional tasks—such as creating charts and formatting tables—rather than just answering questions, with one user comparing the desired utility to an AI graphic designer that performs steps in Photoshop.
*   **Risks:** One user warned about API bans, claiming their Google account was banned after 48 hours of heavy usage with a similar tool, highlighting the risks of hitting consumer AI endpoints with automated tasks.

### Consistency diffusion language models: Up to 14x faster, no quality loss

#### [Submission URL](https://www.together.ai/blog/consistency-diffusion-language-models) | 215 points | by [zagwdt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zagwdt) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47083648)

Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) promise big speed gains for diffusion LMs without hurting quality. The team from SNU, UC Berkeley, and Together AI reports up to 14.5x lower latency on math and coding tasks by making diffusion decoding both more parallel and cache-friendly.

Why this matters
- Diffusion LMs refine masked text over multiple steps and can finalize multiple tokens per iteration, but in practice they’re slow: full bidirectional attention blocks KV caching, and many refinement steps are needed for quality.
- CDLM tackles both, pushing diffusion LMs closer to practical, high-throughput deployment while keeping their advantages (bidirectional context, infilling, refinement).

What’s new
- Exact block-wise KV caching for diffusion LMs: Train a student with a block-causal mask (attends to prompt, prior blocks, and current block) distilled from a fully bidirectional teacher. This preserves quality while enabling standard KV reuse for finished blocks.
- Reliable multi-token finalization: Within each block, the model confidently finalizes several tokens in parallel, reducing the number of refinement steps without degrading output.

How it works (post-training recipe)
- Trajectory collection: Run a strong bidirectional DLM as teacher to record token-by-token refinement trajectories and hidden states under a conservative setup (e.g., 256-token generations in blocks of 32, one token finalized per step) to capture high-quality signals.
- Train a block-causal student with three losses:
  - Distillation on newly unmasked tokens (match teacher’s reconstructed distributions).
  - Consistency on still-masked tokens (align intermediate predictions with block-complete predictions via stop-gradient).
  - Auxiliary masked-denoising (retain general masked-token and reasoning ability).
- Inference: Decode block-wise autoregressively with exact KV reuse for prompt and finished blocks; within a block, finalize tokens in parallel using a confidence threshold; early stop on EOS.

Results
- On Dream-7B-Instruct (a diffusion LM), CDLM achieves up to 14.5x latency speedups on math/coding benchmarks with comparable quality, using far fewer refinement steps.
- No extra heuristic knobs required; the gains come from the caching-compatible mask plus consistency-based multi-token finalization.

Takeaway
CDLM is a clean, post-training path to make diffusion language models fast enough to compete with autoregressive LMs in interactive settings—keeping diffusion’s bidirectional strengths while unlocking KV caching and parallel token finalization. Caveats to watch: the need for offline teacher trajectories and how well gains generalize beyond math/coding and the tested model size.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Technical Mechanisms and "Drafting" vs. Autoregression**
Users discussed the fundamental differences between Consistency Diffusion Language Models (CDLM) and standard Autoregressive (AR) models. `bpp` and others used analogies (referencing "British munchkin cats" and "inserting a refrigerator into a kitchen") to illustrate how diffusion models handle global context. Unlike AR models that generate tokens linearly (left-to-right), diffusion models treat text generation more like editing a draft—modeling the probability of the entire output structure simultaneously. This allows for infilling and correcting "invalid" structures that AR models struggle with. There was brief debate regarding hybrid AR+Diffusion models (citing LLaDA), with some analyzing whether combining them risks losing the reasoning benefits of pure diffusion.

**Model Sizing, Efficiency, and Data Quality**
The conversation shifted significantly when `MASNeo` expressed a desire for researchers to build larger models. `wngrs` and others countered that frontier models likely haven't grown substantially in parameter size over the last year or two. Instead, the industry focus has shifted to efficiency and data quality. `mgclhpp` cited technical reports from Qwen, noting that cleaner training data and longer pre-training allow smaller models (e.g., Qwen 2.5/3) to rival or outperform older, larger models. Users suggested the industry is moving toward "density" and "singularity"—highly efficient, smaller models correcting each other in parallel, rather than monolithic giants.

**Pricing Conspiracies and "Enshittification"**
A thread of skepticism emerged regarding the business practices of major AI labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). Users speculated that the lack of public parameter counts allows companies to maintain high pricing tiers ($20-$200/month) while actually serving cheaper, optimized models. `rthmsthms` and `bdbdbdb` argued that speed improvements often look suspiciously like "rebranded" models or silent downgrades to cut compute costs (enshittification), effectively keeping margins high while technological costs drop. Specific grievances were aired regarding the pricing and performance confusing between versions like Claude Sonnet 3.5 vs. 3.6 and Opus.

### Nvidia and OpenAI abandon unfinished $100B deal in favour of $30B investment

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ft.com/content/dea24046-0a73-40b2-8246-5ac7b7a54323) | 294 points | by [zerosizedweasle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zerosizedweasle) | [325 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47086980)

Nvidia and OpenAI reportedly ditch $100B mega-deal, pivot to $30B investment

What happened
- The Financial Times reports that Nvidia and OpenAI have abandoned an unfinished deal said to be worth around $100 billion, opting instead for a roughly $30 billion investment. The detailed terms aren’t public.

Why it matters
- A move from a single, gigantic commitment to a smaller one suggests both sides prefer staged, flexible financing and capacity build-out over an all-in mega arrangement.
- It could temper near-term expectations for OpenAI’s dedicated compute scale-up and keep Nvidia’s options open on who gets priority access to its next-gen GPUs.
- The shift may also reflect practical constraints (supply chains, regulatory scrutiny, financing costs) and a desire to avoid heavy concentration risk.

What to watch
- How the $30B is structured (equity stake, JV, supply pre-pays, or a mix).
- Any exclusivity or priority-allocation clauses for Nvidia hardware.
- Knock-on effects for OpenAI’s cloud partnerships and training timelines.
- Whether other financiers or hyperscalers step in to fill the gap.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the community's reaction:

**OpenAI’s "WeWork Moment" and the IPO Rush**
Much of the conversation draws a sharp comparison between OpenAI and WeWork. Commenters suggest OpenAI (and Anthropic) may be rushing toward an IPO to capitalize on "unlimited AI hype" before the market scrutinizes their lack of a clear path to profitability. Users expressed skepticism about the company's cost structure, viewing the pivot to a smaller investment deal as a potential signal that the "blind check" era of funding is ending.

**Nvidia: Enron, Cisco, or Just a Cyclical Bust?**
Speculation regarding Nvidia’s future was polarized. Some questioned if Nvidia could become "Enron 2.0" (referencing fraud), though this was largely dismissed because Nvidia sells tangible, high-demand hardware. A more popular comparison was Cisco or Sun Microsystems during the Dotcom boom—highly profitable companies that faced a massive correction when the bubble burst. There was debate over whether Nvidia could easily pivot back to selling GPUs to gamers if enterprise demand dries up, with some arguing that retreating from high-margin datacenter chips would be a painful restructuring.

**Tangible Assets vs. Model Weights**
A sub-thread contrasted OpenAI with SpaceX. Participants noted that SpaceX has tangible assets (rockets, Starlink satellites, launch infrastructure) and a clear moat, whereas OpenAI faces high operating costs with a product (LLMs) that some view as lacking the same defensive "hard tech" barriers.

**Hype Fatigue and Skepticism**
Calculated skepticism regarding AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is growing. Commenters noted that aggressive predictions about AI replacing white-collar work or programmers by 2024/2025 are already "aging like milk." Citations regarding Ed Zitron (a tech critic who predicted investment scale-backs) were shared, suggesting that while the technology is useful, the financial expectations attached to it may be decoupling from reality.

### 'A Big Fuck You to Big Tech': New Jersey Residents Defeat AI Data Center

#### [Submission URL](https://www.commondreams.org/news/new-brunswick-ai-data-center) | 53 points | by [abdelhousni](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=abdelhousni) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47094179)

Headline: New Jersey city kills AI data center, chooses public park instead

Summary: The New Brunswick, NJ City Council voted to cancel a planned 27,000-square-foot AI data center at 100 Jersey Ave and will add a public park to a redevelopment that already includes 600 apartments (10% affordable) and small-business warehouses. Hundreds packed the meeting to oppose the project, citing fears of higher electricity and water bills and environmental impacts. Local groups, including the NAACP, argued the facility would drain community resources. After the vote, residents celebrated; organizers framed the decision as prioritizing neighborhoods over Big Tech.

Why it matters:
- Signals rising local pushback to AI infrastructure over energy and water use, grid strain, and limited community benefits.
- May push data center developers toward stronger community benefit agreements, better transparency on resource use, and siting in areas with surplus power/water or on-site renewables.
- Highlights tension between tech-driven development, housing affordability, and public amenities.

What to watch:
- Whether developers appeal or relocate, and if future proposals include stronger environmental mitigations or utility guarantees.
- If other municipalities adopt stricter zoning or disclosure requirements for AI/data center projects.
- How New Brunswick funds and executes the park addition alongside the broader redevelopment.

Source: Common Dreams (Brett Wilkins), Feb 20, 2026.

**The Discussion**

The Hacker News discussion moves beyond New Brunswick's specific decision to a broader critique of the technology sector's relationship with the public and the power grid.

*   **Tech Fatigue:** Several users expressed that "Big Tech" has lost the "cool" factor it possessed during the 90s and 2000s (likening the old vibe to "sk8erboi culture"). Commenters described current tech giants as "soulless," "sanitized," and overly integrated into daily life, viewing them now as "the establishment" rather than exciting innovators.
*   **Data Center Value:** Participants debated the local value of data centers, describing them as "big ugly boxes" that employ few people compared to the space they occupy. One user contrasted them with nuclear plants which, despite risks, historically evoked a sense of national industrial pride that server farms lack.
*   **The Energy Dilemma:** A significant portion of the thread focused on whether cities could leverage data center demand to fund new power infrastructure (solar, battery, or nuclear) rather than banning them.
    *   **Skepticism of Commitments:** Critics argued that even if cities demand new power generation as a prerequisite, "energy is fungible" and corporations will use legal loopholes, subsidiaries, or financial derivatives to avoid delivering actual local capacity while still causing grid congestion.
    *   **Implementation Issues:** Others noted that solar requires expensive battery storage to be viable for 24/7 uptime and nuclear takes 15+ years to build, leading to fears that companies will simply revert to gas turbines or result in costs being "dumped onto regular people."
    *   **Regulatory Solutions:** Ideas were floated to strictly regulate business power rates or use performance bonds (seized if timelines aren't met) to enforce infrastructure promises, though skeptics maintained that a "blanket refusal" is often the only safe move for a municipality.

### AI is not a coworker, it's an exoskeleton

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kasava.dev/blog/ai-as-exoskeleton) | 416 points | by [benbeingbin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benbeingbin) | [412 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47078324)

Core idea: Treat AI as an “exoskeleton” that amplifies human judgment, not as an autonomous coworker. Framed this way, AI succeeds by handling scale and surfacing insights while humans make the calls. The post contrasts this with “agentic AI,” which often disappoints because it lacks the implicit context people carry.

Evidence via real exoskeletons:
- Manufacturing: Ford’s EksoVest cut injuries 83%; BMW reports 30–40% reduced effort with Levitate vests; German Bionic’s Cray X supports up to 66 lbs and customers saw 25% fewer sick days.
- Military: Sarcos Guardian XO Max delivers 20:1 strength amplification; Lockheed’s HULC supports ~200 lbs at ~7 mph sustained.
- Rehab: Meta-analysis found 76% of spinal cord injury patients could walk with powered exoskeletons (with crutches/walkers for balance).
- Running: Stanford showed a 15% energy cost reduction with an ankle exo; Harvard’s soft exosuit cut running metabolic cost by 5.4%.

Product application: Kasava positions its platform as an exoskeleton for product teams—deep commit analysis to spot technical debt and risks; large-scale transcript analysis to extract themes and pain points—while leaving prioritization and decisions to humans. The piece argues autonomous agents fail without organizational “connective tissue” (hinting at a “product graph” to encode that context).

Why it matters:
- Practical takeaway: capture and wire up org context; design AI to surface options, not make judgment calls.
- Counterpoint: agents can work in tightly scoped, well-instrumented domains, but broad autonomy still hits context walls.
- HN angle: a clear framing for building AI features users trust—and a reminder that “human-in-the-loop” is a product choice, not a fallback.

**The Debate: Stochastic Parrots vs. Useful Architects**
The discussion focused heavily on the definition of "reasoning" and the practical application of AI in software engineering, moving beyond the article's specific "exoskeleton" metaphor into the mechanics of how AI assists—or hinders—technical work.

*   **The "Architect" vs. The "Team":** One prominent perspective challenged the need for human teams, arguing that human collaboration has high "synchronization costs." This user suggested AI facilitates a shift where a single human "architect" with good taste can direct an "army of agents" or utilize AI for error correction and delegation, effectively acting as a massive lever for individual output.
*   **The Competence Barrier:** Countering the "easy automation" narrative, others likened AI coding to distinct skill levels. One commenter compared unskilled AI usage to a toddler with Play-Doh—making a mess without fundamental structural knowledge—working only when the user is a "competent sculptor" (skilled programmer) who can mold the raw material correctly.
*   **Reasoning vs. Autocomplete:** A heated debate emerged regarding whether LLMs possess true logic or are simply "text predictors."
    *   **Skeptics** noted that models often hallucinate (citing an anecdote about a model reading the clipboard and inventing a scenario) and make "non-human" mistakes, arguing they lack the context to find actual flaws.
    *   **Defenders** argued that if a model successfully navigates messy log files to produce working code fixes, the distinction between "reasoning" and "prediction" is effectively meaningless. One user cited mechanistic interpretability research (specifically regarding Anthropic’s models) to demonstrate that LLMs have specific internal feature representations for "bugs" and "unsafe code," suggesting a deeper internal logic than simple pattern matching.
*   **Human Reliability:** Several comments pushed back against the demand for deterministic AI, pointing out that human reasoning is also probabilistic and unreliable. The argument was made that AI doesn't need to be perfect, but simply needs to outperform the average human's consistency to be valuable, drawing parallels to safety thresholds for self-driving cars.

### Gemini 3.1 Pro

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/innovation-and-ai/models-and-research/gemini-models/gemini-3-1-pro/) | 902 points | by [MallocVoidstar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MallocVoidstar) | [871 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074735)

Google announces Gemini 3.1 Pro, pushing “core reasoning” and agentic workflows

- What’s new: An upgraded core model meant for complex, multi-step tasks, rolling out across Google’s consumer and developer products.
- Headline claim: Scores 77.1% (verified) on ARC-AGI-2, more than double Gemini 3 Pro’s reasoning performance, per Google.
- Demos/use cases: 
  - Generates website-ready animated SVGs from text.
  - Builds a live ISS telemetry dashboard by wiring a public API to a visualization.
  - Codes an interactive 3D starling murmuration with hand tracking and a generative score.
  - “Creative coding” that translates literary themes (e.g., Wuthering Heights) into site design and behavior.
- Availability: 
  - Developers (preview) via Gemini API in AI Studio, Gemini CLI, Google Antigravity, and Android Studio.
  - Enterprises via Vertex AI and Gemini Enterprise.
  - Consumers via the Gemini app and NotebookLM (Pro/Ultra; higher limits in the app, NotebookLM access limited to Pro/Ultra).
- Context: Follows last week’s “Gemini 3 Deep Think” update; 3.1 Pro is in preview as Google iterates on more ambitious agentic workflows before general availability.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

*   **Claude Remains the Coding Favorite:** A significant portion of the discussion contrasts Gemini unfavorably with Anthropic’s Claude. While users acknowledge Gemini’s raw reasoning speed, developers report getting "stuck in loops" and struggling with poor tooling integration. One former Googler described their current workflow as "Plan in Gemini, Execute in Claude," implying Google has captured the reasoning aspect but Anthropic currently owns the developer experience.
*   **Strategic Focus (OpenAI vs. Anthropic):** Commenters suggest that while Google is busy fighting an existential war against OpenAI to protect Search, they are inadvertently leaving the high-value "enterprise and coding" door open for Anthropic. However, defenders note that Google’s "messy" product launches are typical for the company, and its vertical integration (owning the TPUs and data centers) gives it a long-term economic advantage that competitors reliant on Nvidia chips lack.
*   **Performance & Hallucinations:** User reports on the new model's accuracy are mixed. Some anecdotal evidence suggests the new preview hallucinates more than Gemini 3.0, while others cite benchmarks (like the AA-Omniscience Index) to argue that 3.1 is technically an improvement, leading to a debate on how these benchmarks apply to real-world usage.
*   **Safety & Refusals:** There is conflicting feedback regarding safety filters. While some users complain about Google’s strict refusal to answer certain prompts (e.g., SSH keys), others note that they have recently found ChatGPT to be more puritanical, occasionally switching to Gemini specifically because it was willing to answer questions OpenAI refused.

### Measuring AI agent autonomy in practice

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/research/measuring-agent-autonomy) | 109 points | by [jbredeche](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jbredeche) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47073947)

Measuring AI agent autonomy in practice (Anthropic): Anthropic analyzed millions of interactions across Claude Code and its public API to see how autonomously agents run in the wild, how humans oversee them, and where they’re used.

- Autonomy is rising: In the longest Claude Code sessions, uninterrupted work time nearly doubled in three months—from under 25 minutes to over 45—an increase that appears driven by usage patterns/UX as much as model upgrades.
- Oversight is shifting: Experienced users enable full auto-approve in 40%+ of sessions (vs ~20% for new users) yet interrupt more often—letting agents run, then stepping in when it matters. On complex tasks, Claude Code pauses to ask for clarification more than twice as often as humans interrupt it.
- Where agents act: Most API-side actions are low-risk and reversible. About half of agentic activity is software engineering, with early but growing use in healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity.
- How they measured: API traffic was analyzed at the tool-call level (no session stitching), while Claude Code provided end-to-end session timelines; autonomy was proxied by turn duration, with caveats.

Why it matters: As agent autonomy grows, Anthropic argues for new post-deployment monitoring and human–AI interaction paradigms so people and agents can manage autonomy and risk together.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments on Hacker News:

**Critique of Metrics and Methodology**
The most prominent criticism focuses on Anthropic's decision to use "turn duration" (specifically the increase from 25 to 45 minutes at the 99.9th percentile) as a proxy for autonomy. Users argued this metric is heavily flawed because:
*   **Hardware dependency:** Duration correlates with compute speed; the same task takes vastly different amounts of time on a Raspberry Pi versus a Groq chip, making time a "gibberish measurement" without controlling for token speed or output quality.
*   **Cherry-picking:** Critics noted that highlighting the 99.9th percentile (the extreme tail) looks like cherry-picking outliers rather than representing the average user experience.
*   **Better alternatives:** Commenters suggested that true autonomy should be measured by "authorization scope" (success within permission boundaries) or the complexity of tasks handled without human intervention, rather than raw time.

**Privacy and Telemetry Concerns**
There is significant skepticism regarding user privacy. Several commenters believe the push for "agentic" coding via Claude Code is primarily a method to harvest telemetry for training data. Users expressed distrust in "privacy-preserving" features (like the mentioned specific research tool "Clio"), arguing that even if personal speech is removed or summarized, the storage of that derived data still poses a security risk and benefits the company more than the user.

**Model Consistency and "Overthinking"**
Users reported frustrated experiences with recent model behavior, suspecting silent backend changes to balance costs or game benchmarks.
*   Some noted that models seem to vary wildly in quality from day to day or hour to hour.
*   Others mentioned that "thinking" models (like Opus) sometimes overthink simple tasks, burning tokens unnecessarily, leading some users to switch back to previous versions or disable thinking modes for efficiency.

**The "Dead Internet" Meta-Discussion**
A subset of the discussion focused on the comment thread itself, with users claiming to spot "green-named" (new) or previously dormant accounts posting generic, bot-like responses. This fueled a sentiment that AI agents are already "clogging up" the commons and poisoning the very platforms discussing their regulation and monitoring.

### Anthropic officially bans using subscription auth for third party use

#### [Submission URL](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/legal-and-compliance) | 641 points | by [theahura](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theahura) | [765 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069299)

Anthropic clarifies Claude Code legal, auth, and compliance rules

What’s new
- Terms: Enterprise/API users fall under Commercial Terms; Free/Pro/Max under Consumer Terms. Existing commercial agreements apply whether using Claude directly or via AWS Bedrock/Google Vertex.
- Healthcare: A Business Associate Agreement automatically covers Claude Code if the customer has an executed BAA and Zero Data Retention (ZDR) is enabled; applies to that customer’s API traffic through Claude Code.
- Usage: Subject to Anthropic’s AUP. Pro/Max usage limits assume ordinary, individual use across Claude Code and the Agent SDK.
- Authentication: Consumer OAuth tokens (Free/Pro/Max) are only for Claude Code and Claude.ai. Using them in other products/services—including the Agent SDK—or proxying user traffic through Claude.ai credentials is prohibited. Developers must use API keys from Claude Console or supported cloud providers. Anthropic may enforce without notice.
- Security: Trust Center and Transparency Hub are the references; vulnerabilities go through HackerOne.

Why it matters
- Shuts down gray-market “log in with Claude.ai” or credential-proxy tools.
- Provides a clear compliance path for healthcare workloads (BAA + ZDR).
- Reduces legal ambiguity for third-party builders on the Agent SDK and cloud marketplaces.

Action items for devs and teams
- If you’re integrating Claude or the Agent SDK, provision API keys—don’t rely on user OAuth.
- Audit any tool that asks users to sign in with Claude.ai; it likely violates the ToS.
- For HIPAA use, confirm BAA is executed and enable ZDR before routing through Claude Code.
- Point security teams to the Trust Center/Transparency Hub and set up HackerOne reporting.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Strategic Lock-in vs. Developer Freedom**
The discussion focused heavily on the business signals behind Anthropic’s technical restrictions. Many users view the move as an attempt to "capture value" and create platform path dependency—comparing the strategy to Apple’s walled garden or Microsoft’s OS dominance—rather than purely technical necessity. Commenters argued that by coupling the frontend (Claude Code) tightly with the model usage, Anthropic is trying to prevent their backend models from becoming a fungible commodity.

**The "Bloat" vs. DIY Debate**
A significant portion of the conversation revolved around the efficiency of the Claude Code tool itself.
*   **Performance:** Several developers critiqued the official CLI as "slow" and "bloated."
*   **Simplicity:** Users shared anecdotes of building their own minimal coding agents (e.g., "100 lines of code and tmux controls") that they feel outperform the official harness.
*   **The "Bitter Lesson":** Some invoked Rich Sutton's "Bitter Lesson," suggesting that complex, hand-engineered software harnesses (like Claude Code) will eventually lose out to general, compute-driven approaches.

**Risk of Accelerating Competitors**
Commenters warned that strictly enforcing these rules might backfire.
*   **Fungibility:** There is a sentiment that LLMs are becoming interchangeable artifacts. If Anthropic makes access too difficult or expensive (forcing API keys over OAuth convenience), developers may simply switch to competitors or open-source alternatives that offer more flexibility.
*   **Innovation:** Users argued that banning "gray market" integrations (using web-auth for third-party tools) stifles the ecosystem and "burns developer loyalty" in favor of short-term corporate control.

### AI makes you boring

#### [Submission URL](https://www.marginalia.nu/log/a_132_ai_bores/) | 660 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [359 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47076966)

AI makes you boring (Opinion) — Posted 2026-02-19

- Thesis: The surge of AI-assisted “vibe-coded” Show HN projects has boosted volume but hollowed out depth. Pre-AI, demos sparked rich conversations because creators had wrestled with problems; now many feel shallow and interchangeable.
- Core argument: Offloading thinking to LLMs dampens originality. Models are good at smoothing ideas, not generating novel ones; relying on them yields surface-level outputs that feel smart but aren’t. Using AI to explore unfamiliar ground can help, but it’s a “fatal flaw” for original work like posts or products.
- Rebuttal to “human-in-the-loop”: Original ideas emerge from doing the hard, messy work AI replaces. Steering an LLM doesn’t restore depth; it nudges human thought toward AI’s averaged patterns.
- Process matters: Articulation—writing, teaching, grinding through a problem—refines ideas. Prompting isn’t articulation; the output is disposable without the thinking behind it. Metaphor: you don’t build muscle by having an excavator lift your weights; you don’t get interesting thoughts by letting a GPU think for you.
- Why it matters: Beyond HN, AI risks homogenizing programming discourse and product ideas, trading hard-won insight for quick, forgettable demos.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The Maintenance Debt of "Vibe Coding"**
The discussion centered on the distinction between *running* code and *reading* it. While some users argued that code is primarily an executable tool and that AI is excellent for removing the drudgery of "boring" implementations, others countered that code must eventually be read to be maintained. User `fhd2` and others pointed out that if a creator doesn't have the time to write the code, they likely won't have the understanding required to fix it when it breaks. This led to comparisons between AI-generated code and "minified" or closed-source code—functional black boxes that are hostile to debugging.

**Reliability vs. "Good Enough"**
A debate emerged regarding the stakes of software development. User `zm` argued that 90% of software (e.g., CRUD apps) is not life-critical, contrasting it with the infamous Therac-25 incidents, and suggested that strict reliability matters less than shipping. `bstmm` and others pushed back, noting that reliability is often the difference between high-value software (banking) and cheap disposable tools. They warned that AI introduces subtle logic errors (like using floating-point math for currency) that "vibe coders" might miss until it's too late.

**The Productivity Trap**
Several commenters shared anecdotes about AI in professional settings. User `rwn` noted that coworkers using AI generators doubled their feature output but increased the volume of code (line changes) by 10x, resulting in a team that was "less able to work" or self-correct because they didn't understand the bloat they were committing. The consensus among skeptics was that AI encourages treating software like "cheap, Chinese-made widgets"—fine for disposable one-offs, but a liability for professional-grade engineering.

### AI made coding more enjoyable

#### [Submission URL](https://weberdominik.com/blog/ai-coding-enjoyable/) | 95 points | by [domysee](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=domysee) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47075400)

AI as the bore-b-gone for coding grunt work

- A developer describes offloading the “typing exercise” parts of software engineering to LLMs: error handling, input validation, plumbing properties through layers, and handling many type-specific branches.
- Tests are the key workflow: they design for testability, write one exemplar test to set style and expectations, then have the AI generate the rest of the cases.
- One red line: they don’t trust LLMs for literal copy-paste edits, fearing subtle, undetectable drift when the model “re-creates” code instead of pasting it verbatim.
- Net result: major reduction in tedium and faster iteration; AI shines at boilerplate and repetitive patterns while the human focuses on design and tricky paths.
- Implicit takeaway: use AI where a clear pattern/spec exists (tests as oracle), and reach for deterministic tools (codemods, refactors, patches) when exactness matters.

While the submission praises AI for removing tedium, the discussion highlights a divide between developers who prioritize "shipping" and those who prioritize "craft," with significant concerns regarding long-term code comprehension.

**Key themes in the discussion:**

*   **The "Video Game" Metaphor:** Several users argued that writing the "boring" parts (tests, boilerplate) is the primary way developers build a mental model of the system. Offloading this to AI was likened to "watching a video game instead of playing it"—you get to the end, but you miss the experience and understanding gained through the struggle.
*   **Code Review vs. Code Generation:** A recurring sentiment is that reviewing code is cognitively harder than writing it. Users fear that AI optimizes the "cheap" task (generating lines of code) while exponentially increasing the "expensive" task (debugging and reviewing logic you didn't write). There is concern that this leads to "functioning but not understood" technical debt.
*   **Product vs. Craft:** The thread split into two philosophical camps:
    *   **The Pragmatists:** Argue that business value is tied to the *product*, not the code. If AI accelerates the result, "losing" the coding process is acceptable. This group included time-poor developers (e.g., new parents) who found AI essential for actually finishing personal projects.
    *   **The Craftsmen:** Argue that if you enjoy the act of coding, AI removes the fun. One user noted an ironic inversion: they love writing small, logical methods and hate high-level architecture; AI forces them to do the architecture while robbing them of the logic puzzles they enjoy.
*   **Skill Atrophy:** Commenters expressed concern that skipping manual implementation (like setting up Linux servers or writing basic algorithms) stops the deepening of technical knowledge, turning developers into "no-code" platform operators.

### Step 3.5 Flash – Open-source foundation model, supports deep reasoning at speed

#### [Submission URL](https://static.stepfun.com/blog/step-3.5-flash/) | 222 points | by [kristianp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kristianp) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47069179)

StepFun drops Step 3.5 Flash: an open-source MoE that aims for frontier reasoning at real-time speeds

Highlights
- Architecture and speed: 196B-parameter sparse MoE with only 11B active per token (“intelligence density”). Uses 3-way Multi-Token Prediction to hit 100–300 tok/s in typical use (peaks ~350 tok/s on single-stream coding).
- Long context: 256K window via a 3:1 Sliding Window Attention to full-attention ratio, targeting lower compute while keeping quality on long codebases/docs.
- Agent/coding focus: RL-trained for stability on long-horizon tasks; scores 74.4% on SWE-bench Verified and 51.0 on Terminal-Bench 2.0; 86.4 on LiveCodeBench-V6.
- Reasoning: Near-SOTA on math olympiad style tasks—AIME 2025 at 97.3 (99.9 with PaCoRe/parallel thinking) and HMMT 2025 at 96.2; 85.4 on IMOAnswerBench.
- Agents and browsing: 88.2 on τ²-Bench; 69.0 on BrowseComp (with Context Manager).
- Overall standing: Average score across eight benchmarks is 81.0—competitive with top proprietary models (e.g., Gemini 3.0 Pro 80.7, Claude Opus 4.5 80.6) and just behind GPT-5.2 xhigh at 82.2. It trails some closed models on specific tasks (e.g., Claude on Terminal-Bench).
- Local deployment: Positioned for high-end consumer hardware (e.g., Mac Studio M4 Max, NVIDIA DGX Spark) with code/weights slated across GitHub, HuggingFace, and ModelScope; tech report and OpenClaw Guidance mentioned.

Why it matters
- Pushes open-source models closer to “agent-ready” territory: fast generation, long context, and robust coding/terminal competence.
- MoE + MTP-3 delivers a rare combo of throughput and reasoning depth, making local private agents more practical.

Caveats
- Vendor-reported results; averages exclude xbench-DeepSearch where it lags (56.3 vs ChatGPT-5-Pro 75.0).
- “PaCoRe/parallel thinking” gains come with extra test-time compute.
- Real-world latency/throughput depend heavily on user hardware and deployment stack.

**StepFun drops Step 3.5 Flash: an open-source MoE that aims for frontier reasoning at real-time speeds**
https://huggingface.co/StepFun/Step-3.5-Flash-GGUF

StepFun has released Step 3.5 Flash, a 196B-parameter sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model with 11B active parameters per token. Aiming for "intelligence density," the model utilizes 3-way Multi-Token Prediction to achieve generation speeds of 100–300 tokens per second. It features a 256K context window using a sliding window attention mechanism to maintain performance on long documents and codebases. The model is positioned as an agent-ready solution, scoring competitively on coding benchmarks like SWE-bench Verified (74.4%) and reasoning tasks like AIME 2025 (97.3%). It is designed for local deployment on high-end hardware, with weights available on HuggingFace and GitHub.

**Discussion Summary**

The discussion focuses heavily on the practicalities of running such a large model locally, specifically regarding hardware requirements, recurring bugs, and the economics of self-hosting versus using APIs.

*   **Local Hardware and Performance:** Users confirm the model runs well on high-end Apple Silicon systems (M1 Ultra, M3 Max) with 128GB+ RAM using 4-bit quantization. Reported speeds are around 36 tokens per second on an M1 Ultra, with users praising the "intelligence density" compared to other local models like Minimax 2.5 and GLM-4.
*   **Infinite Loop Bug:** A significant portion of the feedback concerns an "infinite reasoning loop" issue. While initially suspected to be a `llama.cpp` engine bug (potentially mishandling format tags or "thinking" tokens), some users reported reproducing the issue in the official chat UI, suggesting it may be an intrinsic flaw in the model weights.
*   **Agentic Capabilities and Comparisons:**
    *   Users debating its coding utility found it handles local CLI harnesses better than Qwen 2.5 Coder in some instances, though others noted it can struggle with explicit tool-calling instructions compared to models like Nemotron.
    *   While reasoning is praised in some contexts (solving riddles), others found it prone to hallucinations on niche logic queries (e.g., Pokémon deck mechanics) where models like Claude Opus or DeepSeek succeed.
*   **Benchmark Skepticism:** There is debate regarding the Terminal-Bench 2.0 score (51.0); while some users felt this was low, others contextualized it as valid near-SOTA performance given the difficulty of the benchmark. However, critics argued that Terminal-Bench often tests syntax memorization rather than true agentic reasoning.
*   **Economics of Self-Hosting:** A sidebar discussion analyzed the cost-benefit of purchasing $10,000+ hardware (e.g., M3 Ultra with 512GB RAM) versus paying for APIs. The consensus leaned toward APIs being cheaper for most users unless privacy or 24/7 heavy utilization are the primary factors.

### How AI is affecting productivity and jobs in Europe

#### [Submission URL](https://cepr.org/voxeu/columns/how-ai-affecting-productivity-and-jobs-europe) | 169 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [131 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47068320)

Europe’s AI paradox: lagging invention, solid deployment — and a measurable payoff

- What’s new: A study of 12,000+ EU firms (EIBIS + Orbis) claims the first causal estimate of AI’s impact on firm performance in Europe. Using a Rajan–Zingales-style instrument, the authors match each EU firm to similar US firms and use US AI adoption as an exogenous shock to identify effects.

- Key findings:
  - AI lifts labour productivity by about 4% on average — economically meaningful, but far from “instant productivity boom” territory.
  - No evidence of job losses from adoption in the short run, suggesting AI is acting as a complement rather than a direct substitute for labour.
  - Adoption parity masks big divides:
    - Financially developed EU countries (e.g., Sweden, Netherlands) match US adoption (~36% of firms in 2024).
    - Less financially developed EU economies (e.g., Romania, Bulgaria) lag (~28%).
    - Big-firm edge: 45% of large firms use AI vs 24% of small firms.
  - Adopters already look different: they invest more, innovate more, and face tighter skill bottlenecks — hence the need for causal methods.

- Why it matters: AI is delivering real, near-term efficiency gains in Europe without immediate employment cuts, but benefits concentrate in larger firms and financially stronger countries — a recipe for widening gaps unless policy focuses on diffusion (SMEs), skills, and access to finance/infrastructure.

- Caveats: Effects are on labour productivity levels (short-run) rather than long-run TFP growth; adoption is partly survey-based; heterogeneity across countries and sectors remains large.

While the submission focuses on the economic and productivity impact of AI adoption in Europe, the comment text pivots to a debate on the reliability of the metrics used and whether AI’s perceived utility is actually a symptom of failing legacy tools.

**Critique of Innovation Metrics**
Discussion opens with skepticism regarding the study's use of patent data to measure AI specialization. Commmenter **gyl** argues that comparing EU and US patent numbers is flawed because EU law has historically been much stricter regarding software patents. Others suggest that a surge in patents often signals patent trolling or speculative investment rather than genuine innovation, with **cor_NEEL_ius** warning that verifying AI-generated output (which often hallucinates) can actually create new productivity costs.

**The "Search is Broken" Thesis**
The majority of the thread argues that AI feels productive primarily because traditional web search has degraded.
*   **Decline of Search:** Users like **m463**, **mnkpt**, and **adrian_b** expres deep frustration with modern search engines (specifically Google) for ignoring Boolean operators, fuzzy-matching specific terms (returning "Hoodoo" for "Xoodoo"), and prioritizing SEO-spam and ads over direct answers.
*   **AI as a Refuge:** In this context, AI is viewed as a "cleaner" alternative for cutting through "corporate obfuscation" to find simple facts (e.g., car pricing) without clicking through ad-laden pages.

**Skepticism and Future Outlook**
Despite the current utility of AI over search, the mood remains cynical:
*   **Hallucination vs. Noise:** **CamelCaseCondo** counters that while search is noisy, AI is dangerous due to confident hallucinations, citing difficulties using LLMs for technical schematics where "close enough" is useless.
*   **The Cycle of "Enshittification":** **Wobbles42** and **luke5441** predict that the productivity boost is temporary. They anticipate that LLMs will eventually succumb to the same forces that ruined search: sponsored content, "SEO" manipulation of training data/context windows, and a flood of AI-generated spam, ultimately negating the efficiency gains currently being celebrated.

### I traced 3,177 API calls to see what 4 AI coding tools put in the context window

#### [Submission URL](https://theredbeard.io/blog/i-intercepted-3177-api-calls-across-4-ai-coding-tools/) | 31 points | by [theredbeard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theredbeard) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47073237)

What happened
- Frustrated by ballooning token bills, the author built Context Lens, a tracer that records exactly what LLM coding tools put in their context window each turn.
- He planted a small bug in Express.js (res.send(null) returning the string "null" with JSON content-type instead of an empty body) and asked four tools to find/fix it and run tests.
- All four fixed the bug and passed 1,246 tests—but their context strategies and token usage were dramatically different.

Who and how
- Models tested via CLI: Claude Code Opus, Claude Code Sonnet, “Codex (GPT-5.3)” and Gemini 2.5 Pro.
- Context Lens broke down tokens by category: tool definitions, tool results, system prompt, and user conversation; it also tracked per-turn totals.

Key results
- Total tokens (mean; range across runs):
  - Opus: ~27K (23–35K), tight and consistent.
  - Sonnet: ~50K (43–70K), broader reads.
  - Codex: ~35K (29–47K), moderate variance.
  - Gemini: ~258K (179–351K), huge variance with no convergence.
- Peak-context composition:
  - Opus: 69% tool definitions (16.4K); only 1.5K in actual tool results. “Architectural tax” from re-sending tool definitions every turn. Caching helps (≈95% hits after the first turn).
  - Sonnet: Similar Claude overhead (18.4K tool defs, 43%) plus heavy reads (16.9K tool results, 40%); even read an entire 15.5K test file.
  - Codex: Minimal tool-def overhead (6%); most tokens go to tool results (72%).
  - Gemini: 0% tool-def overhead (server-side tools) but extremely aggressive reads—96% tool results. One turn pulled 118.5K tokens by dumping the full git history of a file.
- Gemini ran the same number of API calls in low and high runs but chose very different, data-heavy paths each time. Its 1M context window and cheaper tokens are caveats, but the strategy still burns a lot of context.

Why it matters
- Same quality, very different costs: tool design choices (prompted tool definitions vs. server-side tools, caching, retrieval breadth) dominate token spend.
- Big context windows invite sloppy retrieval; developers pay for it.
- Instrumentation like Context Lens surfaces hidden overheads (e.g., repeated tool definitions, unbounded diffs/histories) so teams can rein them in.

Notable footnotes
- Claude uses Haiku subagents for small tasks; they don’t share cache with the main Opus calls.
- The author observed no “settling” pattern in Gemini’s runs—each took a fresh, often heavier route.

Takeaways for practitioners
- Measure per-turn context composition; set budgets and guardrails for tools (cap diffs/histories, prefer targeted reads).
- Exploit caching where available; avoid re-sending large static tool definitions.
- Bigger, cheaper context is not a free lunch—strategy beats window size.

**Discussion Summary**

Commenters praised the analysis and the name of the author's tool, "Context Lens." The limited discussion focused on technical specifics, including:
*   **Model Behaviors:** One user noted that Opus and Codex are particularly strong at reading code and diagnosing bugs, observing that telling Opus a feature "worked recently" effectively prompts it to inspect git history.
*   **Version Confusion:** There was some confusion regarding the specific model versions and release timelines being compared, likely due to the fast pace of recent LLM updates (e.g., Gemini 2.5 vs. recent Claude releases).

### Grok Exposed a Porn Performer's Legal Name and Birthdate–Without Being Asked

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/grok-doxing-real-names-birthdates-siri-dahl/) | 56 points | by [latexr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=latexr) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47077656)

404 Media reports that xAI’s Grok surfaced porn performer Siri Dahl’s full legal name and birthdate to users without being prompted, blowing up a decade of separation between her stage identity and private life. Within hours, impersonators spun up Facebook accounts in her legal name and leak sites relabeled stolen clips, escalating harassment. Dahl told 404 Media she chose to include her legal name in the piece to try to reclaim control, but the episode underscores mounting concerns about Grok’s privacy and safety guardrails—especially around doxxing and sexualized content—and raises fresh questions about how chatbots source, filter, and gatekeep sensitive personal data.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**Public Data vs. Accessibility**
A significant portion of the debate centered on whether Grok actually "leaked" private information or simply surfaced data that was technically already public. Users did their own digging, noting that the information appeared to be available through decades-old social media posts archived on the Wayback Machine or via USPTO trademark filings. However, counter-arguments emphasized the concept of "security by obscurity." Commenters argued that there is a functional difference between data buried in a "faraway corner of the internet" that takes humans hours to find, and data served instantly by a chatbot. They contended that LLMs remove the friction that previously acted as a privacy shield, turning difficult-to-find information into immediate doxxing material.

**Data Scraping and "Grokipedia"**
Participants discussed "Grokipedia," an information retrieval component of xAI, noting that it lists sources directly. Some users expressed skepticism about the claim that the data was private to begin with, suggesting Grok likely crawled public web data or data broker aggregations. This led to a broader discussion on how LLMs are trained; several users pointed out that once an LLM ingests personal data from the internet archive, it is difficult to "scrub" or make the model forget it. Comparisons were made to Google and OpenAI, with users noting that established tech giants generally have legal processes for removing such data that xAI may lack.

**Harassment and Subject Identity**
The conversation touched on the specific vulnerability of the subject as a performer. While some comments were dismissive ("played the world's smallest violin"), others pushed back strongly, arguing that the dismissal of the harm was rooted in misogyny or bias against sex workers. These users highlighted that the technology powers abuse at scale, and that declaring data "public" forces victims into a binary where they cannot complain about harassment if a machine aggregates their data.

**Data Removal Services**
There was a side discussion regarding the efficacy of data removal services. Users questioned if paying these services actually works long-term, with some noting that while they can enforce removals, sketchier sites often ignore them or reappear, and LLM training sets present a new, harder-to-clean repository of personal history.

### Sam Altman (OpenAI) and Dario Amodei (Anthropic) Refuse to Hold Hands

#### [Submission URL](https://xcancel.com/ANI/status/2024349307835732347) | 57 points | by [doener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47074474)

Top story: Modi’s “hands up” photo op with AI chiefs goes viral at India AI Impact Summit 2026

- What happened: At the India AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, PM Narendra Modi posed with global AI leaders including Sundar Pichai (Google/Alphabet), Sam Altman (OpenAI), Dario Amodei (Anthropic), and Alexandr Wang (Scale AI). An ANI/DD News clip of a group hand-raise moment took off across X.
- The clip: Modi prompts a linked hand-raise; several executives look hesitant, with Altman and Amodei’s awkward half-gestures becoming the meme focus.
- Why it matters: Beyond the optics, the lineup underscores India’s bid to be a convening power in AI policy, investment, and infrastructure—positioning itself as more than a market and leaning into standard-setting and talent pipelines.

What people are saying
- Symbolism vs PR: Supporters hailed “collaboration” and India’s “civilizational confidence”; critics called it a political-style photo op overshadowing substance.
- Representation questions: Observers noted few Indian tech operators on stage besides Modi; others asked about notable absences (e.g., Meta’s AI leadership).
- Real-world friction: Delhiites complained about Bharat Mandapam logistics, with long walks and traffic disruptions during the event.

Notes and nitpicks
- The viral captioning sparked corrections about attendee titles/affiliations, adding to the meme storm.
- Rivals standing shoulder-to-shoulder (Altman/Amodei) drew jokes—and curiosity about how aligned the “AI Avengers” really are.

What to watch next
- Concrete outcomes: Any announcements on compute access, data center investments, skilling programs, or safety/standards workstreams tied to India.
- Policy influence: Whether India translates convening power into credible guardrails and incentives that attract frontier AI R&D—not just cloud and services.
- Industry impact: If India’s IT majors pivot toward AI productization fast enough to keep pace with the Anthropic/OpenAI era.

**The Awkward Photo Op**
Discussion turned immediately to the visible tension on stage, with the top comment comparing the scene to a satirical moment from Mike Judge’s *Silicon Valley*, imagining the PM forcing tech rivals into a “Thank You” tableau. Others joked that the tension between the executives felt like a remake of the movie *Challengers*.

**Bad Blood and Social Contracts**
A significant portion of the thread criticized the executives—specifically Sam Altman and Dario Amodei—for their reluctance to participate in the gesture.
*   **"Divorced Parents":** User `jobs_throwaway` labeled the display "shameful," comparing the CEOs to divorced parents who can’t pretend to get along for the sake of their children for ten seconds.
*   **Social Intelligence:** In a subhead regarding social norms, users argued that while such conventions (holding hands) are arbitrary, failing to follow them signals a lack of social adaptability. `malux85` noted that good judgment involves putting "petty rivalries" aside for the broader group, arguing that a photo op doesn't materially change the business competition between OpenAI and Anthropic, but refusing it makes them look immature.

**The "AI Avengers" History**
Commenters provided context for the friction, noting the specific history between the companies. `hnkly` pointed out that Anthropic was founded by disillusioned former OpenAI employees, comparing it to gaming industry schisms (like Runic Games spinning out of Blizzard).

**Tech Celebrity Status**
There was a brief debate regarding the longevity of these figures. While one user dismissed them as "ephemeral celebs," others pushed back strongly (one switching to Spanish to emphasize the point), arguing that dismissing the architects of the current AI boom as fleeting figures is a miscalculation of how the next decade will play out.

### What years of production-grade concurrency teaches us about building AI agents

#### [Submission URL](https://georgeguimaraes.com/your-agent-orchestrator-is-just-a-bad-clone-of-elixir/) | 115 points | by [ellieh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ellieh) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47067395)

Title: Your Agent Framework Is Just a Bad Clone of Elixir: Concurrency Lessons from Telecom to AI
Author: George Guimarães

Summary:
Guimarães argues that today’s Python/JS agent frameworks are reinventing Erlang/Elixir’s 40-year-old actor model—the same principles the BEAM VM was built on to run telecom switches. AI agents aren’t “web requests”; they’re long-lived, stateful, concurrent sessions that demand lightweight isolation, message passing, supervision, and fault tolerance. Those properties are native to the BEAM and only partially approximated by Node.js and Python frameworks. If you’re building AI agents at scale, Elixir isn’t a hipster pick; it’s the architecture the problem calls for.

Key points:
- The 30-second request problem: Agent sessions routinely hold open connections for 5–30s with multiple LLM calls, tools, and streaming—multiplied by 10,000+ users. Thread-per-request stacks struggle here.
- Why BEAM fits:
  - Millions of lightweight processes (~2 KB each), each with its own heap, GC, and fault isolation.
  - Preemptive scheduling (every ~4,000 reductions) prevents any single agent from hogging CPU.
  - Per-process garbage collection avoids global pauses at high concurrency.
  - Native distribution: processes talk across nodes transparently.
  - Phoenix Channels/LiveView already handle 100k+ WebSockets per server; an agent chat is just another long-lived connection.
- Node.js comparison:
  - Single-threaded event loop makes CPU-heavy work block unrelated sessions unless offloaded.
  - Stop-the-world GC and process-wide crashes hurt tail latency and reliability.
- Python/JS agent frameworks are converging on actors:
  - Langroid explicitly borrows the actor model.
  - LangGraph models agents as state machines with reducers and conditional edges.
  - CrewAI coordinates agents via shared memory and task passing.
  - AutoGen 0.4 pivots to an “event-driven actor framework” with async message passing and managed lifecycles.
  - Conclusion: they’re rediscovering what the BEAM has provided since 1986.
- LLMs + Elixir: José Valim highlighted a Tencent study where Claude Opus 4 achieved the highest code-completion rate on Elixir problems (80.3%), but the deeper point is runtime fit, not just codegen ergonomics.

Why it matters:
- Agentic workloads look like telecom, not classic web requests. Architectures tuned for short, stateless requests buckle under thousands of long-lived, stateful streams. BEAM’s actor model maps directly onto agent process-per-session designs with supervision and graceful failure.

Practical takeaways for builders:
- Model each agent/session as an independent BEAM process; use supervision trees for fault recovery.
- Stream tokens over Phoenix Channels; scale horizontally with native distribution.
- Keep heavy CPU/ML off the schedulers (use ports, separate services, or NIFs with dirty schedulers).
- Use per-process state for isolation; leverage ETS when shared, fast in-memory tables are needed.

Caveats:
- Python still dominates ML tooling; you’ll often pair Elixir orchestration with Python/Rust for heavy inference.
- NIFs can stall schedulers if misused; prefer ports or dirty schedulers for safety.
- Team familiarity and hosting/tooling may influence stack choice despite the runtime fit.

Bottom line:
AI agent frameworks in Python/JS are converging on the actor model because the problem demands it. If you want production-grade concurrency, fault isolation, and effortless real-time at scale, the BEAM/Elixir stack is the battle-tested blueprint rather than a pattern to reimplement piecemeal.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Runtime Fit vs. Real-World Bottlenecks**
A major thread of debate centered on whether BEAM’s concurrency advantages matter when AI workloads are heavily IO-bound. Users like **rndmtst** and **mccyb** argued that since agents spend 95% of their time waiting on external APIs (OpenAI/Anthropic), the scheduler's efficiency is less critical than it was for telecom switches. While they admitted hot code swapping is a genuine advantage for updating logic without dropping active sessions, they questioned if runtime benefits outweigh the massive ecosystem and hiring advantages of Python.

**"Let It Crash" vs. Context Preservation**
Commenters wrestled with applying Erlang’s "let it crash" philosophy to LLM context. **qdrpl** and **vns** pointed out that restarting a process effectively wipes the in-memory conversation history—a critical failure in AI sessions. **asa400** clarified that supervisors are intended for unknown/transient execution errors, not semantic logic failures; however, **mckrss** noted that BEAM’s fault tolerance doesn't solve "durable execution" (sustaining state across deployments or node restarts), often requiring hybrid architectures with standard databases anyway.

**Concurrency Constructs**
**znnjdl** shared an anecdote about switching from a complex Kubernetes setup to Elixir for long-running browser agents, noting that distributed problems that resulted in infrastructure "hell" elsewhere were solved by native language constructs. There was significant technical dispute between **wqtwt**, **kbwn**, and others regarding whether modern Linux OS threads are sufficient for these workloads versus the BEAM’s lightweight 2KB processes.

**Frameworks vs. Primitives**
The discussion compared building on Elixir primitives (OTP) versus Python frameworks. **vns** described tools like LangChain as "bloated" attempts to provide structure that Elixir offers natively, though **d4rkp4ttern** defended newer Python frameworks like Langroid. Finally, **jsvlm** (José Valim, creator of Elixir) chimed in to correct the historical record, noting that the creators of Erlang implemented the actor model independently to solve practical problems, rather than adopting it from academic theory.

### AI adoption and Solow's productivity paradox

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2026/02/17/ai-productivity-paradox-ceo-study-robert-solow-information-technology-age/) | 780 points | by [virgildotcodes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=virgildotcodes) | [734 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47055979)

Headline: CEOs say AI hasn’t moved the needle—economists dust off the Solow paradox

- A new NBER survey of ~6,000 executives across the U.S., U.K., Germany, and Australia finds nearly 90% report no AI impact on employment or productivity over the past three years. About two-thirds say they use AI—but only ~1.5 hours per week on average—and a quarter don’t use it at all.
- Despite the muted present, leaders still expect near-term gains: +1.4% productivity and +0.8% output over the next three years. Firms forecast a small employment drop (-0.7%), while workers expect a slight rise (+0.5%).
- The disconnect revives Solow’s productivity paradox: technology is everywhere except in the macro data. Apollo’s Torsten Slok says AI isn’t yet visible in employment, productivity, inflation, or most profit margins outside the “Magnificent Seven.”
- Evidence is mixed: the St. Louis Fed sees a 1.9% excess cumulative productivity bump since late 2022; an MIT study projects a more modest 0.5% over a decade. Separately, ManpowerGroup reports AI use up 13% in 2025 but confidence down 18%. IBM says it’s boosting junior hiring to avoid hollowing out its management pipeline.
- Optimists see a turn: Erik Brynjolfsson points to stronger GDP and estimates U.S. productivity rose 2.7% last year, suggesting benefits may finally follow 2024’s >$250B corporate AI spend.

Why it matters: Echoes of the 1980s IT cycle—big investment first, measurable gains later. Light-touch adoption and workflow inertia may be masking what only shows up after reorganization, tooling maturity, and broader diffusion.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The Solow Paradox & Historical Parallels**
Commenters engaged deeply with the article's comparison to the 1970s/80s productivity paradox. While some agree that we are in the "DOS era" of AI—where expensive investment precedes the "Windows 95" era of utility—others argue the comparison is flawed. One user notes a key economic difference: modern AI (e.g., a $20 Claude subscription) has a significantly lower barrier to entry and onboarding cost than the mainframe computing and manual office training required in the 1970s.

**The "Infinite Report" Loop**
A major thread of cynicism focuses on the nature of corporate work. Users argue that while AI might make producing reports "3x faster," it often degrades the signal-to-noise ratio.
*   **The Fluff Tax:** Critics point out that faster writing shifts the burden to the reader; if a report takes 10% longer to understand because of AI "fluff," overall organizational value is lost.
*   **The AI Ouroboros:** Several users joked (or lamented) that the inevitable solution is people using AI to summarize the very reports that colleagues used AI to generate, resulting in a hollow loop of information transfer.

**Skill Acquisition vs. "Licking the Window"**
There is significant skepticism regarding using LLMs for learning and skill development.
*   **False Confidence:** Users warn that AI gives a "false sense of security" regarding understanding material. One commenter vividly described it as "looking through the window" at knowledge rather than grasping it, advocating for the traditional "RTFM" (Read The F*ing Manual) approach for true expertise.
*   **Code vs. Prose:** While confidence in AI for general communication is low, some developers defend the utility of current models for coding, noting that recent improvements in context handling allow models to effectively read codebases and implement solutions, unlike the "hallucinations" common in semantic text tasks.

**Technical Bottlenecks**
The discussion touched on the limits of current distinct architectures. Some predict that purely scaling context windows (RAG) yields diminishing returns or slows down processing. One prediction suggests that the real productivity breakthrough won't come from larger LLMs, but from hybrid models that pair LLMs with logic-based systems to eliminate hallucinations and perform actual reasoning rather than probabilistic token generation.

### Microsoft says bug causes Copilot to summarize confidential emails

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/microsoft/microsoft-says-bug-causes-copilot-to-summarize-confidential-emails/) | 261 points | by [tablets](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tablets) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47060202)

Microsoft says a bug in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat has been summarizing emails marked confidential, effectively bypassing data loss prevention policies. Tracked as CW1226324 and first detected January 21, the issue hit the Copilot “work tab” chat, which pulled content from users’ Sent Items and Drafts in Outlook desktop—even when sensitivity labels should have blocked automated access. Microsoft attributes it to a code/configuration error and began rolling out a fix in early February; a worldwide configuration update for enterprise customers is now deployed, and the company is monitoring and validating with affected users. Microsoft stresses no one gained access to information they weren’t already authorized to see, but admits the behavior violated Copilot’s design to exclude protected content. The company hasn’t disclosed the scope or a final remediation timeline; the incident is flagged as an advisory, suggesting limited impact. Why it matters: it’s a trust hit for AI guardrails in enterprise email—showing how label- and DLP-based protections can be undermined by new AI features even without a classic data breach.

Based on the discussion, commenters focused on the fundamental conflict between rapid AI integration and enterprise security requirements. Several users criticized Microsoft's approach as "sprinkling AI" onto existing tech stacks without rethinking the underlying security architecture, noting that standard protections (like prompt injection defenses) are insufficient against "unknown unknowns." A self-identified AI researcher argued that engineering is currently outpacing theoretical understanding, leading to "minimum viable product" safeguards that cannot guarantee data safety or effectively "unlearn" information once processed.

Key themes in the thread included:

*   **Failure of Guardrails:** Participants noted that Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools are pointless if the AI layer can bypass them, effectively rendering manual classification (like employee NDAs or "Confidential" labels) moot.
*   **The OS Debate:** The incident sparked a recurring debate about leaving the Microsoft ecosystem for Linux or macOS due to "user-hostile" feature bloat, though counter-arguments pointed out that switching operating systems does not mitigate cloud-service vulnerabilities.
*   **Terminology:** There was significant skepticism regarding Microsoft’s classification of the bug as an "advisory." Users argued this term softens the reality of what they view as a significant breach of trust and privacy, distinguishing it from the typical, lower-severity definition of the word in IT contexts.

### Fastest Front End Tooling for Humans and AI

#### [Submission URL](https://cpojer.net/posts/fastest-frontend-tooling) | 109 points | by [cpojer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cpojer) | [94 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47060052)

Fastest Frontend Tooling for Humans and AI: a push for 10x faster JS/TS feedback loops

The author argues 2026 is the year JavaScript tooling finally gets fast by pairing strict defaults with native-speed tools—benefiting both humans and LLMs. The centerpiece is tsgo, a Go rewrite of TypeScript that reportedly delivers ~10x faster type checking, editor support, and even catches some errors the JS implementation missed. It’s been used across 20+ projects (1k–1M LOC) and is pitched as stable enough to adopt, especially if you first swap builds to tsdown (Rolldown-based) for libraries or Vite for apps. Migration is simple: install @typescript/native-preview, replace tsc with tsgo, clean legacy flags, and flip a VS Code setting.

On formatting, Oxfmt aims to replace Prettier without losing ecosystem coverage. It bakes in popular plugins (import/Tailwind class sorting) and falls back to Prettier for the long tail of non-JS languages, easing migration and editor integration.

For linting, Oxlint is positioned as the first credible ESLint replacement because it can run ESLint plugins via a shim and NAPI-RS, supports TS config files, and adds type-aware rules. With oxlint --type-aware --type-check, you can lint and type-check in one fast pass powered by tsgo.

To make strictness easy, @nkzw/oxlint-config bundles a comprehensive, fast, and opinionated rule set designed to guide both developers and LLMs:
- Error-only (no warnings)
- Enforce modern, consistent style
- Ban bug-prone patterns (e.g., instanceof), disallow debug-only code in prod
- Prefer fast, autofixable rules; avoid slow or overly subjective ones

The post includes “migration prompts” for swapping Prettier→Oxfmt and ESLint→Oxlint, and points to ready-made templates (web, mobile, library, server) used by OpenClaw. Smaller DevX picks name-check npm-run-all2, ts-node, pnpm, Vite, and React.

Why it matters: Faster, stricter tooling shortens feedback loops, reduces bugs, and—per the author’s experiments—helps LLMs produce more correct code under strong guardrails. Caveat: tsgo is still labeled experimental, so teams should trial it on a branch before a full switch.

Based on the discussion, the community reaction is divided between excitement for performance gains and concern over the long-term maintainability of a "fractured" ecosystem.

**The "Schism" and Maintainability**
The most contentious point, led by user **conartist6**, is the fear that rewriting JavaScript tooling in low-level languages (Rust, Go) creates a "big schism." Critics argue this prevents the average JS developer from understanding, debugging, or contributing to the tools they rely on, potentially leaving critical infrastructure in the hands of VC-backed entities (like the creators of VoidZero) rather than the community. **TheAlexLichter** counters this, arguing that the average web developer rarely contributes to tooling internals anyway, and that AI tools make crossing language barriers (JS to Rust) easier for those who do wish to contribute.

**Performance vs. Architecture**
There is a debate regarding *why* current tooling is slow.
*   **The Unified JS Argument:** Some users argue that the slowness isn't due to JavaScript itself, but rather the inefficiency of running three separate programs (bundler, linter, formatter) that all parse the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) separately. They suggest a unified toolchain written in JS would be sufficient if architected correctly.
*   **The Native Speed Argument:** Others, including **9dev**, argue that JS runtimes have hit a performance wall ("throughput cliff"), making native languages necessary for modern build speeds. They contend that "batch processing" speed is relevant and not just an architectural issue.

**Adoption and Compatibility**
Users like **dcr** express high interest in switching for the "10x speed increase," noting that if the tools are compatible (e.g., Oxfmt supporting Prettier plugins, Oxlint running ESLint rules via compatibility layers), the migration is worth it. **TheAlexLichter** confirms that tools like Oxlint and independent projects like Rolldown are designed to be compatible replacements for existing standards.

**Other points raised:**
*   **Bun:** User **fsmdbrg** questions why **Bun** wasn't mentioned, noting it already offers a fast, unified runtime, bundler, and test runner that solves many of these problems.
*   **AI Skepticism:** One user initially dismissed the post as "AI spam" due to its tone, highlighting a growing distrust in the community toward AI-generated technical content, though they later walked back the comment.
*   **Security:** There were minor concerns regarding tracking CVEs in the native dependencies of these new tools, though others felt the risk was manageable compared to general supply chain risks.

### The Future of AI Software Development

#### [Submission URL](https://martinfowler.com/fragments/2026-02-18.html) | 199 points | by [nthypes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nthypes) | [140 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47062534)

Martin Fowler recaps Thoughtworks’ Future of Software Development Retreat, pushing back on calls for an “AI-era manifesto.” Instead, a 17-page summary distills eight themes showing how practices built for human-only development are buckling under AI-assisted work. Replacements are emerging but immature.

What’s new
- Supervisory engineering “middle loop”: a layer between prompt/coding and production that focuses on oversight, verification, and integration.
- Risk tiering as a core discipline: engineering practices and controls scale with the risk of the change/system.
- TDD reframed as prompt engineering: tests as the most reliable way to specify and constrain LLM behavior.
- From DevEx to AgentEx: invest in tooling and workflows for humans plus agents, not just humans.

Reality check
- AI is an accelerator/amplifier, not a panacea. It speeds coding, but if delivery practices are weak, it just accelerates tech debt (echoing the 2025 DORA report).
- No one has it figured out at scale; the most valuable outcome may be a shared set of questions.

Open questions
- Skill mix: will LLMs erode FE/BE specialization in favor of “expert generalists,” or just code around silos?
- Economics: what happens when token subsidies end?
- Process: do richer specs push teams toward waterfall, or can LLMs speed evolutionary delivery without losing feedback loops?

Security and platforms
- Security lagged in attendance, but consensus: platform teams must provide “bullet trains” — fast, safe AI paths with security baked in. Vendors may be underweighting safety factors.

Meta
- Open Space format fostered deep, respectful dialogue and notable inclusivity — a reminder culture still compounds tooling.

Here is the daily digest summary for the top story:

### **Martin Fowler on AI’s impact: no new manifesto, but big shifts underway**

Martin Fowler provides a recap of the Thoughtworks Future of Software Development Retreat, arguing against the creation of a new "AI manifesto" and instead presenting a summary of how AI is buckling practices originally designed solely for humans. The report identifies eight key themes, suggesting that while AI serves as an accelerator, it also threatens to speed up the accumulation of technical debt if delivery practices are weak.

**Key emerging concepts include:**
*   **Supervisory Engineering:** A "middle loop" focused on oversight and verification rather than direct coding.
*   **Risk Tiering:** Scaling engineering controls based on the risk level of the change.
*   **TDD as Prompt Engineering:** Using tests as the primary method to specify and constrain LLM behavior.
*   **AgentEx:** Moving beyond Developer Experience to build tooling for both humans and agents.

The report concludes that no one has solved this at scale yet, and the industry currently has more shared questions—about economics, skill specialization, and security—than answers.

***

### **Discussion Summary**

The discussion on Hacker News pivots from Thoughtworks' high-level theory to the practical realities of model costs, hardware, and the changing nature of code quality.

**The Rise of Efficient Models (Kimi k2.5 vs. Claude)**
A significant portion of the thread focuses on the emergence of **Kimi k2.5** (often accessed via Fireworks AI or OpenCode) as a "daily driver" for coding. Users report switching away from Anthropic’s Claude (Sonnet/Opus) due to cost and "sporadic" refusal issues. Several commenters describe Kimi as offering a superior price-to-performance ratio, with one user noting it solved a problem in 60 seconds that Claude failed to address, all for a fraction of the monthly subscription cost.

**Local Hardware vs. API Economics**
There is an active debate regarding the economics of running models locally versus using APIs:
*   **Hardware:** Enthusiasts are discussing the viability of running near-SOTA models (like Qwen 2.5 Coder or Minimax M25) on consumer hardware. Specific mentions include the **AMD Ryzen Strix Halo** (approx. $2,500 build) capable of decent token speeds, versus high-end Mac Studios ($20k).
*   **Commoditization:** Users speculate that token costs are trending toward zero. Given how cheap inference is becoming, some argue it makes less sense to invest heavily in local hardware for pure coding utility, reserving local builds for privacy or hobbyist experimentation.

**Philosophy: The Death of "Clean Code"?**
A deep sub-thread challenges the necessity of "production quality" code in an AI-native world.
*   **"Garbage" Grade Code:** Users admit that while LLM output can be "garbage grade" (messy, unoptimized), it is often "flawless" in utility—solving immediate problems or building side projects that simply work.
*   **Pattern Obsolescence:** Commenters argue that design patterns and "clean code" principles exist primarily to lower cognitive load for *human* maintainers. If AI agents eventually take over maintenance and modification, the need for human-readable architecture may diminish, shifting the requirement from "maintainable" software to simply "scalable and robust" software.
