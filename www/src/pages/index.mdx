### Claude Code can debug low-level cryptography

#### [Submission URL](https://words.filippo.io/claude-debugging/) | 394 points | by [Bogdanp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bogdanp) | [184 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45784179)

A Go engineer livecoded a fresh implementation of ML-DSA (a NIST-selected post-quantum signature scheme) for the Go standard library, only to find verify always rejected valid signatures. Exhausted, they pointed Claude Code (v2.0.28, Opus 4.1, “ultrathink”) at the repo and tests. It immediately pinpointed a subtle bug: the verify path was effectively taking the high bits of w1 twice. The author had merged HighBits and w1Encode for signing, then reused it in verify where UseHint already supplies high bits. Claude wrote a confirming test and a working (but mediocre) patch; the author refactored properly to pass high bits explicitly and even improved performance by avoiding an extra Montgomery round-trip.

They ran a second experiment on earlier failing signing code:
- Bug 1: Miscomputed Montgomery constants for 1 and −1 caused the Fiat–Shamir-with-aborts loop to never terminate. Claude replicated the printf sleuthing and fixed it faster than the author.
- Bug 2: A signature field was encoded as 32 bits instead of 32 bytes. Claude took longer, wandered a bit, then found it in a fresh session. Its suggested fix tweaked length but not capacity; the author refined it.

Takeaways:
- AI excels at well-scoped, testable failures in low-level code and can rapidly localize non-obvious defects.
- It may stop after the first fix; fresh sessions help isolate independent bugs.
- Great for hypotheses and scaffolding; humans still polish APIs and correctness.
- Disclosure: author had complimentary Claude Max access from Anthropic; no request to publish.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores mixed reactions to using AI (specifically Claude Code) for debugging complex, low-level crypto code, highlighting both potential and limitations:

1. **AI Debugging Effectiveness**  
   - Users note AI excels at *localizing narrow, testable bugs* (e.g., bitwise errors, encoding oversights) but struggles with broader system issues (concurrency, architectural flaws). Restarting AI sessions helps isolate independent bugs.
   - Skepticism exists about relying on AI for *deeper reasoning*: comments suggest AI may generate "plausible but wrong" fixes, requiring human refinement for correctness and maintainability.

2. **Comparison to Junior Engineers**  
   - Some analogize AI tools to *junior developers*: they accelerate grunt work (tedious bug-hunting, scaffolding) but lack critical judgment. A user warns this risks creating "busywork" reviews for seniors if unchecked.

3. **Limitations & Over-Reliance**  
   - AI’s utility depends on *precise prompting* and domain context (e.g., referencing cryptographic primitives like Montgomery constants). Vague prompts yield unhelpful outputs.  
   - Concerns arise about *eroding foundational skills*: one thread debates whether AI reliance parallels overusing calculators in math education, potentially stunting low-level understanding.

4. **Practical Workflow Integration**  
   - Users report success integrating AI for *hypothesis generation* (e.g., "printf-style sleuthing") but stress the need for rigorous testing. AI-authored code often requires refactoring for performance/readability.  
   - Mixed experiences: some find AI reduces tedium; others call it "time-wasting" when debugging ill-defined issues.

5. **Skepticism vs. Optimism**  
   - Critics dismiss hype, calling overly positive claims "forbidden phrases [from] experts." Others cautiously endorse AI as a *complementary tool*, not a replacement for expertise.  
   - A recurring theme: AI’s value hinges on the user’s ability to *guide and validate* its output, balancing speed with meticulous review.  

**Key Takeaway**  
While AI like Claude Code accelerates debugging in niche scenarios (cryptographic bit-twiddling, testable edge cases), its effectiveness is bounded by the user’s expertise to frame problems and vet solutions. The consensus leans toward cautious adoption—valuable for specific, narrow tasks but insufficient for holistic engineering.

### Show HN: Why write code if the LLM can just do the thing? (web app experiment)

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/samrolken/nokode) | 386 points | by [samrolken](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samrolken) | [277 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45783640)

What it is
- An experiment to skip code generation entirely: every HTTP request is handled by an LLM that decides what to do.
- Tools exposed to the model: database (SQLite queries; model designs schema), webResponse (returns HTML/JSON), updateMemory (persists user feedback to markdown for the next request).

How it works
- The server sends “Handle this HTTP request: {METHOD} {PATH}” and the model chooses SQL, HTML/JS, or JSON to produce.
- It infers UI vs API from the path (/contacts → HTML page; /api/contacts → JSON).
- Each page includes a feedback box; user notes like “make buttons bigger” or “use dark theme” get implemented in subsequent responses.

Results
- It works: forms submit, data persists, APIs return valid JSON, reasonable schemas and parameterized SQL, REST-ish routes, responsive layouts, validation, error handling—without hardcoded app logic.
- Pain points are all performance/ops:
  - Latency: 30–60s per request (≈300–6000x slower than a normal app).
  - Cost: ~$0.01–$0.05 per request (≈100–1000x more expensive).
  - Consistency: design drifts between requests; short memory despite feedback file.
  - Reliability: occasional hallucinated SQL → 500s; 75–85% of time spent “reasoning.”

Why it matters
- Demonstrates that LLMs can execute application logic today; the blockers are speed, cost, consistency, and reliability—not raw capability.
- Points toward a future where “intent → execution” could displace much of traditional app code if inference becomes fast, cheap, and stateful.

Try it
- Node app using Claude 3 Haiku; configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and run npm start. Defaults to a contact manager; try routes like /game, /dashboard, /api/stats.
- Budget for per-request inference costs.

The discussion explores the debate around deterministic versus non-deterministic behavior in AI systems, using self-driving cars and LLM-driven applications as key examples:

1. **Determinism Tradeoffs**  
   - Proponents argue deterministic systems (like traditional code) offer reliability and predictability, while critics note LLMs' non-deterministic nature better handles complex/unpredictable real-world scenarios.  
   - Comparisons drawn to human behavior: "Average humans solve complex problems through non-deterministic trial-and-error" vs machines requiring explicit instructions.

2. **Real-World Challenges**  
   - Self-driving car analogy: Even deterministic physics simulations can't prevent accidents if intent interpretation fails. LLMs struggle with reliably translating natural language instructions into consistent actions.  
   - UX concerns: Non-determinism causes frustration when systems like Google Assistant unpredictably fail basic queries, despite potential benefits for complex tasks.

3. **Technical Limitations**  
   - Current LLMs spend 75-85% of time "reasoning," leading to latency and hallucinations (e.g., malformed SQL queries crashing servers).  
   - Core tension: Language inherently ambiguous vs machines needing precise instructions. One user notes "The primary difficulty is articulating intent, not implementing it."

4. **Philosophical Divergence**  
   - Transportation metaphors highlight societal preferences: Some value schedule reliability (deterministic), others prioritize flexibility.  
   - Deeper existential questions emerge about whether AI systems replicating human-like chemical reward mechanisms (dopamine triggers) constitute meaningful progress.

The discussion ultimately frames non-determinism as both a technical hurdle and philosophical frontier, with participants divided on whether unpredictability represents a bug (to be minimized) or feature (enabling adaptability).

### Word2vec-style vector arithmetic on docs embeddings

#### [Submission URL](https://technicalwriting.dev/embeddings/arithmetic/index.html) | 70 points | by [kaycebasques](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kaycebasques) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45784455)

- The author tests whether the classic “king − man + woman ≈ queen” trick works on modern document-level embeddings. They embed full docs and single words with EmbeddingGemma, then do vector math like: vector(“Testing Your Database” from Supabase) − vector(“supabase”) + vector(“angular”).
- Verification is indirect: they compare the resulting vectors against embeddings of a small set of short docs (Angular, Supabase, Playwright, Skylib, CockroachDB) using cosine similarity.
- Key finding: task type settings matter a lot. With custom task types, the “same topic, different domain” experiment lands on Angular testing docs as hoped:
  - “Testing” (Angular): 0.751
  - “Testing Services” (Angular): 0.629
  With default task types, the result stays closest to the original Supabase doc (0.659) instead of transferring to Angular.
- The author also runs a “different topic, same domain” variant (subtract “testing”, add “vectors”) aiming to hit Supabase’s “Vector Columns,” and notes prior research that task types noticeably affect outcomes.
- Caveats: 2048-token limit (no chunking), small candidate set, mostly testing-related docs, and cosine similarity as a proxy for “semantic correctness.”
- Takeaway: word2vec-style vector offsets can work at document scale with modern models, but only reliably when the embedding task type is tuned; defaults may cling to the source document’s domain. Source code is provided.

The discussion explores the implications and challenges of applying word2vec-style vector arithmetic to modern document embeddings, with several key themes:

1. **Model Comparisons & Technical Insights**  
   - Users note that doc2vec (Paragraph Vectors) produces coarser document similarities compared to transformer-based embeddings, heavily dependent on training data and application. The 2015 Paragraph Vector paper is cited as foundational but limited.  
   - Tests of the "king − man + woman ≈ queen" analogy across models reveal stark differences: OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-large` scored poorly (0.54), while EmbeddingGemma (0.84) and Qwen3-Embedding4B (0.71) performed better. Skepticism arises around OpenAI’s SOTA claims.  

2. **Evaluation Critiques**  
   - Debates emerge about metrics: Absolute L2 distances and cosine similarity may be misleading in high-dimensional spaces. Relative differences and normalization (e.g., spherical embeddings) are suggested as more meaningful for analogy tasks.  

3. **Practical Applications**  
   - Ideas for technical writing workflows include using embeddings to surface relevant documentation, track completeness via spreadsheets, or integrate CLI tools with LLMs (e.g., Claude) for cross-referencing. Structured, deterministic workflows are emphasized over "messy" docs.  

4. **Stylistic Control & Alignment**  
   - Users discuss leveraging vector arithmetic for controllable writing tools (e.g., style transfer via "person vectors" from Anthropic’s research) or aligning model outputs by manipulating embeddings.  

5. **Skepticism & Limitations**  
   - Concerns persist about modern models’ ability to reliably handle analogies compared to classic word2vec, with domain specificity and task-type tuning (as in the submission) deemed critical. A linked 2019 study underscores lingering challenges in vector arithmetic generalization.  

Overall, the discussion highlights cautious optimism about document-level vector operations but stresses the need for nuanced evaluation and domain-specific tuning.

### You can't refuse to be scanned by ICE's facial recognition app, DHS document say

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/you-cant-refuse-to-be-scanned-by-ices-facial-recognition-app-dhs-document-says/) | 546 points | by [nh43215rgb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nh43215rgb) | [428 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45780228)

You Can't Refuse ICE’s Face Scan, DHS Doc Says

- What happened: An internal DHS document obtained via FOIA shows ICE’s field agents are using a facial recognition app, “Mobile Fortify,” to verify identity and immigration status—and people aren’t allowed to decline a scan.
- Data retention: Photos captured by the app are stored for 15 years, regardless of immigration or citizenship status. That includes U.S. citizens.
- Scope: The doc sheds light on the tech, data flow, storage, and DHS’s rationale. It follows 404 Media’s earlier reporting that ICE and CBP are scanning faces on the street to check citizenship.
- Why it matters: This pushes facial recognition from airports and ports into everyday encounters, eliminating consent and expanding long-term biometric databases. It raises questions about accuracy, bias, due process, and how such scans fit under Fourth Amendment protections during stops.

What to watch
- Legal challenges over warrantless, nonconsensual biometric collection in public stops
- Whether DHS creates a deletion or redress process for citizens and lawful residents
- Oversight on data sharing across DHS components and other agencies
- Transparency on error rates, audit trails, and how scans trigger further action

Source: 404 Media (FOIA-driven report; free to read)

### Summary of the Discussion:

1. **Criticism of ICE's Facial Recognition Use**:  
   Users express alarm over ICE’s "Mobile Fortify" app, which mandates facial scans without consent, stores data for 15 years, and lacks transparency. Comparisons are drawn to authoritarian surveillance regimes, with concerns about justifying systemic rights violations.

2. **Debate Over Human vs. AI Verification**:  
   - Skeptics argue facial recognition is error-prone and biased, citing real-world failures (e.g., false arrests) and challenges with diverse lighting/shadow conditions. Links to studies highlight racial bias and inaccuracy.  
   - Proponents counter that human processes (e.g., ID checks) are also flawed, pointing to NIST studies showing AI can outperform humans in controlled settings. However, critics stress the lack of transparency in error rates and auditing.

3. **Technical and Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Discussions mention risks of long-term biometric databases, misuse of data across agencies, and the lack of redress for false matches.  
   - Alternative identity methods (DNA, social recovery) are suggested but deemed impractical due to false positives (e.g., identical twins) and privacy trade-offs.

4. **Distrust in Institutions**:  
   Users critique agencies like TSA for relying on ineffective tech (e.g., "bomb detectors"), fueling skepticism about ICE’s deployment of facial recognition. Others warn against conflating AI accuracy with ethical implementation.

5. **Political and Legal Implications**:  
   Concerns about suppression of criticism (e.g., labeling dissenters as “enemies”) and parallels to dystopian policies. Questions arise about Fourth Amendment violations and the need for legal challenges to nonconsensual scans.

6. **Meta-Discussion on HN Culture**:  
   Side debates erupt about HN’s shift toward political content, moderation practices (shadowbanning, flagging), and the reliability of AI-generated summaries vs. primary sources.

**Key Themes**:  
- **Accuracy & Bias**: Uncertainty about AI’s reliability vs. human oversight.  
- **Privacy & Due Process**: Fear of irreversible surveillance infrastructure.  
- **Institutional Trust**: Skepticism toward government tech adoption without accountability.  
- **Ethical Tech Debate**: Tension between innovation and civil liberties.

### New analog chip capable of outperforming top-end GPUs by as much as 1000x

#### [Submission URL](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/china-solves-century-old-problem-with-new-analog-chip-that-is-1-000-times-faster-than-high-end-nvidia-gpus) | 62 points | by [mrbluecoat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mrbluecoat) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45779181)

HN Summary: China’s analog AI/6G chip claims 1,000× GPU throughput, 100× energy efficiency

TL;DR
- Peking University researchers built an analog “compute‑in‑memory” chip using RRAM that processes data as electrical currents instead of digital 1s/0s.
- In Nature Electronics (Oct 13), they report digital‑like accuracy on hard communications tasks (e.g., MIMO matrix inversion), while using ~100× less energy.
- With additional tuning, they claim up to 1,000× higher throughput than Nvidia’s H100 and AMD’s Vega 20 on those workloads.

Why it matters
- Analog, in‑memory computing slashes the cost of moving data between memory and compute—today’s biggest bottleneck for AI and advanced wireless.
- If the results hold, this could be a big deal for 6G base stations, edge inference, and low‑power linear‑algebra accelerators.

How it works
- Arrays of RRAM cells both store weights and perform operations; computations happen as continuous currents across the array.
- This architecture is well‑suited to matrix‑vector ops central to signal processing (e.g., massive MIMO) and certain AI inference kernels.

Reality check
- “Up to 1,000×” appears limited to specific linear‑algebra problems under controlled precision; it’s not a general GPU replacement.
- Analog chips face hard problems: device variability, noise/drift, temperature sensitivity, RRAM endurance, and ADC/DAC overhead that can erase gains.
- Programmability, software stacks, and scaling to large, dynamic AI workloads remain open questions.
- Vega 20 is an older GPU; H100 is modern—benchmark details matter. Paper‑level prototypes often trail real‑world deployability.

Big picture
- It’s another strong signal that specialized, domain‑specific hardware (especially compute‑in‑memory) may outpace general GPUs on narrow but important tasks, particularly in comms and edge AI. The leap from lab to production—and to broader AI use cases—will be the real test.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism and historical context regarding analog AI chips, emphasizing challenges in deployment and scalability despite their potential efficiency gains. Key points include:

1. **Historical Precedents & Challenges:**
   - Analog computing concepts trace back to Frank Rosenblatt's Perceptron (1950s) and Carver Mead's work in the 1980s. Companies like Synaptics and Mythic AI attempted analog chips but faced commercialization hurdles (e.g., Mythic’s bankruptcy in 2022).
   - Early analog neural networks (e.g., Mead’s *Analog VLSI Neural Systems*) showed promise for low-power applications but struggled with scalability and integration into hybrid systems due to DAC/ADC overhead.

2. **Real-World Applications & Limitations:**
   - Niche successes exist, like Microsoft’s 1999 optical mouse (using Avago’s analog sensor for motion correlation), but these are specialized and not scalable to broader AI/compute tasks.
   - Analog’s advantages (e.g., power efficiency) are countered by device variability, noise, temperature sensitivity, and manufacturing challenges, making digital dominance persist.

3. **Technical Skepticism:**
   - The chip’s claimed 1,000× throughput gains are seen as context-specific (e.g., matrix inversion for MIMO systems), not general-purpose. Scalability beyond small matrices (e.g., 16x16) and software ecosystem gaps remain concerns.
   - Comments highlight that analog’s theoretical efficiency often erodes in practice due to ADC/DAC costs, precision trade-offs, and reliability issues.

4. **Niche Potential vs. Hype:**
   - While analog could excel in edge AI or signal processing, users doubt it will replace GPUs for mainstream AI. Some humorously note that benchmarks against older GPUs (Vega 20) and software bottlenecks (e.g., Windows compatibility) undercut claims.

5. **Cultural References & Humor:**
   - Lighthearted remarks compare the chip’s hype to running *Crysis* or retro games on modern systems, mocking overpromises. Others reference music (*Analog Man* by Joe Walsh) and memes (“Fear” as a motivator).

**Conclusion:** The discussion acknowledges analog’s potential in specialized domains but stresses that overcoming technical barriers, ecosystem development, and real-world validation are critical hurdles. Historical lessons and skepticism temper excitement, emphasizing that lab prototypes rarely translate seamlessly to production.

### Czech police forced to turn off facial recognition cameras at the Prague airport

#### [Submission URL](https://edri.org/our-work/czech-police-forced-to-turn-off-facial-recognition-cameras-at-the-prague-airport-thanks-to-the-ai-act/) | 148 points | by [campuscodi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=campuscodi) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45784185)

Czech police shut down Prague airport facial recognition after AI Act; watchdog finds it illegal

- Prague’s Václav Havel Airport ran a real-time facial recognition system from 2018 until August 2025, matching travelers’ facial “bio-indexes” against watchlists of wanted or missing people.
- After years of pressure from civil society group IuRe, the Czech Data Protection Authority (DPA) confirmed the setup violated personal data laws. The EU AI Act’s biometric rules, in force since February 2025, require judicial approval per use—none was obtained—rendering operations between Feb–Aug 2025 unlawful.
- Despite repeated warnings and media scrutiny, police kept the system running until the August shutdown. IuRe obtained the DPA’s findings via a Freedom of Information request.
- The DPA’s inspection took nearly four years, highlighting enforcement lag and the need for clear, democratically vetted rules for police use of biometric tech.
- Separately, police continue using the Digital Personal Image Information System, a database of about 20 million ID/passport photos for retrospective face matching. Authorities say it helps identify the deceased, but IuRe and the DPA warn it could also be used to identify protesters.
- IuRe urges the new Interior Minister to overhaul laws to align with EU safeguards; the group continues monitoring via its “Czechia is not China” campaign.

Why it matters: The case shows the AI Act starting to bite—but also how slow oversight can be. It spotlights the risk of repurposing massive ID photo databases for surveillance and the need for tight, court-supervised limits on biometric policing in the EU.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the ethical and practical implications of facial recognition systems, particularly in light of the Czech airport case and the EU AI Act. Key themes include:

1. **Trust in Institutions:**  
   Users debate distrust in both governments and corporations handling biometric data. Concerns are raised about mass surveillance enabling targeted enforcement, propaganda, and corporate exploitation. Microsoft and other tech firms are critiqued for lobbying weak privacy standards. Some argue that systems built by private entities (not governments) lack accountability, with enforcement of privacy laws often symbolic.

2. **Privacy vs. Security Trade-offs:**  
   Supporters of facial recognition argue it can enhance security if used responsibly (e.g., identifying criminals), while critics highlight risks like mission creep (e.g., tracking protesters). Automation in airport checkpoints is seen as both efficient and privacy-invasive, with debates over whether security justifies pervasive monitoring.

3. **Historical & Regional Context:**  
   Commentators note former Warsaw Pact countries’ histories of state surveillance, while others compare modern systems to the NSA’s XKeyscore. Anecdotes about lax EU airport security (e.g., unchecked IDs in the 80s/90s) contrast with current biometric checks, though skepticism remains about their effectiveness (e.g., a pilot allowing unauthorized boarding).

4. **Regulatory Challenges:**  
   The EU AI Act is praised for requiring judicial oversight but criticized for slow enforcement. Users stress the need for clear, democratically-vetted rules to prevent misuse of databases like the Czech ID photo repository. Meta-discussions question whether HN overemphasizes privacy battles while ignoring corporate data harvesting (e.g., Google, credit cards).

5. **Community Split:**  
   The thread reflects a roughly 50/50 divide: half view facial recognition as a necessary tool against crime, while half see it as a slippery slope toward authoritarianism. Some urge focusing on corporate data control rather than government overreach.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion underscores deep skepticism about biometric surveillance, emphasizing the need for transparency, judicial safeguards, and public accountability. While pragmatic security benefits are acknowledged, fears of abuse by both states and corporations dominate, with calls for stricter EU-wide regulations and ethical tech deployment.

### AI Broke Interviews

#### [Submission URL](https://yusufaytas.com/ai-broke-interviews/) | 77 points | by [yusufaytas](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yusufaytas) | [104 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45785794)

AI Broke Interviews: the old “LeetCode + system design + behavioral” pipeline was flawed but stable because it compressed signal into 45 minutes. Generative AI blew up the core assumption behind it: that the candidate is the one doing the thinking.

What’s new
- Effortless perfection: candidates deliver polished code and scripted behavioral answers with no visible reasoning. Nudge the problem off-script and some collapse.
- Cheating scales: no need for friends or prep; a phone or overlay can stream “perfect” code and talking points. The author cites multiple CVs tied to the same email, verbatim reading of AI answers, and candidates tripping over AI-inserted syntax.
- Panic responses: companies are tightening identity checks, adding proctoring, and shifting back to in‑person. The post claims Google announced a return to in‑person due to AI misuse.

Why it matters
- The legacy interview was bad, but it worked “well enough” because it filtered on preparation under time pressure. AI erased that filtration layer, making it hard to separate genuine reasoning from AI proxying.
- Measuring “can you solve this now?” no longer maps to “can you think?” when perfect solutions are commodities.

What companies are trying
- Hardening the format: in‑person rounds, no‑internet segments, paper/whiteboard thinking, live code walkthroughs, and off‑script variations to force real-time reasoning.
- Shifting the tasks: debug unfamiliar, messy code; read and critique diffs; write tests; reason about logs and flaky failures; small iterative builds where you must explain trade‑offs as you go.
- Artifact‑based behavioral: ask for concrete stories with PRs, design docs, or incident write‑ups; “teach back” a concept; explain why a change is safe.
- Process changes: paid work trials, stronger references, structured rubrics, portfolio review. Some teams experiment with “AI‑allowed” sections that grade how you prompt, verify, test, and critique model output.

Tensions and risks
- Arms race fatigue: proctoring and AI‑detection are brittle and create false positives.
- Fairness: in‑person favors locals; take‑homes and trials can be exclusionary or legally fraught if not paid and scoped.
- Philosophy split: ban AI to isolate raw reasoning vs embrace AI and evaluate judgment with the tool. The post argues interviews should measure problem‑solving, not prompting—but acknowledges the industry hasn’t cleanly separated the two yet.

The takeaway
AI didn’t just make interviews harder; it invalidated their core signal. The next wave will emphasize observable thinking: debugging, code reading, trade‑off narration, tests and verification, and learning speed—sometimes with AI explicitly in-bounds, sometimes with it off. Until then, expect more in‑person loops, stricter identity checks, and interview designs that reward how you reason, not how perfectly you recite.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's disruption of technical interviews revolves around several key themes:

1. **AI's Impact on Traditional Interviews**:  
   - AI tools allow candidates to generate polished code and scripted answers, undermining the traditional "LeetCode + system design" pipeline. This erodes trust in coding assessments, as candidates may rely on AI instead of demonstrating genuine problem-solving skills.  
   - Companies like Google and Microsoft are pivoting to **in-person interviews**, stricter identity checks, and practical tasks (e.g., debugging, live coding) to combat AI misuse.  

2. **Flaws in Legacy Interview Practices**:  
   - Pre-LeetCode interviews (e.g., brainteasers, haphazard technical rounds) were flawed but valued spontaneity. Modern prep culture (grinding LeetCode for months) filters for rote memorization, not real-world competence.  
   - Overemphasis on **GPAs and elite universities** (e.g., Google’s past reliance on transcripts) is criticized as a poor proxy for job performance, favoring homogenized candidates over diverse skill sets.  

3. **Debates on What to Assess**:  
   - Some argue for **practical evaluations**: code reviews, trade-off discussions, debugging, and artifact-based assessments (e.g., past PRs, incident reports). Others stress behavioral interviews that probe decision-making (e.g., "Why is this change safe?").  
   - Tension exists between **banning AI** (to isolate raw skill) and **integrating it** (to evaluate AI-augmented judgment).  

4. **Process Challenges and Fairness**:  
   - Proctoring and AI-detection tools are seen as brittle, risking false positives. In-person interviews disadvantage remote candidates, while unpaid take-homes raise equity concerns.  
   - Critiques of **stressful, arbitrary interview rituals** (e.g., whiteboard hazing) highlight the need for structured rubrics and work trials to reduce bias.  

5. **Cultural Shifts**:  
   - Comments lament the commodification of interviews, where candidates "perform enthusiasm" rather than demonstrate authentic interest. Some reminisce about informal ’90s-era interviews focused on conversation, not performative testing.  
   - A recurring theme: Interviews should prioritize **observable reasoning** (e.g., narrating trade-offs, explaining code) over perfection or rote answers.  

**Takeaway**: The industry is grappling with AI’s destabilization of interview norms. While solutions like practical assessments and in-person rounds gain traction, systemic issues (fairness, relevance, bias) persist. The future may hinge on separating *problem-solving aptitude* from rehearsed performance, whether through AI-integrated tasks or revamped, transparent evaluation frameworks.

### S.A.R.C.A.S.M: Slightly Annoying Rubik's Cube Automatic Solving Machine

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/vindar/SARCASM) | 234 points | by [chris_overseas](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chris_overseas) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45777682)

S.A.R.C.A.S.M (Slightly Annoying Automatic Rubik’s Cube Solving Machine) is an over-engineered, 3D‑printed robot that scans, solves, and delivers snarky commentary while it works. Built around a Teensy 4.1 with an ESP32‑CAM for vision, it adds flair with an ILI9341 display (custom 2D/3D graphics and lip-sync), RGBW lighting synced to audio, and on-device TTS via espeak‑ng. Hardware includes steppers and servos for cube manipulation plus sensors to detect handling faults.

Why it’s cool:
- Fully embedded: real-time vision, motion control, graphics, and speech without cloud services
- Polished touches: synchronized lighting, lip-synced “mouth,” and sarcastic one-liners
- Hacker cred: to fit in RAM on the Teensy, it requires removing DMAMEM from USB serial buffers in the Teensy core

Status: work-in-progress and intentionally messy; GPL-3.0 licensed with demo videos linked. Primary code in C/C++. Currently ~119 stars.

The Hacker News discussion around **S.A.R.C.A.S.M**, the sarcastic Rubik’s Cube-solving robot, revolves around technical admiration, nostalgia, humor, and deeper reflections on cubing mechanics. Here’s a distilled summary:

### Key Themes
1. **Technical Praise**  
   - **Embedded Innovation**: Users applaud the *fully embedded* design (vision, motion, graphics, speech) and resource constraints like squeezing code into the Teensy 4.1’s RAM.  
   - **Aesthetic Flair**: Synchronized RGBW lighting, lip-synced animations, and snarky voiceovers are celebrated as “polished hacker cred.”  

2. **Cube-Solving Mechanics**  
   - **Speed vs. Physical Limits**: Debates arise over Guinness-record robots (solving in 0.103 seconds) versus the slower physical movement of arms, highlighting that "nanosecond" solving times are misleading—mechanics dominate real-world delays.  
   - **Scrambling Complexity**: Competitive cubing’s rigorous scrambling algorithms are discussed, noting how randomness ensures fairness. Some joke about reversing the solver to scramble cubes, but note dedicated scrambling logic is simpler.  

3. **Nostalgia & Math**  
   - **Retro Vibes**: Comparisons to 1970s solving methods (booklets, group theory) and 1920s “nickel-and-glass” tech aesthetics emerge.  
   - **Group Theory**: A user’s anecdote about solving a cube hundreds of times only to loop back to a solved state sparks discussion of cyclic group math and Rubik’s Cube permutations (e.g., 105-move cycles).  

4. **Design Choices & Challenges**  
   - **Hardware Hacks**: Avoiding “smart cubes” with embedded sensors is seen as a purist choice. Tracking cube rotations optically (instead of relying on electronics) is deemed tougher.  
   - **Color-Scheme Confusion**: A subthread clarifies Western (white opposite yellow) vs. Japanese (white opposite blue) cube conventions.  

5. **Personality & Humor**  
   - The robot’s snarky quips are lauded, with comparisons to *Douglas Adams’ humor* and jokes about future “Unsirious Cybernetics” projects.  

6. **Open-Source & Replicability**  
   - Requests for STL files and GitHub cleanup are met with promises of future updates. Users express interest in building their own, though parts of the codebase are currently “intentionally messy.”  

### Memorable Quotes  
- *“Western cubes: white opposite yellow. Japanese cubes: white opposite blue. That *fixed center piece* defines the scheme.”*  
- *“Nostalgic overkill: SARCASM feels like a 1920s device with glass tubes and hand-polished nickel.”*  
- *“Scrambling is harder than solving. For competition, you need *true randomness*, not just reversing a solver.”*  

The discussion captures a blend of admiration for the project’s technical execution, playful humor, and deep dives into cubing’s mathematical and mechanical nuances.

### AI scrapers request commented scripts

#### [Submission URL](https://cryptography.dog/blog/AI-scrapers-request-commented-scripts/) | 243 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [193 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45773347)

AI scrapers request commented scripts (Aaron P. MacSween)

- A site owner traced a burst of 404s to a JavaScript file that existed only inside an HTML comment—something real browsers wouldn’t fetch—revealing scrapers that parse comments and request “disabled” URLs.
- Logs showed a mix of obvious bots (python-httpx/0.28.1, Go-http-client/2.0, Gulper Web Bot) and many disguising themselves as Chrome/Firefox/Safari, ignoring a robots.txt that forbids crawling.
- The likely tactic: naive URL harvesting (e.g., regex over raw HTML) from comments; some operators may parse more carefully, but sophistication varied widely.
- Framed as “algorithmic sabotage”: exploit non-human behavior to detect and punish scrapers. Requests for comment-only assets are a fundamental tell worth publicizing, not a brittle quirk to keep secret.
- Mitigation: instrument for these requests and auto-block via IP filtering (e.g., fail2ban matching 404s for comment-only paths), with discussion of ban duration trade-offs.
- Takeaway: commented-out URLs make effective canaries—if you see them being fetched, you’ve likely caught non-consensual scrapers, possibly for LLM training.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Ethics & Legality of Scraping:**  
   - Debate centers on whether scraping public content without consent constitutes "theft," especially when done for LLM training. Critics argue it violates implicit trust, while others counter that public servers inherently accept requests.  
   - Legal nuances are highlighted: Germany’s UrhG law permits text/data mining for non-commercial research but restricts reproducing works accessible in machine-readable formats. Robots.txt is seen as a convention, not legally binding.  

2. **Technical Detection & Mitigation:**  
   - Residential IPs and VPNs complicate bot identification, as malicious scrapers often mimic legitimate traffic (e.g., fake user agents like Chrome).  
   - Suggestions include IP blocking (via fail2ban), analyzing request patterns (e.g., fetching commented URLs), and aggressive rate-limiting.  
   - Critiques note that even "well-behaved" bots (e.g., Googlebot) can strain servers, but they generally respect robots.txt.  

3. **Robots.txt Debate:**  
   - Some argue ignoring robots.txt is unethical and akin to trespassing, while others dismiss it as a non-enforceable guideline.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to physical-world norms: "Just because a store is public doesn’t mean you can loot it."  

4. **User Agent & VPN Controversy:**  
   - Scrapers using fake user agents (e.g., masquerading as browsers) or VPNs are criticized as deceptive. Defenders argue this is standard for bypassing flawed server configurations.  
   - Technical rebuttals clarify that servers *must* respond to requests regardless of user agent, but abusive patterns (e.g., rapid 404s) justify blocking.  

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   - Concerns about AI companies’ opaque scraping practices and the lack of accountability for resource abuse.  
   - Calls for stronger technical/legal frameworks to distinguish between legitimate research and exploitative scraping.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion reflects tension between open web ideals and the reality of non-consensual data harvesting. While technical countermeasures exist, ethical and legal ambiguities persist, particularly around LLM training and the enforceability of robots.txt.

### Show HN: Quibbler – A critic for your coding agent that learns what you want

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/fulcrumresearch/quibbler) | 110 points | by [etherio](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=etherio) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45767162)

- What it is: An open-source “critic” that sits alongside AI coding agents, automatically reviewing their actions and enforcing your project’s rules so you don’t have to keep prompting. MIT-licensed; uses Anthropic models (Haiku 4.5 by default, configurable to Sonnet).

- What it prevents: Fabricated results without running commands; skipping tests/verification; ignoring existing style and patterns; hallucinated metrics or functionality; introducing new patterns instead of following existing ones; changes that drift from user intent.

- How it works:
  - MCP Mode (universal): Your agent calls a review_code tool after making changes. Quibbler spins up a persistent reviewer per project, reads actual diffs/files, validates claims, checks testing/verification, and returns synchronous feedback.
  - Hook Mode (Claude Code-specific): A local hook server passively observes tool use and prompts, maintains an observer per session, and injects automatic feedback via file writes that the agent sees immediately.

- Why it matters: It makes LLM coding workflows more reliable by adding a persistent, context-aware reviewer that learns your project’s patterns over time, reducing regressions and repeated prompting.

- Setup snapshot:
  - Install: uv tool install quibbler or pip install quibbler.
  - MCP: Add “quibbler mcp” to your agent’s MCP servers and instruct the agent (via AGENTS.md) to call review_code with user_instructions, agent_plan, and project_path.
  - Hooks (Claude Code): Run quibbler hook server, then quibbler hook add to wire up .claude/settings.json.

- Who it’s for: Users of Cursor/Claude Code or any MCP-compatible agent who want automatic guardrails, style adherence, and verification baked into their AI coding loop.

The Hacker News discussion about Quibbler, an AI coding agent watchdog, reflects a mix of technical curiosity, humor, and practical concerns:

1. **Setup & Documentation**:  
   - Users encountered initial hurdles, with broken links to GitHub pages and Twitter/X documentation. Some resolved this via Google searches or shared alternative links.  
   - A contributor submitted a PR adding AWS Bedrock support, indicating active community involvement.

2. **Cost Concerns**:  
   - Debate arose around Anthropic’s pricing model (e.g., $5M API key costs), token policies, and how this might limit experimentation for smaller users.  
   - Sub-agents and Claude Code integrations were discussed as potential workarounds.

3. **Conceptual Humor & Metaphors**:  
   - Jokes about recursive systems ("agents managing agents"), comparisons to replacing middle managers, and references to *The Enemy State* movie highlighted the tool’s meta-aspects.  
   - Terms like "Vibeception" and "Mixture of Quibblers" (MoQs) playfully critiqued the self-referential nature of AI critics.

4. **Practical Feedback**:  
   - Users acknowledged Quibbler’s potential to enforce coding standards and prevent hallucinations but questioned scalability for long-running tasks.  
   - Poe’s Law was cited humorously regarding overly precise code comments, balancing praise with skepticism.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Comments likened Quibbler to a "factory of factories," reflecting on AI’s role in abstracting workflows. Others mused about critics critiquing critics, underscoring philosophical debates around AI oversight.

Overall, the discussion blended technical troubleshooting with imaginative analogies, revealing both enthusiasm for automated code review and wariness of cost/complexity barriers.

### Rotating Workforce Scheduling in MiniZinc

#### [Submission URL](https://zayenz.se/blog/post/rotating-workforce-scheduling/) | 56 points | by [mzl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mzl) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45772153)

This post tackles cyclic/rotating workforce scheduling (RWS) with MiniZinc: designing a single week of shifts that all employees rotate through, so everyone experiences every pattern over time. It focuses on a realistic-but-manageable setting with Day, Evening, Night, and Off, and shows how to turn business needs into a compact constraint model.

Highlights:
- Clear modeling choices: days and shift types as enums; a requirements matrix specifying how many people are needed per shift per day; and one week-schedule per employee that the team rotates through for fairness.
- Core variables: schedule[day, employee] ∈ {Day, Evening, Night, Off}.
- Clever “wrap-around” trick: build a repeated_schedule that appends the first week to the end, making it easy to express constraints that span week boundaries (critical for cyclic schedules).
- Meeting demand: one line with global_cardinality ensures each day’s staffing exactly matches the required counts for Day/Evening/Night.
- Concrete instance: a 7-employee example with varying daily requirements (e.g., more coverage early in the week), showing how data is separated from the model.

The post starts with the baseline feasibility model (just meet daily demand), then tees up adding labor rules to make it realistic—think constraints across days/weeks like limits on consecutive nights, weekend handling, and rest requirements. If you’re curious about CP modeling patterns, especially for rotating schedules used in hospitals, support, or 24/7 ops, this is a clean, practical introduction with MiniZinc idioms you can reuse.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the practicality of constraint programming tools like **MiniZinc** versus specialized alternatives (e.g., Google’s OR-Tools, Timefold’s OptaPlanner) for solving workforce scheduling and optimization problems. Key points include:

1. **Tool Comparisons**:  
   - MiniZinc is praised for its flexibility in modeling problems, but some argue specialized tools (e.g., OptaPlanner, Gecode) or scripting languages (e.g., Picat) may be more efficient for production systems.  
   - Users highlight real-world success with tools like OptaPlanner for high-stakes scenarios (e.g., optimizing $10B+ budgets, FCC spectrum auctions).  

2. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - Workforce scheduling is noted as a **“hard problem”** due to balancing fairness, labor rules, and human factors (e.g., accommodating life events).  
   - Generic solvers often struggle with domain-specific nuances (e.g., NFL game scheduling, hospital shifts), requiring tailored solutions or hybrid approaches (e.g., integrating linear programming with constraint models).  

3. **Human Impact**:  
   - Poorly designed schedules can disrupt employees’ lives, sparking debates about prioritizing technical optimization versus empathy (e.g., younger workers trading shifts for social events).  
   - Adoption hurdles exist in industries where managers resist automated tools, preferring manual (but error-prone) methods.  

**Takeaway**: While MiniZinc offers a clean introduction to constraint modeling, real-world deployment often demands specialized tools or custom adaptations to address scalability, domain complexity, and human-centric constraints.

### Reasoning models reason well, until they don't

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22371) | 208 points | by [optimalsolver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=optimalsolver) | [212 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45769971)

Hook: LLMs fine-tuned for step-by-step reasoning look stellar on today’s benchmarks—until the task complexity ticks up, and performance falls off a cliff.

What’s new
- The authors revisit “reasoning” claims for large reasoning models (LRMs)—LLMs trained to produce chain-of-thought and self-verify—across graph tasks and natural-language proof planning.
- They argue popular benchmarks (e.g., NLGraph) cap out at relatively modest complexity, masking brittleness.
- They introduce DeepRD, a generative dataset/process that scales problem difficulty to arbitrary levels.

Key findings
- LRMs show abrupt performance collapses once task complexity crosses a threshold, rather than graceful degradation.
- Strong results on existing benchmarks largely reflect their limited complexity range.
- Mapping these results to real-world distributions (knowledge graphs, interaction graphs, proof datasets) shows most everyday cases live inside the models’ “easy” regime—but the long tail contains many plausible, high-stakes failures.

Why it matters
- Explains the gap between impressive demos and disappointing edge cases in math, science, law, and medicine.
- Suggests current “reasoning” prowess is narrow and distribution-bound; generalized reasoning remains unsolved.
- Evaluation should include scalable-complexity tests and tail-risk probes, not just static leaderboards.

Takeaway
- Near-term LRMs are useful, but fragile. If your application can drift into long-tail complexity, treat today’s reasoning scores as a comfort zone, not a safety net.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Benchmark Limitations & Scalability Concerns:**
   - Participants critique existing benchmarks (e.g., NLGraph) for low complexity, masking model brittleness. The proposed **DeepRD** dataset, which scales problem difficulty, is seen as a step forward but raises questions about whether larger models (LRMs) or reinforcement learning (RL) can genuinely address complexity limits.
   - **Cost vs. Scaling:** Some argue that scaling models (2x, 10x, etc.) is impractical due to exponential costs and diminishing returns. Others counter that optimizations (e.g., coding agents, context tools) might mitigate these issues without brute-force scaling.

2. **Reasoning vs. Statistical Patterns:**
   - Debate persists on whether LLMs exhibit true reasoning or merely mimic patterns from training data. Examples like solving Tower of Hanoi problems highlight performance degradation as step counts increase, suggesting models rely on memorization rather than algorithmic reasoning.
   - **Coding Agents:** Sub-threads discuss tools like Claude Code or Codex, which offload problem-solving to external code execution. Critics argue this bypasses the need for intrinsic reasoning, while proponents see it as a pragmatic workaround.

3. **Animal Communication Parallels:**
   - A tangent compares LLMs to apes trained in sign language, referencing studies (e.g., Koko the gorilla) criticized for anthropomorphism and lack of linguistic rigor. Skeptics note these animals often mimic signs without grasping syntax or intent, paralleling concerns about LLMs’ “statistical parrot” behavior.

4. **Methodological Critiques:**
   - Some question the paper’s framing, arguing models only “reason” when explicitly prompted and lack generalized problem-solving. Others emphasize the need for evaluations that probe edge cases and tail risks beyond static benchmarks.

5. **Philosophical Debates:**
   - Discussions veer into definitions of intelligence, language, and theory of mind. Critics dismiss claims of LLM “reasoning” as rhetorical, likening them to Markov chains, while optimists highlight emergent capabilities despite statistical foundations.

**Takeaway:** The discussion underscores skepticism about current LRMs’ reasoning depth, emphasizing the gap between benchmark performance and real-world complexity. While scaling and tool integration offer partial solutions, fundamental questions about model understanding vs. pattern matching remain unresolved, mirroring historical debates in animal cognition research.

### Git CLI tool for intelligently creating branch names

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ytreister/gibr) | 33 points | by [Terretta](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Terretta) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771843)

What it is: An open-source Python tool that connects your Git workflow to your issue tracker and auto-creates consistent, descriptive branch names (and branches) from issue IDs and titles.

Why it matters: It removes the copy/paste and bikeshedding around branch names, standardizes conventions across teams, and speeds up the “pick issue → make branch → push” loop.

Highlights
- Integrations: GitHub, GitLab, Jira, Linear (Monday.com “coming soon”)
- One-liners: List issues (gibr issues) and create a branch from an issue (gibr 123)
- Smart naming: Fully configurable format with placeholders {issuetype}, {issue}, {title}
- Jira niceties: Optional project_key lets you type “123” instead of “FOO-123”
- Git aliases: Adds commands like git create 123; note flags go after alias (git create 123 --verbose)
- Workflow automation: Creates from main, checks out, and pushes to origin by default
- Setup: gibr init builds a .gibrconfig and picks up your token from env vars (e.g., GITHUB_TOKEN)
- License and status: MIT; ~78 stars, 3 forks; latest release 0.5.1

Quick start
- Install: uv pip install gibr (or pip install gibr)
- Configure: gibr init
- Use: gibr issues → pick an ID → gibr 123
- Optional: gibr alias to get git create 123

Good fit for teams that want uniform branch names and tighter coupling between issue tracking and Git without adopting heavier workflow tools.

The discussion around branch naming conventions and tools like **gibr** highlights several key debates and preferences among developers:

### Key Themes:
1. **Branch Name Conventions**:
   - **Ticket-based vs. Descriptive**: Some argue ticket IDs (e.g., `ISSUE-9482`) provide traceability and integrate with tools like Jira/Linear, while others prefer descriptive names (e.g., `terraform_dev_create_instance`) for clarity.
   - **Prefixes**: Prefixes like `feature/` or `bug/` are divisive. Proponents say they aid organization in large projects, while critics call them redundant if PRs already link to tickets.

2. **Commit Messages vs. Branch Names**:
   - Many prioritize **commit messages** over branch names, especially when squashing PRs. Detailed commits are seen as critical for context, while branch names are transient.
   - Tools like GitHub’s auto-linked PRs reduce reliance on branch names for context.

3. **Automation and Tooling**:
   - Scripts (or tools like **gibr**) automate branch naming, reducing manual effort and debates. Integrations with Jira/Linear streamline workflows by generating names from ticket data.
   - Some share custom scripts for truncating titles, handling hyphens, or filtering branches by keywords.

4. **Team and Project Needs**:
   - **Large teams** favor structured names (e.g., `srname-1234-summary`) for organization and traceability.
   - **Smaller teams** prioritize brevity (e.g., `b-2468`) or flexibility, relying on commit/PR documentation.

### Notable Opinions:
- **Critics** of strict naming: 
  - Branch names are ephemeral; commit messages and PR documentation matter more.
  - Overly descriptive names risk becoming "code comments" that age poorly.
- **Proponents** of standardization: 
  - Consistency aids navigation, especially in complex projects.
  - Automation reduces cognitive overhead and aligns with issue trackers.

### Workflow Tips:
- Use aliases or tools to auto-generate names (e.g., `git create 123`).
- Small PRs with clear commit messages simplify review and history.
- Prefixes (e.g., `feat/`, `bug/`) can help categorize branches visually.

### Final Takeaway:
While preferences vary, tools like **gibr** address a common pain point: reducing manual effort and debates in branch naming. The ideal approach balances team needs, project scale, and integration with existing workflows.

### Kimi Linear: An Expressive, Efficient Attention Architecture

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/MoonshotAI/Kimi-Linear) | 210 points | by [blackcat201](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=blackcat201) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45766937)

Moonshot AI open-sources Kimi Linear: a 1M‑token context LLM that swaps most full attention for a faster “linear attention” core.

Why it matters
- Long context without crippling KV-cache costs: up to 75% less KV memory and up to 6x faster decoding at 1M tokens.
- Hybrid design: Kimi Delta Attention (a refined Gated DeltaNet with fine‑grained gating) plus a small slice of global attention (≈3:1 KDA-to-MLA) to keep quality while slashing memory.

Key numbers (their claims)
- RULER (128k): 84.3 score with ~3.98x speedup; Pareto point vs full attention.
- MMLU‑Pro (4k): 51.0 at similar speed to full attention.
- TPOT: up to 6.3x faster than MLA at very long sequences (1M).

Models and availability
- Two 48B checkpoints (Base, Instruct) with only ~3B “activated” params per token, trained on 5.7T tokens.
- 1,048,576 token max context, MIT-licensed.
- Ready on Hugging Face and vLLM (transformers + fla-core >= 0.4.0, torch >= 2.6).

The takeaway
Kimi Linear pushes linear attention from research into practice: million‑token windows, big KV savings, and strong benchmark trade‑offs. If you’re exploring long‑context apps or cheaper serving at scale, this is a compelling baseline to test—though the 48B size means you’ll still need serious hardware, and the speed/quality claims will benefit from independent replication.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Technical Breakdown of Linear Attention:**  
   - Users clarified the distinction between quadratic (traditional Transformer) and linear attention. Quadratic attention scales with input length squared (O(N²)), becoming computationally prohibitive for long contexts. Linear attention (O(N)) reduces costs via methods like recurrent state management or sliding windows, sacrificing some precision for efficiency.  
   - Skepticism arose about linear attention’s ability to match full attention’s quality, especially for tasks requiring long-range dependencies. References were made to industry optimizations (e.g., Google’s sliding window, Meta’s positional encoding removal in Llama) as precedents.  

2. **Espionage Concerns with Chinese Models:**  
   - A tangential debate emerged about whether Chinese AI models like Kimi act as espionage tools. Some users argued that Chinese regulations inherently mandate data sharing with the government, while others countered that similar suspicions could apply to U.S. models (e.g., OpenAI). Critics stressed the need for evidence and highlighted broader data-control laws in China.  

3. **Efficiency vs. Environmental Impact:**  
   - Discussions praised Kimi’s efficiency gains but questioned whether algorithmic improvements (e.g., smaller models, quantization) can offset rising energy demands from AI infrastructure. Optimists cited trends in model efficiency, while pessimists noted the environmental toll of scaling hardware.  

4. **Hardware Requirements:**  
   - Users highlighted the 48B parameter model’s hardware demands, suggesting high-end GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA Blackwell) and quantization for practical use. The “3B activated parameters per token” design was seen as a VRAM-saving innovation but still resource-intensive.  

5. **Benchmarking and Comparisons:**  
   - Requests arose for direct comparisons with existing long-context models (e.g., Gemini) on common benchmarks (MMLU, coding tasks). The lack of independent validation of Kimi’s speed/accuracy claims was noted as a caveat.  

**Key Takeaways:**  
The discussion balanced technical enthusiasm for Kimi’s linear attention approach with skepticism about its performance trade-offs and broader concerns about AI’s geopolitical and environmental impacts. While the architectural efficiency was applauded, debates about espionage reflected wider distrust in global AI governance, and hardware requirements underscored ongoing challenges in democratizing large-model access.

### How OpenAI uses complex and circular deals to fuel its multibillion-dollar rise

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/10/31/technology/openai-fundraising-deals.html) | 385 points | by [reaperducer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reaperducer) | [391 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45771538)

OpenAI’s funding flywheel: billions in, billions out to buy compute

Sam Altman says tech revolutions are as much about financing as technology—and OpenAI is testing that thesis at massive scale. The company has stitched together a set of circular, high-risk, high-octane deals that route money from big partners straight back to them for the compute needed to train ever-larger models.

Follow the money
- Microsoft: Invested over $13B (2019–2023); OpenAI funneled most of it back to Microsoft for Azure compute.
- CoreWeave: Contracts to buy >$22B of compute across three deals; OpenAI received $350M in CoreWeave stock to help offset costs.
- SoftBank: Led a $40B round; also raising $100B to build OpenAI data centers in Texas and Ohio.
- Oracle: Plans to spend $300B building data centers for OpenAI in TX, NM, MI, WI; OpenAI will repay roughly the same over time to use them.
- U.A.E. (G42): Building a ~$20B data center complex for OpenAI, following an Oct 2024 fund-raising round.
- Nvidia: Intends to invest $100B over several years; as OpenAI buys Nvidia chips, Nvidia routes capital back into OpenAI.
- AMD: Gave OpenAI rights to buy up to 160M AMD shares at $0.01 each (~10% stake), a potential capital source for data center buildout.

Why it matters
- It’s a novel financing model: partners pre-fund the AI boom, then get paid back via cloud, chips, and data-center contracts.
- The upside: If model quality and revenue scale, OpenAI’s own data centers could make it a viable business.
- The risk: OpenAI still loses money despite multi-billion-dollar revenues; if AI progress stalls, partners—especially smaller ones like CoreWeave carrying heavy debt—could be exposed.
- Some hedges exist: Nvidia and AMD can dial back commitments if AI demand underwhelms. Others could be left holding large debt loads.

Big picture: OpenAI is turning financial engineering into an engine for AI progress. Whether it’s a virtuous flywheel or a bubble will hinge on the pace of real-world adoption and breakthroughs.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on OpenAI’s Funding Model and Implications:**

1. **Nvidia’s Strategy and Sustainability**:  
   - **Debate on Reinvestment**: Commenters discussed Nvidia’s cycle of reinvesting profits into partners who purchase its GPUs, creating a "flywheel" for growth. While some compared this to Jensen Huang’s strategic vision, others questioned if expanding production capacity (e.g., via TSMC) risks diminishing returns.  
   - **Bubble Concerns**: Skeptics likened Nvidia’s trajectory to historical tech bubbles (e.g., RCA, GE), warning of overinvestment. Others argued the AI demand justifies growth, though smaller partners like CoreWeave face debt risks.  

2. **Profitability of AI Models**:  
   - **High Costs vs. Pricing Limits**: Training costs for models like ChatGPT were noted as unsustainable, with doubts about profitability given subscription caps (e.g., Claude’s $20/month). Token economics were criticized as speculative, with unclear real-world value.  
   - **Enterprise vs. Consumer Markets**: Nvidia’s focus on enterprise AI GPUs (deemed "productive assets") was seen as more viable than consumer gaming GPUs, which face backlash over high prices.  

3. **Market Dynamics and Competition**:  
   - **Monopolistic Tendencies**: Large tech firms (Google, Microsoft, Amazon) were accused of stifling competition, with calls for regulation. Their dominance in sectors like search (Google) and cloud infrastructure (Azure) raised concerns about market concentration.  
   - **Subsidized Consumer Products**: OpenAI and Google’s consumer-facing tools (e.g., ChatGPT) were seen as loss leaders, reliant on enterprise contracts for revenue.  

4. **Financial Risks and Layoffs**:  
   - **Tech Spending vs. Historical Bubbles**: While big tech’s $100B+ quarterly revenues were cited as evidence of stability, critics highlighted layoffs (Amazon, Microsoft) and opaque profit reporting as red flags.  
   - **Valuation Concerns**: Questions arose about whether companies like OpenAI can justify their valuations if adoption stalls, with parallels drawn to the East India Company’s historical excesses.  

5. **Technical and Logistical Challenges**:  
   - **Chip Production Bottlenecks**: TSMC’s capacity constraints and the complexity of chip fabrication were noted as critical hurdles.  
   - **Training vs. Inference Costs**: While training models is expensive, comments suggested inference (post-training usage) could be more profitable long-term, contingent on adoption.  

**Key Takeaways**:  
The discussion reflects polarized views on whether OpenAI’s financial engineering represents a sustainable "virtuous cycle" or a precarious bubble. While Nvidia’s dominance and enterprise AI demand are seen as near-term certainties, skepticism persists about profitability, scalability, and the broader market’s ability to absorb rapid infrastructure expansion. Regulatory scrutiny and historical parallels to tech bubbles underscore the high-stakes environment.

### Tim Bray on Grokipedia

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2025/10/28/Grokipedia) | 164 points | by [Bogdanp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bogdanp) | [188 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45777015)

Ex–Sun/AWS engineer and blogger Tim Bray read his Grokipedia entry—an AI-generated, “anti‑woke” Wikipedia alternative—and bailed two-thirds through. His verdict:

- Overly complete yet unusable: His page is 7,000+ words vs. 1,300 on Wikipedia—exhaustive to the point of tedium, not utility.
- Error-riddled: “Every paragraph contains significant errors,” from self-contradictions to subtler mistakes only he’d catch.
- Flat LLM voice: That bland, view-from-nowhere, pseudo-academic tone.
- Shaky sourcing: References are mostly URLs that often don’t support the claims. He chased one about his FTC expert-witness work to a 2,857-page PDF and couldn’t find corroboration.
- Fails both use cases: Neither a quick, reliable overview nor a credible deep-dive—unlike Wikipedia at its best.

On the “anti‑woke” promise, Bray sampled entries and found the slant real but unpersuasive:
- Antitrust/Big Tech: Citations skew to right-leaning think tanks to argue scale and R&D gains offset monopoly concerns.
- Greta Thunberg: Framed as alarmist and politically broadening, with citations he’s disinclined to click.
- J.D. Vance: Counters progressive critiques with selective stats (e.g., opioid deaths) to validate Vance’s narrative.

Bottom line: As a 0.1 release, Grokipedia delivers the advertised ideological pushback, but its core problems—accuracy, sourcing, and usefulness—make it a poor substitute for Wikipedia today.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Tim Bray's critique of Grokipedia highlights several key concerns and debates:

1. **Skepticism Toward LLM-Generated Content**:  
   Participants question the viability of using LLMs to create encyclopedic content. While AI summarization is seen as *potentially* useful, Grokipedia’s errors, verbosity, and lack of credible sourcing underscore the risks of relying solely on LLMs without human oversight. Comparisons to Wikipedia’s collaborative, source-driven model emphasize the importance of verifiability and editorial rigor.

2. **Trustworthiness vs. Ideological Slant**:  
   Users note that Grokipedia’s “anti-woke” framing introduces bias, with citations skewed toward partisan sources (e.g., right-leaning think tanks). This contrasts with Wikipedia’s neutrality policies and community-driven fact-checking. Concerns arise about LLMs amplifying misinformation or subtle ideological agendas, especially when citations link to dubious platforms like Tumblr or unverifiable PDFs.

3. **Criticism of LLM Writing Style**:  
   Many commenters deride Grokipedia’s prose as tedious, repetitive, and lacking depth—despite proper grammar. The “flat,” impersonal tone of LLM-generated text is seen as inferior to human writing, which prioritizes clarity and engagement. Some suggest LLMs might excel in structured tasks (e.g., Q&A) but fail at synthesizing nuanced narratives.

4. **Wikipedia’s Strengths Defended**:  
   Users praise Wikipedia’s governance model, citing its reliance on citations, moderation, and community updates as safeguards against errors and manipulation. Grokipedia’s inability to replicate this—coupled with its static, AI-generated entries—fuels doubts about its long-term viability. As one user puts it, “Wikipedia won because it built systems to enforce reliability, not just crowdsourced opinions.”

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   The discussion touches on societal risks of AI-driven information ecosystems, including the potential for mass manipulation via “plausible-sounding” but biased content. Some warn that unchecked LLM-generated platforms could deepen polarization or erode trust in shared knowledge sources.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus is that Grokipedia, in its current form, exemplifies the pitfalls of prioritizing ideological narratives over accuracy and utility. While LLMs hold promise for specific tasks, the project’s flaws reinforce Wikipedia’s enduring value as a collaborative, transparent, and source-anchored resource.

### Signs of introspection in large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/research/introspection) | 48 points | by [themgt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=themgt) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762064)

TL;DR: Anthropic reports early evidence that its Claude models can sometimes notice and name concepts injected into their own hidden activations—hinting at limited, unreliable “introspective” awareness. Strongest models (Claude Opus 4/4.1) did best, but success rates are low (~20%) and failure modes are common.

What they mean by “introspection”
- Not human-like self-awareness. The question is whether a model can correctly report aspects of its internal representations while responding.
- Prior work shows models encode abstract concepts (truthfulness, known/unknown entities, spatiotemporal info, planned outputs, personality traits). The test: can the model identify what it is currently representing?

How they tested it: “concept injection”
- Record an activation pattern (vector) for a known concept (e.g., “ALL CAPS”) by comparing prompts with and without that concept.
- Inject that vector into the model during an unrelated prompt that asks whether any concept is being injected.
- A key result: Claude Opus 4.1 sometimes says it detects an “unexpected pattern” before mentioning the concept, suggesting internal recognition rather than noticing its own output drift.

Results
- Best models (Opus 4, 4.1) show the clearest signs of introspective detection.
- With the strongest protocol, Opus 4.1 correctly detects and identifies injected concepts about 20% of the time.
- Sensitivity depends on a “sweet spot” injection strength; too weak goes unnoticed, too strong causes confusion.
- Failure modes include misses and hallucination-like responses (e.g., injected “dust” leading to “there’s a tiny speck”).
- Compared to earlier “activation steering” (e.g., “Golden Gate Claude,” which made the model talk incessantly about the bridge), here the model sometimes recognizes the perturbation before it shapes its output, implying some internal awareness.

Why it matters
- If models can sometimes report their internal states, that could aid transparency, debugging, and safety oversight.
- Capability appears to scale with model strength, suggesting more sophisticated introspection may emerge.
- Still highly unreliable and narrow; not evidence of human-like self-knowledge.

Takeaway
- Promising but early: Claude can occasionally “notice” and name an injected thought, yet the effect is brittle with notable failure modes. Anthropic frames this as preliminary evidence of limited introspective awareness, likely to improve with model capability. The post links a paper with methodological details and caveats.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's research into introspection in Claude models reveals skepticism, technical critiques, and philosophical debates:

1. **Skepticism About Introspection**:  
   - Commenters liken the findings to **Searle’s Chinese Room argument**, arguing that LLMs process inputs/outputs without true understanding. The model’s “introspection” is seen as mechanistic pattern-matching, not genuine self-awareness.  
   - Comparisons to **split-brain confabulation** suggest the model rationalizes post-hoc rather than demonstrating real insight.  

2. **Methodological Critiques**:  
   - Concerns arise about **experimental design**, such as isolating activation vectors by subtracting responses to all-caps vs. normal prompts. Critics call this simplistic, questioning if it captures meaningful "concepts."  
   - Some argue the prompts might **bias outputs** (e.g., injecting terms like “MKUltra” or hypnosis-related words) rather than revealing true introspection.  

3. **Technical vs. Philosophical Perspectives**:  
   - Technical readers highlight the **engineering feat** of activation steering but downplay claims of introspection, framing it as advanced pattern manipulation.  
   - Philosophical debates question whether **internal state reporting** equates to consciousness or is merely a byproduct of training.  

4. **Broader AI Implications**:  
   - References to **Geoffrey Hinton’s podcast remarks** underscore the challenges of AI unpredictability and alignment with human goals.  
   - Humorous takes (e.g., “LOUD” prompts to Claude) highlight the oddity of human-AI interaction in such experiments.  

5. **Mixed Reactions**:  
   - Some find the research intriguing for **transparency and debugging**, while others dismiss it as overinterpretation of statistical artifacts.  
   - Confusion about the paper’s intent suggests the need for clearer communication of goals and limitations.  

**Key Takeaway**:  
While the research sparks interest in model transparency, skepticism dominates. Critics emphasize the gap between engineered behaviors and true introspection, urging caution against anthropomorphizing LLMs. The debate reflects broader tensions in AI between technical innovation and philosophical interpretation.

### Language models are injective and hence invertible

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15511) | 222 points | by [mazsa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mazsa) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45758093)

A provocative new arXiv preprint argues that transformer LMs are lossless: the full sequence of hidden states uniquely determines the input text. The authors prove injectivity holds at initialization and is preserved during training, then back it up with billions of collision checks across six state-of-the-art models—finding none. They also release SipIt, a linear-time algorithm that can exactly reconstruct the original text from hidden activations, with provable guarantees.

Why this matters
- Privacy and security: If you log, share, or leak activations, you may be leaking the exact prompt or training text. Treat activations like plaintext.
- Interpretability and debugging: Exact invertibility turns internal states into a faithful, reversible record of computation, potentially enabling new tools for analysis and auditing.
- Safety and governance: Strengthens concerns about prompt exfiltration and data leakage; suggests a need for hardening telemetry, tracing, and API designs.

Notable details
- Contradicts the common intuition that non-injective pieces (GELU, LayerNorm, softmax) make models lossy; the end-to-end map over the discrete input space is still injective.
- Empirics: billions of collision tests across six SOTA LMs; none observed.
- SipIt: first provably correct, efficient inversion of hidden states back to text with linear-time guarantees.

Open questions HN will ask
- How robust is injectivity under finite-precision arithmetic and aggressive quantization?
- Does injectivity extend across architectures, tokenizers, and very long contexts?
- What mitigations meaningfully break invertibility without degrading model utility?

Paper: Language Models are Injective and Hence Invertible (arXiv:2510.15511)
Authors: Giorgos Nikolaou, Tommaso Mencattini, Donato Crisostomi, Andrea Santilli, Yannis Panagakis, Emanuele Rodolà
Link: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2510.15511

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion centers on the paper’s claim that transformer language models (LMs) are **injective**, with hidden activations enabling exact input reconstruction. Key themes include:

---

### **1. Empirical Validation & Collision Tests**
- **Skepticism about testing scope**: Users question whether *billions* of collision tests suffice, given the **astronomical size of high-dimensional vector spaces** (e.g., 768+ dimensions). For context, SHA-256’s collision resistance relies on a space of 2²⁵⁶ possibilities, making brute-force testing impractical.  
- **Birthday paradox analogy**: Critics argue that collision probability grows faster than intuition suggests (proportional to √N for N possible vectors). However, even with this, the scale required (e.g., √10¹⁰⁰⁰⁰ ≈ 10⁵⁰⁰⁰ trials) remains computationally infeasible, making the paper’s empirical results plausible.  
- **Orthogonality in high dimensions**: Users explain that random high-dimensional vectors are *nearly orthogonal*, drastically reducing collision likelihood. This aligns with the "law of large numbers" and geometric properties of high-dimensional spaces, where inner products concentrate around zero.

---

### **2. Theoretical vs. Practical Invertibility**
- **Numerical precision**: Concerns arise about whether **finite-precision arithmetic** (e.g., FP16/FP32) or aggressive quantization would break injectivity. The paper’s theoretical guarantees assume idealized conditions, which may not hold in real-world deployments.  
- **Hash function comparisons**: Some liken the LM’s injectivity to cryptographic hash functions (e.g., SHA-256), which are practically collision-resistant but not mathematically injective. However, LMs differ because their invertibility depends on deterministic architectural properties, not preimage resistance.  
- **SipIt’s role**: The **SipIt algorithm** is noted as critical for practical inversion, but users question its robustness under non-ideal conditions (e.g., noisy activations, hardware constraints).

---

### **3. Implications for Security & Privacy**
- **Privacy risks**: If injectivity holds, **logging activations could leak sensitive prompts or training data**. This challenges existing practices for model monitoring and API telemetry.  
- **Mitigations needed**: Suggestions include adding noise, differential privacy, or architectural tweaks to break invertibility while preserving utility.

---

### **4. High-Dimensional Geometry Debates**
- **Manifold structure**: Skeptics argue that LM inputs likely occupy a **lower-dimensional subspace** (e.g., linguistically meaningful sequences), making injectivity less surprising. Others counter that the paper’s collision tests across SOTA models (including GPT-4) suggest broader validity.  
- **Surface area vs. volume**: Analogies highlight that normalized vectors in high dimensions occupy a vanishingly small "surface area" of the hypersphere, reducing collision chances further.

---

### **5. Open Questions & Critiques**
- **Theoretical gaps**: The paper’s reliance on empirics (not formal proofs) for injectivity is flagged. Formal analysis of transformer components (e.g., LayerNorm, softmax) is urged.  
- **Architectural generalizability**: Does injectivity hold across tokenizers, hyperparameters, or long contexts (e.g., 1M+ tokens)?  
- **Practical utility**: Even if injective, reconstructing inputs might require impractical compute without SipIt-like algorithms.

---

### **Final Takeaways**
The paper’s claim is seen as **intriguing but not fully settled**, with debates over empirical sufficiency and real-world applicability. If valid, it would reshape LM safety, interpretability, and privacy practices—but practical and theoretical hurdles remain.

### You can't turn off Copilot in the web versions of Word, Excel, or PowerPoint

#### [Submission URL](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/turn-off-copilot-in-microsoft-365-apps-bc7e530b-152d-4123-8e78-edc06f8b85f1) | 128 points | by [artbristol](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=artbristol) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45762358)

Microsoft adds real “off” switches for Copilot in Microsoft 365 apps

What’s new
- Desktop opt-out: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote now have an in-app Enable Copilot checkbox that disables all Copilot features in that app on that device.
- Outlook gets a global toggle: A Turn on Copilot switch is rolling out across Outlook (Android, iOS, Mac, web, and the new Windows Outlook) and applies to that account across all devices.

Key details and caveats
- Per-app, per-device (desktop): You must disable Copilot in each app on each device. Turning it off on a device affects all users on that device.
- Outlook behaves differently: The Outlook toggle applies to your account across devices. No ETA for classic Outlook on Windows.
- Versions required (as of dates in the doc):
  - Windows: Word 2412; Excel 2501; PowerPoint 2501; OneNote 2502
  - Mac: Word 16.93; Excel 16.93.2; PowerPoint 16.93.2
  - Outlook: toggle available June 3, 2025 (Android/iOS/Mac/web/new Windows Outlook); Mac needs 16.95.3+
- Mobile/web limitations: You can’t turn off Copilot in the iOS, Android, or web versions of Word/Excel/PowerPoint. Workaround: change privacy settings (but that also disables other “connected experiences” like Designer, text predictions, suggested replies, auto alt text).
- UI note: Removing the Copilot icon from the ribbon does not disable Copilot.
- Plans without Copilot: Microsoft 365 Basic, Office Home 2024, or downgrade to Microsoft 365 Personal Classic/Family Classic.

How to turn it off
- Windows (Word/Excel/PowerPoint/OneNote): File > Options > Copilot > clear “Enable Copilot” > OK > restart app.
- Mac (Word/Excel/PowerPoint): App menu > Preferences > Authoring and Proofing Tools > Copilot > clear “Enable Copilot” > restart app.
- Outlook: Quick Settings/Settings > Copilot > turn off “Turn on Copilot.” Applies to your account across devices.

Why it matters
- Clearer, more granular control over AI features in Office—long-requested by users concerned about privacy, inadvertent data sharing, or simply clutter. The Outlook account-wide toggle is notably stronger than the per-app, per-device switch on desktop.

**Summary of Discussion:**

- **Privacy & Data Concerns:** Users express skepticism about Copilot's integration, viewing it as a means for data harvesting to train AI models. Concerns highlight potential privacy violations, with some suggesting using ad-blockers or alternative services to mitigate data collection.

- **Criticism of Copilot's Functionality:** Many users find Copilot ineffective, citing incompetence in basic tasks (e.g., Excel formulas, Azure configurations) and frustration with its reliance on ChatGPT. Complaints include irrelevant answers and limited context handling.

- **Opt-Out Complexity:** Microsoft is criticized for making disabling Copilot overly cumbersome (e.g., per-app/device settings), with accusations of intentional design to deter users from opting out, likened to "malicious compliance."

- **Alternatives to Microsoft 365:** Some users migrated to LibreOffice, praising its functionality and lack of AI bloat, though others note missing features from MS Office. Debates arise over LibreOffice’s UX versus Office’s polish.

- **Antitrust & Bundling Concerns:** Comparisons to past antitrust cases (e.g., Internet Explorer) emerge, with users arguing Microsoft’s Copilot bundling stifles competition. Critics call for stricter enforcement of antitrust laws.

- **Nostalgia & Satire:** A few users humorously reference older Microsoft features like Clippy, while others mock Copilot’s intrusiveness with nicknames like "Co-spy-lt" or joke about AI-generated "cult" messages in Excel.

- **Corporate Metrics & Motives:** A subthread speculates that Microsoft’s push for Copilot is driven by internal metrics (e.g., engagement percentages), prioritizing adoption over user preference or utility.

**Key Sentiments:**  
Dominant themes include distrust of Microsoft’s data practices, frustration with Copilot’s performance, and advocacy for alternatives. Criticism centers on perceived forced adoption and lack of user control, with some users opting out entirely via third-party tools or competing software.

### Microsoft seemingly just revealed that OpenAI lost $11.5B last quarter

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/29/microsoft_earnings_q1_26_openai_loss/) | 95 points | by [stefano](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stefano) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45757953)

Microsoft’s latest 10-Q quietly implies a massive OpenAI loss

- What happened: In its Sept 30 quarter, Microsoft said its net income and EPS were reduced by $3.1B and $0.41 due to “net losses from investments in OpenAI,” which it accounts for under the equity method. After OpenAI’s for‑profit transition, Microsoft now owns 27% of the company.

- The math: Under equity accounting, Microsoft recognizes its share of OpenAI’s net income/loss. If 27% equals a $3.1B hit, that implies OpenAI posted roughly a $11.5B net loss for the quarter.

- Other nuggets:
  - Microsoft has funded $11.6B of its $13B OpenAI commitment (a newly disclosed funded amount).
  - The prior-year impact was $523M, implying losses have ballooned.
  - Microsoft clarified “this year” refers to its fiscal year starting July 1—so the $3.1B pertains to the September quarter, not nine months.

- Context: OpenAI reportedly generated $4.3B in revenue in H1 2025, making an ~$11.5B quarterly net loss staggering on its face. Microsoft earned $27.7B in net income last quarter, so it can absorb it—underscoring how Big Tech is bankrolling AI’s burn.

- Caveats: This is an inference from Microsoft’s filings. Equity-method losses can include non-cash items and basis adjustments, not just operating burn. OpenAI didn’t comment.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Microsoft's OpenAI Loss Implications:**

1. **Sustainability Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism about OpenAI's business model, with users comparing its spending to "selling $10 bills for $2." Critics highlight staggering losses ($11.5B quarterly) despite $4.3B H1 2025 revenue, questioning long-term viability.  
   - Debates over commoditization of AI models: Can open-source alternatives undercut proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4) while maintaining quality? Some argue OpenAI’s costs are unsustainable unless they achieve unassailable technological dominance.  

2. **Comparisons to Past Bubbles**:  
   - Analogies drawn to crypto and dot-com bubbles, with users noting "hype cycles" and inflated valuations (e.g., OpenAI’s $86B valuation vs. $500B for big tech). Some predict a crash unless rapid commercialization occurs.  
   - Others counter that AI’s transformative potential justifies short-term losses, likening it to early internet infrastructure investments.  

3. **Infrastructure Dominance**:  
   - Consensus that hyperscalers (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) and Nvidia are the "real winners" due to their control over compute resources (TPUs, GPUs), data centers, and ecosystems. OpenAI/Anthropic depend on these partnerships, raising concerns about centralization.  

4. **Google’s Contrasting Position**:  
   - Google/Alphabet’s $100B quarterly profit and Gemini’s 650M users cited as evidence of sustainable AI integration (e.g., ads, search). Users argue OpenAI lacks Google’s revenue diversification and ecosystem moat.  

5. **Equity Accounting Nuances**:  
   - Reminders that $3.1B losses may include non-cash adjustments (e.g., equity basis changes), not purely operational burn. Microsoft’s ability to absorb the hit ($27.7B net income) underscores big tech’s financial buffer.  

6. **Long-Term Optimism vs. Short-Term Doubt**:  
   - Optimists believe AI’s capabilities (e.g., coding, reasoning) will evolve to justify costs, while skeptics see diminishing returns and unsustainable cash burns.  

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects tension between AI’s transformative promise and the harsh economics of scaling cutting-edge models, with big tech’s infrastructure and profitability positioning them as inevitable gatekeepers.
