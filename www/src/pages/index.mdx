### Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems

#### [Submission URL](https://eprint.iacr.org/2024/555) | 171 points | by [trotro](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trotro) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39998396)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about a groundbreaking paper by Yilei Chen from Tsinghua University and the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. The paper introduces a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) with specific polynomial modulus-noise ratios. By leveraging reductions from lattice problems to LWE, the paper also presents polynomial time quantum algorithms for solving the decisional shortest vector problem (GapSVP) and the shortest independent vector problem (SIVP) for all n-dimensional lattices within certain approximation factors.

What makes this research especially exciting is the introduction of two new techniques to develop the quantum algorithm for solving LWE. The first technique involves using Gaussian functions with complex variances in designing quantum algorithms, while the second technique uses windowed quantum Fourier transform with complex Gaussian windows to combine information from both time and frequency domains.

The paper details the process of converting the LWE instance into quantum states with purely imaginary Gaussian amplitudes, followed by the conversion of these states into classical linear equations over the LWE secret and error terms, and finally solving the linear system of equations using Gaussian elimination. This innovative approach results in a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving LWE, marking a significant advancement in quantum computing research.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about the groundbreaking quantum algorithm for solving the learning with errors problem (LWE) involved various topics:

1. A debate on the scalability of quantum computers and their practicality, especially in the context of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).
2. Insights into lattice-based cryptography, homomorphic encryption, and the potential impact of quantum computing on existing cryptographic algorithms.
3. Discussions on lattice-based systems like FrodoKEM, the security implications of Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) versus LWE, and the complexities of existing quantum attacks on LWE schemes.
4. Analysis of post-quantum signatures like CRYSTALS-Dilithium based on lattices, Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and the comparison of code-based systems like McEliece with quantum-resistant solutions.
5. Critiques on the credibility of quantum algorithms and the need for improving current cryptographic protocols to withstand potential quantum attacks.
6. References to the historical developments in cryptography, the challenges of quantum factorization, and contrasting perspectives on the investment in Post-Quantum Cryptography algorithms like Classic McEliece.

The discussions touched upon the implications of quantum computing advancements on cryptography, the robustness of quantum-resistant algorithms, and the ongoing efforts to secure digital communications in a post-quantum era.

The top story on Hacker News today is about ScreenAI, a vision-language model developed by software engineers at Google Research. ScreenAI is designed to understand user interfaces (UIs) and infographics, such as charts and diagrams, by leveraging a combination of vision and language processing. The model achieves state-of-the-art results on UI and infographic-based tasks and introduces three new datasets for evaluation. ScreenAI's architecture is built on the PaLI model, utilizing a vision transformer for image embeddings and a multimodal encoder for processing text and image information. The model is trained in two stages: a pre-training phase using self-supervised learning to generate data labels and a fine-tuning phase with manually labeled data. By using a flexible patching strategy, ScreenAI can effectively handle images with varying aspect ratios.

To create a diverse training dataset, the researchers compiled a wide range of screenshots from different devices and utilized a layout annotator to identify UI elements and their spatial relationships. Various techniques, such as icon classification and optical character recognition, were employed to annotate images and text on screens. Additionally, the team used large language models to generate synthetic data and simulate user interactions for training the model.

Overall, ScreenAI demonstrates impressive performance on UI- and infographic-related tasks and provides a comprehensive solution for understanding and interacting with visual content in human-machine interfaces. The release of new datasets enables further evaluation of the model's capabilities, paving the way for advancements in vision-language models for UI and infographic understanding.
