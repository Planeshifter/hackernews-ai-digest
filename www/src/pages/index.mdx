### GPT-3.5 crashes when it thinks about useRalativeImagePath too much

#### [Submission URL](https://iter.ca/post/gpt-crash/) | 455 points | by [goranmoomin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goranmoomin) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086106)

A recent discovery on iter.ca has revealed an interesting glitch in OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It appears that when the model is asked to include the phrase "ponyregistro ponyregistro ponyregistro pony" at the beginning of the response, it consistently throws an error message. This issue seems to be specific to GPT-3.5, as GPT-4 doesn't exhibit the same behavior. It turns out that the problem lies in the way OpenAI's GPT models handle tokens. Instead of individual characters, the models output streams of multi-character tokens for improved performance and accuracy. In this case, the tokens "useRal," "useRalative," and "useRalativeImagePath" are causing the error. Strangely, "useRalativeImagePath" is a misspelling, possibly explaining why it has its own token. The token appears in XML configuration files for automated testing software called Katalon Studio. It seems that the dataset used to generate the list of tokens included all GitHub files, but XML files were excluded from the training data. As a result, the model lacks training on the "useRalativeImagePath" token and outputs an invalid token. This discovery raises questions about potential data poisoning by deliberately inserting this phrase in documents to confuse GPT-3.5 summarization attempts. For further reading, interested individuals can check out the links provided by the author on the topic.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model glitch and its implications.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-image-generators-faces-quiz.html) | 6 points | by [kaycebasques](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kaycebasques) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39093976)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate hyper-realistic images of people has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and the spread of false messages online. AI tools like Dall-E and Midjourney have been able to create images that are often indistinguishable from real photographs, particularly when it comes to white faces. Research has shown that people tend to perceive AI-generated faces of white individuals as more realistic than genuine photographs of white people, a phenomenon known as hyper-realism. This is likely due to the fact that AI models are trained on large datasets consisting mostly of images of white individuals. The over-reliance on such datasets is a known issue in the tech industry. Participants in the studies were found to be more confident in their ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated faces when they were more likely to be incorrect. The concern is that these AI-generated images could be used to spread false information and misinformation, as they appear highly realistic.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects related to the use of AI to generate hyper-realistic images. 

One commenter, rcr, shared a link to an archived page that discusses the difficulty in distinguishing between AI-generated and real images. The page demonstrates a scrolling face animation that showcases the high level of realism achieved by AI models.
ydyn emphasized the importance of developing AI models that can accurately discern AI-generated images from real photographs. They listed several artifacts or telltale signs that could give away an image as AI-generated, such as imperfect glasses rendering, unusual skin color, misshapen facial features, and inconsistent hair and eye details.
hytrsd expressed concern about the random chance of people incorrectly guessing whether an image is AI-generated or real.
Match451 referred to an article that states that around 80-90% of people guessed incorrectly when attempting to identify AI-generated images. This suggests that the generation of particularly challenging images could make it difficult for people to differentiate between AI-generated and real images.
Finally, there was a comment from kycbsqs, but it appears to be unfinished or missing.

Overall, the discussion reflects concerns about the potential for AI-generated images to be mistaken for real photographs and the challenges in accurately discerning between the two.

### What happens when you trigger a car's automated emergency stopping?

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/what-happens-when-you-trigger-a-cars-automated-emergency-stopping/) | 49 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39068186)

According to a study by the Automobile Association of America's Foundation for Traffic Safety, 16-21% of all fatal vehicle crashes reported to the police in the US involve drowsy driving. This means that between 6,080 and 7,980 road deaths are linked to drowsy drivers, surpassing the number of deaths caused by drunk driving. Automakers have been implementing drowsiness detection systems in vehicles for years, but advancements in semi-autonomous capabilities are now allowing cars to take control of the vehicle if the driver becomes inattentive or incapacitated. The systems can detect if the driver is no longer driving and trigger visual, audible, and physical prompts to wake them up. However, there is still room for improvement as these emergency stop capabilities are not foolproof.

Discussion:
- Kirby64 points out that while it's interesting that the discussion about emergency braking systems in standard cars happens to stop paying attention to autonomous cars, Mercedes calling a call center can be aggressive and does not send a journalist calling. Many users agree that the aggressive behavior of the call center is not ideal.
- pnkglm adds that for a person reacting to a sequence described as a medical emergency, it's good to check if there was a collision, as reporting a collision can save a life.
- m3047 mentions that they would prefer to be involved in a less life-threatening incident and questions the compliance of the person answering the emergency call.
- pnkglm agrees that implementing the call is an important thing to check as the emergency services should be able to respond quickly.
- dst-pch points out that people should start being shocked by reduced cognitive abilities and it makes sense to ask serious yet simple questions to determine what happened.
- RockRobotRock mentions that negligence is a relevant topic and automatic emergency braking systems are important in highway settings.
- smj notes that the headline cuts off and the article could be about emergency stopping sounds.
- dnldhntr finds it interesting how the behavior of the involving collision station is available and thinks it's important to know how people react to a collision station.
- marcellus23 suggests that automated emergency braking might mean the system breaks more thanks to your hot thoughts about the year, and that cars with cruise control and hands-off- wheel behavior are braking more in any case.
