In a game-changing development for machine learning efficiency, a new paper by Jacob Fein-Ashley titled "The FFT Strikes Back: An Efficient Alternative to Self-Attention" offers a novel approach to the challenge of scaling self-attention mechanisms. Traditionally hampered by quadratic complexity, self-attention has struggled with long sequence processing—until now. Enter FFTNet, a framework that cleverly uses the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to achieve what the paper claims as superior global token mixing with an impressive $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$ time complexity. By transcending the constraints of traditional self-attention, FFTNet operates in the frequency domain, harnessing Parseval's theorem for energy preservation and long-range dependency capture. Adding to this high-efficiency mix is a learnable spectral filter and modReLU activation, which adaptively highlight key frequency components. Experimental results from well-known benchmarks like the Long Range Arena and ImageNet provide empirical support, showcasing FFTNet's edge over its predecessors. For those in the machine learning realm, this paper may well represent a paradigm shift—a more scalable pathway to managing long sequences and optimizing model performance. Check out the full paper for a deep dive into their methods and findings.

### Iterated Log Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://adamscherlis.github.io/blog/iterlog-coding/) | 107 points | by [snarkconjecture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=snarkconjecture) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43181610)

Adam Scherlis has unveiled a novel format for encoding real numbers, dubbed "iterated log encoding." This new approach offers a unique method for representing floating-point values on computers and claims to offer advantages in flexibility and precision over traditional fixed-point and floating-point systems.

In traditional fixed-point systems, numbers are stored with a single sign bit plus an absolute value; floating-point numbers work similarly to scientific notation using an exponent and significand. Logarithmic systems enhance upon this by reconstructing numbers as two entities: the logarithmic value and a separate sign bit. Symmetric level-index representations even facilitate encoding extremely large numbers through multiple logarithmic iterations.

The iterated log format revolutionizes these ideas by considering a number iteratively through its logarithms. The method interprets a number in stages: First determining general positivity or negativity, then evaluating the magnitude's logarithmic sign, and further assessing its subsequent logarithmic signs to refine precision. Each sign narrows the interval of possible values, allowing ultra-fine precision as more signs are added.

One quirk of this system is that it inadvertently mirrors Gray code, a sequence order where two successive numbers differ in only one bit, though it may not be the most practical for everyday coding. Through rigorous sign conversion and bit padding, the format achieves lexicographic ordering, handling zero and non-a-number (NaN) values in insightful ways.

With this format, a 7-bit depth becomes astonishingly powerful, able to represent an expansive range of numbers—large, small, or close to one—and showcasing unpredictable precision. This opens potential avenues in computer systems needing unusual numeric precision and range, offering symmetry across zero and an exciting non-uniform distribution of values. For enthusiasts and experts eager to delve into this, a prototype implementation is available with additional mathematical insights promised in upcoming posts.

The Hacker News discussion on Adam Scherlis' **iterated log encoding** method highlights technical debates, comparisons, and critiques. Here's a concise summary of key points:

### Key Themes:
1. **Comparisons to Existing Encodings**  
   - Users noted similarities to **Elias delta/omega coding** (for integer compression) and **Levenshtein coding** (variable-length integer encoding), sparking discussions on how iterated log encoding fits within existing frameworks.

2. **Practicality and Arithmetic Challenges**  
   - Concerns about computational efficiency arose:  
     - Arithmetic operations (e.g., addition/subtraction) are non-trivial in this format.  
     - Memory usage could grow rapidly (e.g., 16-bit numbers leading to 4GB storage needs).  
     - **Integer representation is inexact** (e.g., "3" decodes to ≈2.999999983422908 in 32-bit encoding).  
   - Multiplication was deemed simpler, but handling zero, infinity, and exact integers remains a challenge.

3. **Mathematical Connections**  
   - Links to **Dirac’s square-root-based number representation** were debated. Some users argued iterated log encoding resembles recursive exponentiation via square roots.  
   - The method’s log-depth precision was contrasted with Dirac’s approach, which requires exponential symbols for similar precision.

4. **Precision and Practical Use Cases**  
   - Non-uniform precision distribution (clustering near 0.5, 1.0) was noted as both a feature and limitation.  
   - Extreme range (e.g., 8 bits encoding numbers up to 2^2^65536) was praised theoretically but questioned for real-world applications.  
   - Suggested uses: **machine learning intermediate representations**, **compression algorithms** (e.g., DCT coefficients in JPEG-like codecs).

5. **Mixed Reactions**  
   - Praise for novelty and symmetry across positive/negative values.  
   - Skepticism about practicality: Existing systems (e.g., IEEE 754 floats) suffice for most needs, and the format’s complexity may limit adoption.  

### Notable Quotes:
- **On efficiency**: *"Addition/subtraction in log space isn’t straightforward."*  
- **On integers**: *"Exact integers don’t play nicely with this encoding."*  
- **On utility**: *"Does 2^2^65536 matter if Python can’t even compute it without choking?"*  

### Conclusion:  
The iterated log encoding is seen as a fascinating theoretical advance with niche potential (e.g., ML, compression), but practical challenges and competition from established systems like IEEE 754 temper enthusiasm. Its connections to mathematical concepts like Dirac’s methods add intellectual intrigue, yet real-world adoption hinges on solving arithmetic inefficiencies and precision quirks.

#### [Submission URL](https://medium.com/@aldendorosario/chatgpt-clicks-convert-6-8x-higher-than-google-organic-a457203cfc52) | 31 points | by [adorosario](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adorosario) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43177004)

In a fascinating dive into website traffic analytics, Alden Do Rosario has uncovered a significant discovery: while Google Organic traffic might outnumber that from ChatGPT, the quality of visitors driven by ChatGPT results in a staggering 6.8 times higher conversion rate for free trials. Using Google Analytics 4 (GA4) data from their site, customgpt.ai, the team discovered that although ChatGPT only contributed to 4% of the website's traffic, it accounted for a compelling 22% of conversions.

Historically, SEO strategies have focused on garnering clicks from Google's massive audience, under the assumption that more clicks translate to more conversions. However, Do Rosario's analysis suggests a paradigm shift: ChatGPT, with its high-intent and highly qualified leads, challenges the traditional focus on sheer volume.

What makes ChatGPT traffic so valuable? The study provides a detailed funnel breakdown, where ChatGPT outperforms Google Organic at every conversion stage—especially in the free trial segment, where users not only sign up but also provide a credit card, indicating serious purchasing intention. The study attributes this to possibly the conversational, context-driven nature of AI-generated search results.

For digital marketers and SEO experts, Do Rosario recommends paying close attention to ChatGPT traffic metrics within GA4 and considering optimization strategies to better capture and convert these high-quality leads. The traditional chase for raw numbers might soon make way for strategies that prioritize meaningful interactions leading to conversions. 

Finally, while recognizing the niche tech-oriented nature of their product, providing a potential conversion bias, Do Rosario advises businesses to explore this emerging dynamic, especially as AI-driven platforms begin to redefine the digital marketing landscape.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding the analysis of ChatGPT-driven traffic vs. Google Organic highlights several key arguments and debates:

### Key Takeaways:
1. **High-Intent ChatGPT Traffic**: Users agreed that ChatGPT’s traffic outperforms Google Organic in conversions (68x higher for free trials). This is attributed to ChatGPT’s ability to answer **specific, context-rich queries**, leading to users arriving on the site with clearer intent (e.g., pre-qualified leads likely to convert). A user noted that links shared via ChatGPT are *“pre-cooked”* within a relevant conversational context, filtering out low-intent clicks.

2. **Skepticism About ChatGPT’s Impact**: Some questioned the generalization of the findings, arguing that ChatGPT’s conversion rates might be **overstated** or niche-dependent. One critic pointed out that ChatGPT’s relevance is still limited compared to Google’s dominance, especially if Google improves spam filtering and result quality.

3. **SEO Implications**: Commenters debated whether this signals trouble for Google. A user speculated that as AI platforms like ChatGPT evolve, they may prioritize **direct answers over traditional links**, forcing SEO strategies to adapt. Others predicted businesses will optimize content for AI models to stay competitive.

4. **Data Tracking Challenges**: Technical concerns were raised about ChatGPT’s lack of **referral data** (e.g., no visitor stats or summaries), making it harder to measure traffic impact compared to Google Analytics. However, some argued metrics will improve as AI platforms introduce analytics tools.

5. **Short-Term vs. Long-Term Trends**: While critics dismissed the data as anecdotal or “fickle,” supporters countered that broader adoption of AI-driven search will validate the trend. One user emphasized that more websites will publish similar case studies soon, reinforcing the shift toward prioritizing quality over sheer traffic volume.

### Conclusion:
The discussion reflects a mix of enthusiasm for ChatGPT’s potential to disrupt SEO norms and skepticism about its scalability. While the high-conversion phenomenon is compelling, its long-term impact hinges on AI platforms’ transparency, evolving user behavior, and Google’s response to the competitive threat.

### The best way to use text embeddings portably is with Parquet and Polars

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/02/embeddings-parquet/) | 215 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43162995)

In today's headlines from Hacker News, we explore the fascinating application of text embeddings, a powerful outcome of the generative AI boom. A tech enthusiast has used embeddings to catalog every Magic: The Gathering card released as of the 2025 Aetherdrift expansion—a total of 32,254 cards. These embeddings, which transform text into numerical vectors, remarkably encapsulate the design and attributes of Magic cards, such as card names, texts, costs, and rarities, allowing for intriguing analyses and visualizations.

The project utilized the gte-modernbert-base embedding model to generate these vectors, creating a rich dataset that discovers similarities among the cards. For example, by applying a simple 2D UMAP projection, the cards naturally cluster by logical categories like color and type.

An interesting challenge this work highlights is how to effectively use and store embeddings. Many opt for vector databases, like faiss or Pinecone, though these can be cumbersome or costly. Instead, this project demonstrates the ability to perform similarity calculations without such databases, showcasing a fast and efficient method using NumPy, which requires minimal system memory and offers quick cosine similarity computations.

Storage efficiency emerges as another critical challenge. Traditional CSV files are bulky and inefficient for embedding storage, being significantly larger than necessary and adding serialization overhead. Instead, the article advocates using Parquet files, which offer a more elegant and portable solution, preserving data in a non-proprietary format that facilitates easier sharing and manipulation.

This innovative use of embeddings not only provides exciting insights into card designs but also sparks broader discussions on efficient data handling—crucial for advancing AI applications.

   - **LanceDB** and **DuckDB** are highlighted for bridging gaps: LanceDB supports dynamic updates/querying, while DuckDB integrates natively with Parquet and enables fast vector similarity searches (via new `vector` type extensions).  

2. **Performance & Tools:**  
   - **Polars** (Rust-based) is favored over Pandas for speed and lazy execution, especially with Parquet. Users note its ability to filter data efficiently (e.g., `pl.scan_parquet()`).  
   - **Vector Indexing**: Proposals like HNSW (hierarchical navigable small world) serialization in Parquet or standalone libraries (e.g., **USearch**, **FAISS**) are discussed for scalable vector search.  

3. **Challenges & Alternatives:**  
   - Columnar storage limitations: Parquet struggles with frequent updates, leading to workarounds like partition schemes or delta layers.  
   - Compact vector representations (e.g., **Vespa**’s binary encoding, **SimSIMD** kernels for optimized CPU/GPU operations) address payload size and speed.  
   - Structured vs. unstructured data: Debate persists on embedding JSON/text fields directly vs. restructuring inputs for semantic relevance (e.g., using **ModernBERT** to capture implicit structure).  

4. **Emerging Solutions:**  
   - Tools like **Unum’s Cloud** and **USearch** offer alternatives to FAISS, prioritizing SIMD optimizations and cross-language support.  
   - Hybrid approaches (e.g., Polars + Parquet + Ray for distributed workflows) balance portability and performance.  

**Takeaway**: The community leans toward *portable, open formats* (Parquet/SQLite) paired with optimized query engines (DuckDB, Polars) and lightweight indexing, avoiding vendor lock-in. Scalability concerns push interest in GPU acceleration and metadata-aware embeddings.

Google's new AI tool, Co-Scientist, is under the microscope as the initial buzz turns reflective. This tool, based on Google's Gemini LLM, was acclaimed after supposedly solving a long-standing scientific conundrum just days after being introduced to it. The AI suggested a hypothesis about drug-resistant bacteria, sparking excitement at Imperial College. However, the story's glow dimmed when it was revealed that Co-Scientist had a little head start — it had already "read" a 2023 paper by the same researchers which fleshed out the solution it put forth.

This isn't the first time Google's AI-powered marvels have been critiqued for overstated achievements. For example, Co-Scientist’s proposed drugs for liver fibrosis were already established candidates for that purpose. Similarly, DeepMind's claim of synthesizing new materials lost steam after later findings proved these materials weren't new.

José Penadés, involved in the bacterial project, acknowledged the AI's utility in collating disparate bits of information, but the notion of it being a pioneering scientific mind is perhaps, more dream than reality. The AI isn't conjuring new ideas out of thin air; it's piecing together existing knowledge—a great tool, but one that requires a pinch of scholarly restraint in its promoted capabilities.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion on Google's Co-Scientist AI:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward Google’s Co-Scientist AI, which was initially celebrated for solving a scientific problem but later criticized for relying on pre-existing research it had been trained on. Key themes include:

1. **Overhyped Claims**:  
   Users highlight a pattern of inflated AI achievements, citing Co-Scientist’s "breakthrough" (based on a 2023 paper by the same researchers) and prior examples like DeepMind’s overstated material synthesis. Critics argue such tools merely remix existing knowledge rather than generating novel insights, though some acknowledge their utility in synthesizing information.

2. **Token Predictors vs. Intelligence**:  
   A central debate questions whether large language models (LLMs) like Co-Scientist are merely sophisticated "token predictors" or capable of genuine reasoning. Technical explanations note that models like GPT optimize for next-token prediction, lacking true understanding or world interaction. Critics liken this to statistical pattern-matching, while defenders argue coherent outputs can still mimic reasoning.

3. **Human vs. AI Innovation**:  
   Comparisons to human cognition emerge: humans also build on prior knowledge but can generate novel ideas through real-world interaction and experimentation. LLMs, however, are confined to their training data, unable to form new hypotheses without external input. Some users suggest AI could evolve with reinforcement learning or sensory integration, but current systems fall short.

4. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**:  
   Discussions touch on the "deepity" of interpreting AI outputs as intelligent versus statistically plausible text. Skeptics warn against conflating fluency with insight, while others note that even human discoveries often arise from serendipity or incremental steps. The conversation underscores the need for tempered expectations, framing AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement in scientific research.

**Conclusion**:  
The consensus leans toward cautious pragmatism—Co-Scientist and similar tools are valuable for accelerating research but require transparency about their limitations. The hype around AI’s "revolutionary" potential risks overshadowing its role as an advanced assistant, not an autonomous innovator.

### OpenAI Researchers Find That AI Is Unable to Solve Most Coding Problems

OpenAI researchers have unveiled new insights into the world of AI coding capabilities, revealing that even the most advanced models are still no match for human software engineers. Despite CEO Sam Altman's confidence that AI will surpass "low-level" engineers by year-end, a recent study showcases these models' limitations. The developers utilized a benchmark called SWE-Lancer, which tested AI on over 1,400 tasks from Upwork, to evaluate the problem-solving capabilities of OpenAI's o1 and GPT-4o models, alongside Anthropic's Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

These AI tools were measured on their ability to tackle individual bug-fixing tasks and larger management tasks without internet assistance. Unfortunately, while the AI could handle surface-level issues swiftly, they struggled with identifying bugs in complex code or offering comprehensive solutions, and their superficial confidence often masked underlying inaccuracies.

Interestingly, Claude 3.5 Sonnet outperformed OpenAI's models financially, although it, too, frequently fell short. Researchers highlighted that for AI to reliably undertake real-life coding, models need significantly higher reliability.

As AI continues its rapid evolution, it still trails significantly behind the adept problem-solving skills of human engineers. Yet, there's a growing trend of companies betting on AI at the expense of human jobs, a notion underscored by recent discussions of automating Facebook coding jobs with AI.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on AI Coding Capabilities:**

The discussion revolves around mixed experiences and debates regarding the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and others in coding tasks. Key points include:

1. **Practical Use Cases and Limitations:**
   - Users reported **success with simple, repetitive tasks** (e.g., renaming variables, generating boilerplate code) but noted **struggles with complex logic, debugging, and context-specific issues**. For example, Claude quickly resolved an SQL syntax error for one user but failed to handle nuanced database dialect differences (e.g., Postgres vs. MySQL).
   - **Strongly typed languages like Elm and Haskell** posed challenges, as LLMs often generated incorrect code or cascading errors, requiring manual intervention. Some argued these languages’ strict compilers expose LLMs’ limitations in logical reasoning.

2. **Model Comparisons:**
   - **Claude 3.5 Sonnet** was praised for outperforming OpenAI models in certain SQL and BigQuery tasks, though inconsistencies remained. Users highlighted its ability to parse documentation and handle "hallucination" challenges better in some cases.
   - **GPT-4o** and others were seen as less reliable for complex code generation, with outputs often requiring significant manual correction.

3. **Debates on LLMs’ Role in AI Evolution:**
   - Some users viewed LLMs as a stepping stone toward general AI, while others dismissed them as overhyped tools lacking true understanding. Concerns were raised about their reliance on training data quality, with underrepresented domains (e.g., niche SQL dialects) leading to poor performance.
   - Financial implications were noted, with references to the $100B+ investments in AI and skepticism about whether scaling LLMs alone achieves "true" AGI.

4. **Impact on Developers:**
   - **Efficiency vs. Skill Erosion:** While LLMs speed up mundane tasks (e.g., searching APIs, drafting scripts), some worry they might hinder deep problem-solving skills. Users emphasized the enduring need for human judgment, especially in debugging and system design.
   - **Tooling Integration:** Suggestions included hybrid workflows combining LLMs with traditional research (e.g., RTFM) and dynamic systems that pull real-time context from documentation or tests.

5. **Frustrations and Workarounds:**
   - Users lamented **declining quality of traditional resources** (e.g., Google Search, Stack Overflow) and the need to "prompt engineer" LLMs heavily for useful outputs.
   - Mixed results were reported in edge cases, such as compiling niche systems (e.g., DeaDBeeF plugins), where LLMs occasionally offered surprising fixes but often fell short without precise context.

**Conclusion:** While LLMs are valued for accelerating certain coding tasks, the consensus is they remain unreliable for complex engineering challenges. Human expertise, critical thinking, and adaptability are still irreplaceable, particularly in nuanced or poorly documented scenarios. The discussion underscores a cautious optimism tempered by practical limitations.
