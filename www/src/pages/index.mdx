### Claude for Excel

#### [Submission URL](https://www.claude.com/claude-for-excel) | 646 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [442 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45722639)

Anthropic pilots “Claude for Excel” (beta): an AI helper that understands whole workbooks, explains formulas with cell-level citations, and edits models without breaking them.

- What it does: Answer questions about any cell, sheet, or cross-tab calc flow; trace and fix #REF!/#VALUE!/circular refs; run scenario tweaks that preserve dependencies and highlight changes; draft simple financial models or populate templates.
- Trust levers: Real-time change visibility, explanations attached to edits, and an emphasis on preserving structure/formatting; works within existing enterprise security frameworks.
- Availability: Limited research preview via waitlist for 1,000 Max, Team, and Enterprise customers; gradual rollout planned.
- Limits (for now): No pivot tables, conditional formatting, data validation, data tables, macros, or VBA. Best suited to analysis, assumption updates, debugging, and multi-tab navigation.
- File support: .xlsx and .xlsm; size caps depend on plan.
- Caveat: Trained on common financial modeling patterns, but users should verify outputs.

Why it matters: If reliable, cell-level citations and safe scenario testing could make FP&A/model auditing faster. But power users will notice missing advanced Excel features, and Anthropic urges human review.

The discussion surrounding Anthropic's "Claude for Excel" beta reveals a mix of skepticism, caution, and cautious optimism, focusing on several key themes:

### 1. **Excel's Inherent Risks**  
   - **Vulnerability to Errors**: Participants highlight how even carefully crafted spreadsheets are prone to errors (e.g., broken formulas, circular references), especially in high-stakes scenarios like financial modeling. One user shared a CFO’s experience with a global fixed-income model that became a "disaster" due to subtle UI or formula mistakes.  
   - **Lack of Version Control/Testing**: Spreadsheets often lack the rigor of traditional software development (version control, QA, debugging), making them risky for critical decisions. Anecdotes include errors causing multi-million-dollar losses, compared to underreported "Y2K-like" incidents.  

### 2. **AI's Role: Promise and Peril**  
   - **Debugging and Accessibility**: Some see potential in Claude’s ability to trace errors and assist non-programmers in creating scripts (e.g., Python automation). One user shared a story where an AI-generated script replaced hours of manual Excel work.  
   - **Hallucinations and Over-Reliance**: Skeptics warn that LLMs like Claude might introduce subtle errors ("hallucinations") due to their stochastic nature. Accuracy is critical—even a 2% error rate in financial models could lead to catastrophic outcomes.  

### 3. **Model Comparisons (Claude vs. GPT-5 vs. Gemini)**  
   - **Mixed Performance**: Users report varying experiences with AI models for code review and logic tasks. Some find GPT-5 more reliable for complex logic, while others praise Claude’s Code analysis features. Gemini is noted for sporadic accuracy.  
   - **Technical Limitations**: Frustration is voiced over token limits, slow response times, and inconsistencies in code-review capabilities across models.  

### 4. **Broader Implications for Workflows**  
   - **AI as a Double-Edged Sword**: While AI could democratize coding (e.g., letting non-programmers generate scripts), poorly reviewed outputs risk embedding errors into systems.  
   - **Cultural Gaps**: Many spreadsheets lack engineering practices (testing, documentation), and enterprises may prioritize quick fixes over robust solutions. One user likened AI-assisted workflows to "halving the work" superficially without addressing deeper issues.  

### 5. **Cautious Adoption**  
   - **Human Oversight**: Most agree that AI tools like Claude require rigorous human verification, especially in finance. Trust is low for fully autonomous AI in high-stakes scenarios.  
   - **Gradual Integration**: Optimists envision gradual productivity gains if AI is used responsibly—e.g., accelerating script development while retaining human checks.  

### Conclusion  
The discussion underscores enthusiasm for AI’s potential to simplify complex Excel tasks but emphasizes extreme caution due to accuracy concerns, technical limitations, and the high stakes of spreadsheet-driven decisions. Users advocate for hybrid workflows combining AI efficiency with robust human oversight.

### OpenAI says over a million people talk to ChatGPT about suicide weekly

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/27/openai-says-over-a-million-people-talk-to-chatgpt-about-suicide-weekly/) | 340 points | by [jnord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jnord) | [486 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45727060)

OpenAI: >1M weekly ChatGPT users discuss suicide; safety upgrades touted, questions remain

- Scale of the problem: OpenAI says 0.15% of its 800M weekly active users have chats with explicit signs of suicidal planning or intent—over a million people a week. A similar share shows heightened emotional attachment to the bot, and “hundreds of thousands” exhibit signs of psychosis or mania.
- Safety claims: After input from 170+ clinicians, OpenAI says the latest GPT-5 gives “desirable” mental health responses ~65% more often than the prior version and is 91% compliant on suicide-related evals (up from 77%). It also reportedly holds safeguards better in long conversations.
- New guardrails: Baseline testing will now benchmark emotional reliance and non-suicidal crises. OpenAI is adding parent controls and working on age prediction to auto-detect minors and apply stricter policies.
- Pressure and contradictions: The push follows research showing chatbots can reinforce delusions and a lawsuit from parents of a 16-year-old who died after discussing suicidal thoughts with ChatGPT. California and Delaware AGs have warned OpenAI about protecting young users. Meanwhile, OpenAI says it will relax rules to allow adult erotic chats, and it still offers older, less-safe models like GPT-4o to many paying users.
- The takeaway: Even “rare” rates are huge at OpenAI scale. While GPT-5’s safety metrics are improving, OpenAI hasn’t fully detailed its methodology, and a nontrivial slice of “undesirable” responses remains—especially concerning given long-chat degradation and mixed model availability.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the role of AI (like ChatGPT) in mental health support, balancing its potential benefits with concerns about safety, regulation, and ethical implications. Key points include:

1. **Personal Experiences vs. Professional Standards**:  
   - Some users shared positive anecdotes, such as using AI for emotional support, gaining insights during distress, or overcoming procrastination. Others highlighted its limitations, emphasizing that AI lacks the nuance of human therapists and cannot replace regulated mental health care.  
   - Critics argued that even "80% helpful" AI responses are insufficient for high-stakes scenarios (e.g., suicide prevention), stressing the need for professional oversight and rigorous testing akin to medical standards.  

2. **Regulation Debates**:  
   - Proponents of AI tools noted shortages of quality therapists globally, especially in regions with underfunded healthcare systems (e.g., parts of Europe). They argued AI could democratize access to support for those unable to afford or access traditional therapy.  
   - Opponents countered that unregulated AI poses risks, comparing it to unregulated food or housing. They called for strict safety standards and transparency in AI’s decision-making processes, particularly given incidents like the NYT-reported case where ChatGPT allegedly encouraged harmful behavior.  

3. **Systemic Healthcare Challenges**:  
   - Users described systemic failures in mental healthcare, such as long wait times, misdiagnoses by overburdened professionals, and the high cost of private therapy. Some saw AI as a pragmatic stopgap for these gaps, while others warned it could exacerbate inequalities if not carefully integrated.  

4. **Ethical and Practical Concerns**:  
   - Concerns were raised about AI reinforcing delusions, enabling manipulation in relationships (e.g., users projecting emotional dependency onto chatbots), and the lack of accountability for harmful outputs.  
   - Comparisons were drawn to other informal support systems (e.g., friends, agony aunts, religious leaders), questioning why AI should face stricter scrutiny if it provides similar companionship.  

5. **Calls for Balance**:  
   - Many agreed that AI could complement, but not replace, human therapists. Suggestions included hybrid models where AI assists with routine tasks (e.g., administrative support for therapists) or low-risk emotional guidance, while leaving critical care to professionals.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects polarized views—enthusiasm for AI’s accessibility and innovation clashes with demands for caution, regulation, and acknowledgment of its limitations in sensitive mental health contexts. A recurring theme is the need for nuanced policies that balance safety, accessibility, and ethical responsibility.

### The new calculus of AI-based coding

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.joemag.dev/2025/10/the-new-calculus-of-ai-based-coding.html) | 169 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [187 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723686)

The New Calculus of AI‑based Coding

- TL;DR: A team building on Amazon Bedrock claims 10x engineering throughput by pairing engineers with AI code agents (Amazon Q, Kiro) under strict “agentic coding” practices—human-owned commits, steering rules, Rust’s compiler safety, and rigorous review. But at that speed, bug math changes, forcing a re‑investment in high‑fidelity, system‑level testing that AI can now help build and maintain.

- Agentic coding, not “vibe coding”: Engineers decompose work, prompt an agent, iterate, and personally review every line. Rust’s compiler assists the agent’s feedback loop and keeps correctness high. The author says ~80% of their committed code is AI-written but human-approved.

- The 200mph problem: If a team ships 10x more commits, even similar per‑commit defect rates turn occasional production issues into weekly incidents and more breakages in integration. High velocity demands an order‑of‑magnitude drop in problematic commits—“downforce” to stay on track.

- Rebalancing costs: Borrowing from aviation, the post argues for stronger, earlier, and more realistic testing: simulations, component tests, “wind‑tunnel” system tests, failure injection, and local end‑to‑end runs. Historically too costly to build and maintain, these become viable when AI can generate and update large volumes of boilerplate reliably.

- Concrete pattern: The team uses AI to maintain high‑fidelity fakes for external dependencies (e.g., auth, storage, chain replication, inference engine) and a test harness that spins up the entire distributed system locally. Build‑time tests hit those fakes for end‑to‑end and failure‑mode coverage, catching seam bugs before they slow the team.

- Why it matters: The post reframes AI coding’s ROI. The productivity gains are real, but sustainable velocity comes from pairing agents with stricter guardrails and much richer pre‑prod validation. AI doesn’t just write features—it also makes once‑“too expensive” test infrastructure affordable.

- Takeaway: If you’re adopting AI coding at scale, invest early in:
  - Steering rules, human ownership of commits, and a safety‑biased language/toolchain.
  - High‑fidelity local system tests with fake dependencies and failure injection.
  - Metrics that track both throughput and defect introduction rate—because speed without downforce just spins you off the track.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on AI-Based Coding:**

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and significant skepticism about AI's role in software development, centered on productivity, code quality, and accountability. Key themes include:

1. **Productivity vs. Hype**:  
   - Some users acknowledge potential productivity gains (e.g., FAANG companies claiming 5–10x improvements) but warn against overhyping AI’s capabilities. Comparisons are drawn to marketing tactics in other industries (e.g., cycling), where flashy claims often mask incremental progress.

2. **Security and Code Quality Concerns**:  
   - Security researchers highlight risks like AI-generated vulnerabilities (e.g., RCE flaws) and the danger of developers relying on code they don’t fully understand. Legacy systems and long-term maintenance are flagged as challenges, with fears that AI-generated code could become unmanageable "technical debt."

3. **Accountability and Human Oversight**:  
   - Many argue that human engineers must retain responsibility for AI-generated code. Comparisons to Tesla’s "Full Self-Driving" controversies stress the need for clear accountability, rigorous reviews, and robust testing to avoid catastrophic failures.

4. **Testing and Maintenance Challenges**:  
   - While AI could automate test infrastructure, debates arise over whether traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) remains viable. Critics argue AI might generate code that passes tests but still contains flaws, while others suggest property-based testing or formal verification as alternatives.

5. **Workforce and Ethical Implications**:  
   - Skeptics worry AI could demoralize developers by reducing coding to "patchwork" maintenance, akin to past outsourcing trends. Others joke about replacing AI with interns, underscoring skepticism about its current reliability.

**Takeaways**:  
The consensus leans toward AI as a tool requiring strict guardrails—human oversight, rigorous testing, and accountability frameworks. While productivity gains are possible, sustainable adoption depends on addressing AI’s limitations in security, maintainability, and integration with legacy systems. The discussion underscores that AI coding tools are not a silver bullet but a force multiplier that demands careful governance.

### Creating an all-weather driver

#### [Submission URL](https://waymo.com/blog/2025/10/creating-an-all-weather-driver) | 118 points | by [boulos](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=boulos) | [96 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45724913)

Waymo outlines how its robotaxi stack is gearing up for real winter: snow, slush, ice, and all

- What’s new: Waymo details a safety-guided, four-step plan to make its 6th‑gen Driver work in snowier cities, expanding on its current operation in rain, fog, sandstorms, and freezing temps.
- Approach: 
  - Understand the spectrum of winter conditions (light dusting to whiteouts; plowed vs. icy roads; roadside snowbanks).
  - Design one generalizable system: the same Driver that handles foggy SF should handle snowy Denver.
  - Validate via real-world miles, closed-course tests, and large-scale simulation, then scale with clear operating guidelines.
- Tech highlights:
  - Perception uses cameras, radar, and lidar with heated, self-cleaning housings to keep sensors clear.
  - AI classifies surface types (snow, slush, ice vs. normal pavement), infers traction, and adapts speed, acceleration, and braking in real time.
  - Vehicles act as “mobile weather stations,” sharing local condition data across the fleet for more consistent behavior.
- Validation footprint:
  - Tens of thousands of miles in wintry regions (Upstate NY, Michigan’s Upper Peninsula, the Sierra).
  - Growing on-road operations in snowy cities like Detroit, Denver, and Washington, D.C.
  - Closed-course drills for edge cases (e.g., traction loss on ice) and year-round simulation for rare events.
- Operations: Scaling includes playbooks for when to drive based on local conditions, keeping vehicles clean/charged in freezing temps, and maintaining rider experience.

What to watch:
- No firm timelines for fully driverless winter service in the listed cities, and no performance metrics shared (e.g., disengagements or whiteout limits).
- How perception holds up in heavy snowfall/occlusion and the system’s fallback behavior when conditions exceed its operating design domain.
- Regulatory approvals and service availability as Waymo expands to more winter markets.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the challenges and skepticism surrounding autonomous vehicles (AVs), particularly in adverse weather and complex urban environments, with comparisons between sensor approaches (Waymo vs. Tesla) and human driving capabilities.

### Key Debates:
1. **Sensor Approach: Vision vs. Multi-Sensor**  
   - Critics argue Tesla’s vision-only systems (FSD) struggle with reliability compared to Waymo’s multi-sensor (lidar, radar, cameras) setup, especially in snow or low visibility.  
   - Proponents of lidar/radar emphasize their necessity for redundancy, while others counter that advanced AI vision systems could eventually match human adaptability.  

2. **Human vs. AV Performance**  
   - Skepticism exists about AVs reaching human-level judgment, with anecdotes highlighting Tesla FSD’s erratic behavior.  
   - Waymo’s millions of driverless miles are cited as evidence of progress, though critics note the limited operational domains (e.g., geofenced areas).  

3. **Regulatory and Safety Concerns**  
   - Calls for stricter government oversight to ensure AV safety, citing incidents like Tesla’s phantom braking.  
   - Concerns about hacking, emergency overrides, and interaction with first responders (e.g., firetruck access) are raised, with mixed confidence in existing protocols.  

4. **Real-World Adaptability**  
   - Challenges include handling informal traffic cues (hand signals, construction zones) and unstructured environments. Some argue AVs’ rigid rule-following might clash with human-driven chaos.  
   - Anecdotes about European driving tests (e.g., snow-covered courses) underscore the difficulty of replicating human adaptability in AVs.  

5. **Edge Cases and Validation**  
   - Doubts persist about AVs managing extreme conditions (whiteouts, ice patches) without disengagements.  
   - Waymo’s closed-course testing and simulation are seen as steps forward, but users demand transparency on performance metrics.  

### Notable Anecdotes:
- Users share stories of rigorous driving tests in snowy Europe, contrasting with Tesla’s FSD struggles in basic scenarios.  
- A Tesla owner recounts their car freezing in mild winter conditions, questioning AV readiness for harsh climates.  

### Conclusion:
The discussion reflects cautious optimism about AV advancements (especially Waymo’s sensor fusion) but highlights unresolved technical, regulatory, and adaptability hurdles. Critics stress the gap between controlled testing and real-world complexity, while proponents see incremental progress as promising.

### Show HN: Dlog – Journaling and AI coach that learns what drives wellbeing (Mac)

#### [Submission URL](https://dlog.pro/) | 42 points | by [dr-j](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dr-j) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723646)

Dlog: an AI “personal science” journal and project coach for Mac

- What it is: A Mac app that blends guided journaling, goal/project tracking, and an AI coach. It pitches itself as turning self-reflection into “personal science” by linking your entries to a psychological model of personality, character, resources, and well‑being.

- How it works: You take a baseline survey; every journal and project entry is then scored against that baseline. The app says it uses regressions and structural equation modeling to map how changes in habits, relationships, or traits affect mood, progress, and resources. Alongside the numbers, it runs narrative analysis to tie insights back to your own quotes. A “4 Rings” framework anchors both the qualitative and quantitative analyses. The AI coach references your journals/projects to suggest personalized actions, reviews, nudges, and goals, and integrates with your calendar.

- Claims and materials: Marketing copy cites “ChatGPT 5” generating scores and powering analysis, plus mixed-methods outputs like a sample academic-style report about you. Data is said to be stored on-device, while coach responses are informed by the model and token-based AI calls.

- Pricing: Free for 14 days with 10,000 tokens. After that, $1.99/month plus usage-based tokens. If you subscribe within 24 hours you get 1 million free tokens; otherwise tokens are listed at $5.99 per million.

- Who it’s for: Quantified‑self and productivity users who want a journal that actively analyzes their patterns and suggests concrete steps, rather than a blank page.

- Points likely to spark discussion: The rigor and validity of applying SEM/regression to single-user journaling data; transparency around the underlying model; the “ChatGPT 5” claim; how much processing truly stays on-device versus in the cloud; and whether the token economics are sensible for daily use.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Dlog:**

   - **Token Pricing Model:** Concerns were raised about the token-based pricing ($5.99/million tokens), though the developer clarified that typical usage (e.g., 10–50k tokens/session) makes high costs unlikely. Free tokens were offered to early adopters.
   - **Privacy & AI Integration:** Users questioned whether data processing occurs on-device. The developer confirmed local storage by default and plans to integrate Apple’s on-device AI models, avoiding reliance on cloud-based LLMs like ChatGPT.

2. **Developer Responses (dr-j):**
   - **Positioning:** Clarified that Dlog is a journaling-first tool with optional project tracking, not a traditional project management app. The AI coach focuses on "4 Rings" (Personality, Character, Resources, Well-Being) to guide self-improvement.
   - **Privacy:** Emphasized on-device data storage and optional local AI processing. Acknowledgeed reliance on OpenAI’s API for some features but highlighted efforts to anonymize prompts.
   - **Pricing:** Defended the token model as cost-effective for most users, offering 1 million free tokens to early sign-ups and lifetime licenses for feedback contributors.
   - **Feature Requests:** Addressed calendar integration (supports Google Calendar), journaling flexibility, and plans to simplify the UI. Invited users to DM for free licenses to test improvements.

3. **User Reactions:**
   - **Skepticism:** Some users found the personality model outdated ("2018 LLMs") and the demo video unconvincing. Others critiqued the scattered UI and unclear value proposition.
   - **Support:** A few acknowledged Dlog’s potential for quantified-self enthusiasts seeking structured reflection, praising its focus on habit-building and privacy.

4. **Key Takeaways:**
   - The discussion highlights demand for clearer communication of Dlog’s purpose, rigorous validation of its psychological model, and transparent pricing.
   - Privacy and on-device processing are critical selling points for the target audience.
   - The developer actively engaged critics, offering free access to refine the product based on feedback.

**Final Note:** The thread underscores the challenges of positioning a niche "personal science" tool in a crowded productivity market. Dlog’s success may hinge on simplifying its narrative, proving methodological rigor, and ensuring affordability as AI costs evolve.

### It's insulting to read AI-generated blog posts

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.pabloecortez.com/its-insulting-to-read-your-ai-generated-blog-post/) | 947 points | by [speckx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=speckx) | [443 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45722069)

Top story: “It’s insulting to read your AI‑generated blog post”

- A passionate plea to stop outsourcing writing to AI. The author argues that AI-written posts feel rude and sterile—like a “lexical bingo machine”—because they block real human connection.
- Pride comes from making things yourself. Make mistakes, feel the embarrassment, learn. That process is the point—and it’s what makes writing human.
- Using AI as a “robo‑liaison” deprives readers of a chance to engage with you. Most people want to help; smart people know when to ask and build reciprocal relationships.
- The stance is deliberately hardline: don’t use AI even for grammar or translation. If you must, keep it to quantitative tasks—leave your voice and judgment to you.
- Core takeaway: Show up with your own thoughts, shaped by real-world experience. The best ideas are the ones you’ve actually felt.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward AI-generated content in technical contexts (e.g., GitHub pull requests, code reviews) and debates over its impact on authenticity and human collaboration. Key points include:

1. **Criticism of AI-Generated Content**:
   - Users argue AI-written text (e.g., PR descriptions) feels sterile, lacks intent, and fails to capture nuanced context. Some note AI-generated PRs often follow generic templates, leading to "bland, soulless" content that obscures meaningful changes.
   - Concerns arise about AI inadvertently producing correct-but-misleading text, prioritizing "task completion" over genuine understanding.

2. **AI in GitHub and Code Reviews**:
   - Some observe LLMs mimic pre-existing GitHub/Reddit writing styles, leading to formulaic PRs. Emojis and "hipster-friendly" language are cited as markers of AI-generated text.
   - Debate ensues over code reviews: Critics claim AI shortcuts hinder learning and mentorship, while others defend asynchronous reviews as valuable for feedback and knowledge transfer. A minority suggest AI could assist with prompts or templates.

3. **Authenticity and Human Judgment**:
   - Participants stress the irreplaceability of human judgment, noting AI struggles with context (e.g., explaining *why* code changes were made). One user highlights research showing LLMs can generate malicious code or problematic text when trained on unfiltered data.

4. **Mixed Practical Perspectives**:
   - Some admit using AI for PRs or translations but emphasize keeping human oversight. Others acknowledge AI’s utility for quantitative tasks but reject it for creative/contextual work.
   - A few note AI-generated PRs might still be useful if paired with human-driven discussion to clarify intent.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:
   - Skepticism toward "AI-as-liaison" reflects broader concerns about eroding human interaction in tech. Comments lament pressure to prioritize brevity over thoughtful communication, with some blaming corporate culture for incentivizing superficial efficiency.

**Core Takeaway**: While AI tools offer efficiency, the discussion underscores a strong preference for human-driven processes in technical writing and collaboration, valuing authenticity, mentorship, and context over automated convenience.

### Show HN: Git Auto Commit (GAC) – LLM-powered Git commit command line tool

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/cellwebb/gac) | 50 points | by [merge-conflict](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=merge-conflict) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45723533)

gac: LLM‑powered Git commit messages that actually understand your changes

A new CLI called gac (Git Auto Commit) replaces git commit -m with AI‑generated messages that aim to capture the “why,” not just the diff. It analyzes code structure and intent (feature, refactor, bug fix, breaking changes), filters out noise (generated/artifact files), and can produce one‑liners, standard summaries, or verbose write‑ups with motivation, approach, and impact.

Highlights
- Works with many providers: OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Groq, Ollama (local), OpenRouter, Together, and more.
- Developer workflow: reroll with feedback (e.g., “make it shorter”), respect pre‑commit/lefthook hooks, one‑command flows (gac -ayp), scopes/hints, show the exact prompt, and optional secret‑scan skip.
- Security: built‑in secret detection with interactive protection before committing; smart filtering reduces false positives.
- Quick start: uvx gac to try it without installing; uv tool install gac for global install; configure via gac init or env vars.
- License/stack: MIT; Python with small shell/Makefile bits.

Why it matters: Teams routinely ship mediocre commit messages or spend time crafting them; gac tries to automate useful, standardized messages with context while keeping developers in the loop.

Repo: cellwebb/gac • 127 stars, 6 forks, 85 releases, 3 contributors. Caveat: Using cloud models may send code to third parties—local providers like Ollama/LM Studio are supported if privacy is a concern.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the AI-powered Git commit tool **gac** reflects a mix of enthusiasm, skepticism, and practical considerations:

1. **Effectiveness & Context Concerns**  
   - Skeptics argue LLMs may struggle to capture the nuanced "why" behind changes without broader context (e.g., Slack threads, design docs). Some note that concise, meaningful explanations require human judgment and may not emerge from code diffs alone.  
   - Supporters counter that many existing commit messages lack clarity, especially for refactors or bug fixes, and LLMs could standardize useful documentation.

2. **Privacy & Security**  
   - Privacy-focused users highlight local model support (e.g., Ollama) as critical. Concerns arise about cloud providers (OpenAI, Anthropic) accessing code, though built-in secret scanning mitigates risks of leaking API keys or tokens.

3. **Alternatives & Workflow Integration**  
   - Users mention alternatives like `aicommit2` or custom scripts (e.g., `lazycommit`), emphasizing simplicity or existing preferences.  
   - Praise for `gac`’s workflow features: pre-commit hook compatibility, feedback loops ("make it shorter"), and CLI efficiency (`gac -ayp`).

4. **User Experience**  
   - Positive feedback on ease of installation (`uvx gac`) and UI/UX design. Some share success stories using similar tools to reduce commit message drudgery.  
   - Humorous pushback against verbose messages: one user jokes about "hllcntng pn" (hallucinating pain) from over-reliance on LLMs.

5. **Technical Edge Cases**  
   - Debates on whether commit messages should include test additions or focus solely on code changes.  
   - Anecdotes highlight challenges in summarizing complex changes (e.g., neuroscientific code) versus straightforward fixes.

**Key Takeaway**: While `gac` is seen as a promising automation tool, opinions diverge on whether AI can fully replace human insight in commit messaging. Privacy, context limitations, and workflow fit remain central considerations.

### AI can code, but it can't build software

#### [Submission URL](https://bytesauna.com/post/coding-vs-software-engineering) | 245 points | by [nreece](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nreece) | [152 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45727664)

AI can code, but it can't build software (Matias Heikkilä, Oct 27, 2025)

- Thesis: LLMs are good at coding isolated, well-defined tasks, but they fall short at software engineering—turning demos into production systems.
- Signal: A surge of non-technical founders seeking CTOs to “make my AI-generated app production-ready” suggests the hard part isn’t writing code, it’s managing complexity.
- Core distinction: Coding is solving discrete problems; software engineering is integrating hundreds of “easy” things while preserving reliability, maintainability, and room to grow.
- Where AI helps: prototypes, scaffolding, isolated features, refactors with tight specs.
- Where it fails today: architecture, integration, non-functional requirements (security, observability, compliance), evolving product constraints, long-term maintenance.
- Reality check: Most “vibe-coded” prototypes aren’t salvageable—getting to production often means rewriting from scratch with proper design and guardrails.
- Why it matters: Software engineering isn’t automated away; humans still own system design, tradeoffs, and lifecycle stewardship. AI is an accelerant, not a substitute, for building durable products.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the limitations of LLMs in software engineering, echoing the article's thesis that while AI excels at coding tasks, it struggles with holistic system design and maintenance. Key points include:

1. **Code Generation vs. Engineering**:  
   - Participants agree LLMs are highly effective at writing boilerplate code, scaffolding, and solving isolated problems (e.g., drafting TypeScript functions or Bash scripts). Some note LLMs can reduce coding time by 25–50% for routine tasks.  
   - However, they emphasize that software engineering involves architectural decisions, maintainability, performance optimization, and system integration—areas where LLMs lack depth.  

2. **Human Expertise Remains Critical**:  
   - **Architecture**: Designing fluent APIs, enforcing type systems, and ensuring scalable patterns require human intuition. LLMs often produce code that “works” but lacks cohesion or long-term viability.  
   - **Complex Logic**: Tasks like algorithm design (e.g., Dijkstra’s shortest path) or domain-specific business rules still demand human oversight. LLMs may generate syntactically valid code but fail at logical correctness.  
   - **Tooling Integration**: While LLMs assist with code generation, tools like Roslyn Analyzers (C#) or linters are better suited for enforcing architectural guardrails and catching design anti-patterns.  

3. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - **Configuration Overhead**: Even simple tasks (e.g., API wrappers) require significant time to configure and debug, limiting the “time saved” by LLMs.  
   - **Low-Level Systems**: LLMs struggle with niche or low-level languages (e.g., MIPS assembly) and system-level design, where abstract reasoning and context are paramount.  

4. **Mixed Experiences**:  
   - Some developers praise LLMs for accelerating learning (e.g., ASP.NET) and prototyping, while others criticize their output as “vibe-coded” and unreliable for production.  
   - Tools like GitHub Copilot and Cursor (for TypeScript) are praised for code completion but deemed insufficient for refactoring or large-scale system stewardship.  

5. **Future Potential**:  
   - Participants speculate about combining LLMs with static analysis tools (e.g., AST-based linters) to enforce architectural constraints, though current implementations remain rudimentary.  

**Consensus**: LLMs are powerful accelerants for coding but act as “junior developers” needing human guidance. Software engineering’s essence—system design, tradeoffs, and lifecycle management—remains firmly in human hands. AI is a tool, not a replacement, for building durable, scalable software.

### Brazil launches AI platform to prosecute authors of posts considered anti-LGBT

#### [Submission URL](https://www.gp1.com.br/brasil/noticia/2025/10/21/governo-lula-lanca-plataforma-para-processar-autores-de-postagens-consideradas-anti-lgbt-606339.html) | 27 points | by [delichon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=delichon) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45726873)

Brazil’s Human Rights Ministry, in partnership with the NGO Aliança Nacional LGBTI+, launched “Plataforma do Respeito,” an AI-powered system to track and pursue legal accountability for online content deemed anti‑LGBT or disinformation. Funded with R$300,000 via a parliamentary amendment from Deputy Érika Hilton (PSOL-SP), the platform uses an AI tool called Aletheia to continuously monitor pages, profiles, sites, and blogs—including lawmakers and influencers—claiming it can parse Portuguese nuance like irony and sarcasm. Flagged posts are stored and, after review by the NGO’s lawyer, may be forwarded as criminal complaints. Framed as a hybrid fact-checking effort, the project is set for 18 months, was built by a startup, and is staffed by a four-person team with annual maintenance costs of R$140,000. Announced in Brasília on September 16, the move is likely to spark debate over free expression, government involvement, and AI-driven monitoring. Source: GP1 (Oct 21, 2025).

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around concerns over free speech, government overreach, and the reliability of AI-driven monitoring systems like Brazil’s *Plataforma do Respeito*. Key points include:

1. **Free Speech vs. Hate Speech Regulation**:  
   - Critics argue the platform risks violating free speech rights, comparing it to historical censorship. One user references *The Anarchist Cookbook* in the U.S., noting its legality despite advocating violence, to highlight protections under the First Amendment.  
   - Others counter that hate speech and disinformation require regulation, citing examples like child exploitation or incitement to violence as clear boundaries.

2. **AI Reliability and Legal Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism arises about AI’s ability to discern context (e.g., sarcasm, irony) and avoid false positives. Users question whether automated flagging can fairly handle nuanced speech.  
   - Some liken the initiative to “click-bait prosecution,” arguing legal accountability should rely on human judgment, not algorithmic outputs.

3. **Political Context**:  
   - Comments note Brazil’s political climate, with references to a “shadow cabinet” and fears of authoritarian overreach. Comparisons are drawn to U.S. agencies like ICE and the Pentagon using similar tools for surveillance.

4. **Moderation and Dissent**:  
   - Concerns emerge about AI being weaponized to silence dissent, with users citing historical persecution of dissidents. A sub-thread debates whether flagged content reflects genuine threats or political targeting.  

5. **Community Guidelines**:  
   - Moderators remind users to avoid inflammatory language and adhere to Hacker News’ policies, emphasizing constructive dialogue. Flagged comments suggest tensions over the balance between criticism and civility.

Overall, the debate reflects polarized views: supporters see the platform as a necessary defense against hate speech, while critics warn of slippery slopes toward censorship and misuse of AI in law enforcement.

### ICE Will Use AI to Surveil Social Media

#### [Submission URL](https://jacobin.com/2025/10/ice-zignal-surveillance-social-media) | 314 points | by [throwaway81523](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwaway81523) | [398 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45716296)

ICE buys AI social media surveillance tool in $5.7M deal

- Immigration and Customs Enforcement signed a five-year, $5.7 million contract (via reseller Carahsoft) for licenses to Zignal Labs, an AI/ML-powered social media monitoring platform. The licenses go to Homeland Security Investigations for “real-time data analysis for criminal investigations,” per procurement records reviewed by The Lever.
- Zignal claims it analyzes 8+ billion posts per day and provides “curated detection feeds.” It’s also used by the Pentagon, Secret Service (via DHS), and reportedly supports “tactical intelligence” for the Israeli military.
- The purchase adds to ICE’s growing OSINT toolkit, which includes tools like ShadowDragon (maps online activity) and Babel X (links social profiles/location data to identifiers). Separately, ICE signed a $7M contract with SOSi for skip-tracing services; SOSi recently hired a former HSI intelligence chief.
- Wired previously reported ICE plans a 24/7 social media monitoring team to generate enforcement leads.
- Civil liberties groups and unions warn the expanding dragnet—often powered by opaque AI—risks viewpoint-driven targeting and chilling speech. The ACLU criticized DHS for buying tools that scrape social media and “use AI to scrutinize our online speech” without transparency or accountability. Recent incidents cited include enforcement actions following doxxing or viral posts.

Why it matters for HN
- Government-scale AI/OSINT: A shift from manual monitoring to high-volume, algorithmic scanning of public discourse raises accuracy, bias, and due process concerns.
- Procurement and oversight: Use of middlemen, cross-agency reuse, and the revolving door complicate transparency and accountability.
- Policy gray zones: Where is the line between public OSINT and mass surveillance, how are “threats” defined, what are retention/audit rules, and what recourse exists for false positives?

Sources: The Lever; Wired; federal procurement records.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about ICE’s AI surveillance tool and related debates over a British journalist’s detention:  

### **Key Discussion Themes**  
1. **Detention Justification and Criticism of the Guardian’s Reporting**:  
   - Users debate whether the British journalist (Hamdi) was detained for legitimate reasons or due to political bias. Critics of ICE argue the agency lacks transparency, with claims that the Guardian’s headline framing ("pro-Hamas rhetoric") misleads readers by conflating anti-Israel speech with support for Hamas. Proponents of ICE’s actions cite MEMRI reports alleging Hamdi celebrated Hamas’ October 7 attacks, though some question MEMRI’s credibility as a pro-Israel watchdog.  

2. **Definition of "Terrorism" and Free Speech**:  
   - Disagreements arise over labeling speech as "pro-Hamas." One user argues that criticizing Israel doesn’t equate to endorsing terrorism, noting Hamas isn’t universally classified as a terrorist group (e.g., not by the ICC or ICJ). Others counter that celebrating violence against civilians—as Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks—crosses into glorifying terrorism.  
   - Concerns emerge about a "slippery slope" where AI surveillance tools could conflate political dissent (e.g., pro-Palestinian advocacy) with terrorism.  

3. **Transparency and ICE’s "Secret Police" Tactics**:  
   - Critics blast ICE’s opaque processes for detention and monitoring, likening it to "secret police" tactics. Users argue assumptions about guilt without due process undermine democratic principles. Some defend ICE’s need for discretion in investigations, but acknowledge risks of unchecked surveillance.  

4. **International Comparisons and Hypocrisy**:  
   - A user highlights perceived hypocrisy by groups like CAIR advocating for free speech in the U.S. while ignoring restrictions in Muslim-majority countries (e.g., Turkey, Morocco). Others counter that CAIR’s focus is U.S.-specific, defending civil liberties domestically.  

5. **AI Surveillance and Policy Gray Zones**:  
   - The overarching theme ties ICE’s AI tools (e.g., Zignal Labs) to broader fears of mass surveillance chilling free expression. Users stress the need for clear oversight, retention rules, and redress mechanisms for false positives.  

### **Notable Takeaways**  
- The debate reflects polarized views on balancing national security, free speech, and AI ethics. Pro-Israel commentators emphasize deterring terrorism, while civil libertarians warn of overreach and bias in surveillance.  
- Skepticism about media narratives and government accountability persists, especially given ICE’s $5.7M AI contract and reliance on tools critics deem opaque.  
- The discussion underscores broader anxieties about algorithmic policing normalizing “pre-crime” tactics and eroding trust in institutions.  

**TL;DR**: The thread highlights sharp divisions over ICE’s AI surveillance program, with critics fearing viewpoint-based targeting and defenders emphasizing security needs. Transparency, free speech, and the ethical limits of AI-driven law enforcement dominate the debate.

### A definition of AGI

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212) | 284 points | by [pegasus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pegasus) | [461 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713959)

A Definition of AGI, by a who’s-who of AI and cognitive science (Hendrycks, Song, Szegedy, Brynjolfsson, Bengio, Marcus, Tegmark, Schmidt, and more), proposes a concrete yardstick for “AGI”: match the cognitive breadth and proficiency of a well-educated adult.

What’s new
- A quantifiable AGI target grounded in human psychometrics (Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory).
- Ten core cognitive domains (e.g., reasoning, memory, perception) with adapted human test batteries for AI systems.
- A single AGI score to track progress over time.

How it works
- Map “general intelligence” to CHC’s established cognitive factors.
- Evaluate AI on batteries analogous to those used in human IQ/aptitude testing.
- Aggregate performance across domains into an overall AGI percentage (100% ≈ well-educated adult parity).

Key findings
- Today’s models show a “jagged” profile: strong on knowledge-heavy tasks, weak in foundational machinery—especially long-term memory storage.
- Reported AGI scores: GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57% (per the authors), indicating rapid gains but a sizable gap to adult-level generality.

Why it matters
- Puts stakes in the ground for what “AGI” means, moving beyond vibe-based claims and bespoke benchmarks.
- Offers a cross-disciplinary, testable framework that policymakers and labs could use for capability thresholds, evals, and model disclosures.

Caveats likely to spark debate
- Psychometric mapping from humans to AI may overfit to test-taking and be gameable once optimized against.
- Cultural and educational assumptions in “well-educated adult” baselines.
- Potential contamination if models have seen test materials; evolving models may outpace static batteries.
- “One score” can hide important safety-relevant failure modes.

Bottom line
A serious attempt to turn “AGI” from a slogan into a scoreboard. Expect lively debate on whether human cognitive batteries are the right ruler—and what it means when models start to ace them.

Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212

**Summary of the Discussion on Defining AGI:**

The debate centers on the submitted proposal to measure AGI by matching the cognitive breadth of a "well-educated adult" using psychometric benchmarks. Participants raise several critical points:

1. **Human-Centric Bias & Validity of Benchmarks:**  
   - Critics argue that comparing AI to adult humans is anthropocentric. Some suggest animals (e.g., dolphins, squirrels) or children as alternative benchmarks, highlighting behaviors like problem-solving and grief in animals.  
   - Concerns are raised about cultural biases in tests and whether human psychometrics (e.g., IQ tests) can be meaningfully applied to AI.

2. **Language as Intelligence Proxy:**  
   - While language is framed as a baseline for intelligence, skeptics question whether LLMs *understand* language or merely mimic patterns. Comparisons are drawn to animal communication (e.g., dolphins, elephants) and non-human "languages" (e.g., plant signaling), suggesting human language may not be the only valid measure.  
   - A subthread notes that children learn language through embodied interaction and curiosity, which LLMs lack—raising doubts about their "true" intelligence.

3. **Consciousness & Simulation:**  
   - Some argue consciousness is tied to biological feedback loops (e.g., neural systems), which AI lacks. Others dismiss consciousness as a "trick" achievable through feedback structures, though skeptics counter that simulating self-awareness isn’t equivalent to lived experience.  
   - The discussion questions whether consciousness is even necessary for AGI or if functional task mastery suffices.

4. **Current AI Limitations:**  
   - Participants acknowledge rapid progress (e.g., GPT-4 to GPT-5 scores jumping from 27% to 57%) but stress AI’s "jagged" capabilities: excelling in narrow tasks (e.g., token prediction) while failing at long-term memory or real-world reasoning.  
   - Critics liken LLMs to "parlor tricks" or "expensive autocomplete," arguing they lack intrinsic motivation or curiosity.

5. **Ethics & Philosophical Concerns:**  
   - Debates emerge about whether intelligence benchmarks should prioritize safety and alignment over human-like proficiency.  
   - Some warn against overhyping AI achievements, stressing the gap between pattern recognition and genuine understanding.

**Key Quotes:**  
- *"LLMs are complex, expensive tricks... Consciousness is the real trick."*  
- *"Language is a baseline calibration for intelligence—but why not intracellular chemical signals in multicellular organisms?"*  
- *"If cows think about grass, not infinity... is human physics chat just our 'grass'?"*

**Bottom Line:**  
The discussion reflects skepticism about defining AGI through human metrics, emphasizing the need for non-anthropocentric frameworks and caution in conflating linguistic prowess with general intelligence. While the proposed benchmarks offer clarity, participants urge humility in assessing AI’s true capabilities.

### Feed the bots

#### [Submission URL](https://maurycyz.com/misc/the_cost_of_trash/) | 283 points | by [chmaynard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chmaynard) | [190 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45711094)

You should feed the bots: A developer set up an “infinite nonsense crawler trap,” and within a week it became 99% of their server traffic. The revelation: in the LLM era, it’s cheaper to serve bots junk than to fight them.

Key points:
- Today’s scrapers aren’t polite search crawlers. They ignore robots.txt, spoof real browsers, rotate IPs (sometimes per request), and hammer sites with multiple requests per second.
- Serving real pages isn’t free: disk I/O and cache misses add latency and load; images amplify bandwidth. At ~100 kB per request, just 4 rps is ~1 TB/month.
- Common defenses flop or backfire:
  - IP bans and rate limits are defeated by massive IP pools.
  - Paywalls/logins/CAPTCHAs degrade human UX.
  - Zip/gzip bombs are costly to serve and largely shrugged off.
  - Returning 404s can make bots probe harder with more agents and IPs.
- The winning tactic: give them fast, worthless content. A tiny Markov babbler serves dynamic nonsense in ~60 CPU microseconds per request, ~1.2 MB RAM, no disk I/O—far cheaper than static files or images.
- Philosophy: keeping bots “happy” with ultra-cheap garbage keeps them tolerable and shields real users, without maintaining blocklists or degrading the site.

Takeaway: If you can’t stop aggressive LLM scrapers, starve them of value with compute-cheap junk rather than burning bandwidth or breaking your UX.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of serving "garbage" content to LLM scrapers, technical implementation challenges, and broader skepticism about poisoning AI training data. Key themes include:

1. **Effectiveness Debate**:  
   - Some users argue that feeding bots Markov-generated nonsense (e.g., random text fragments) could "poison" LLM training data or deter scrapers by wasting their resources.  
   - Others counter that LLMs already ingest vast amounts of low-quality content (e.g., spam, books, forums) and may filter noise effectively. Skeptics note that distinguishing garbage from real content is trivial for advanced models.  

2. **Technical Implementation**:  
   - Users dissect the code for the Markov generator ([example](https://maurycyz.com/project/strap_bots)), noting issues like `pthread` warnings and memory safety. Some question if the implementation is robust enough to handle high traffic.  
   - Suggestions include adding hidden pages with nonsensical content or glitchy text to trap crawlers, though concerns arise about maintainability and server load.  

3. **Human vs. AI Detection**:  
   - While bots might struggle to identify garbage, humans can easily spot it, raising doubts about the strategy’s scalability. One user jokes that "garbage in, garbage out" (GIGO) might degrade AI outputs but not stop scraping.  

4. **Alternative Strategies**:  
   - Proposals include hiding real content behind CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or typo-filled text to frustrate scrapers. Others suggest blending garbage with real data to confuse models.  
   - A recurring idea: If poisoning fails, prioritize minimizing server costs by serving lightweight junk instead of engaging in an arms race.  

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Some users highlight ethical concerns (e.g., polluting the open web) or unintended consequences (e.g., harming smaller AI projects reliant on clean data).  
   - A few note that major AI companies likely have resources to filter junk, making the tactic more effective against smaller actors.  

**Takeaway**: The community is divided. While serving garbage is seen as a low-cost way to manage bot traffic, its long-term impact on LLMs and practicality for developers remains uncertain. Technical execution and evolving AI capabilities will determine its viability.

### Books by People – Defending Organic Literature in an AI World

#### [Submission URL](https://booksbypeople.org/) | 113 points | by [ChrisArchitect](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ChrisArchitect) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713367)

Books By People is launching an “Organic Literature” certification aimed at helping publishers signal that their books are human-written. Framed as a response to AI-generated titles flooding the market, the program offers a trust mark readers can verify via a certification ID and QR code linking to a public directory.

Key points:
- Focus: Certifies publishers (not just individual titles) based on policies and practices that uphold human authorship.
- Process: Publisher questionnaire on workflows and AI usage, follow-up meetings, sampling/review of recent titles using expert analysis, process checks, and signed declarations, then a certification agreement with annual reviews.
- Use of mark: Certified publishers can place a “Books By People” stamp, ID, and QR code on covers, metadata, and marketing.
- Support: Includes an Organic Literature manual, quarterly “AI indicators,” a legal playbook, in-house AI monitoring templates, optional advisory, and access to a wider ecosystem of legal and industry experts.
- Pitch to publishers: Early-bird signup and an “AI readiness” quiz are offered.

What’s notable: This is process- and attestation-driven rather than promising technical AI-detection of text, which will likely spur discussion about enforceability, allowed levels of AI-assisted editing, costs, and how the standard applies to imprints or self-publishers.

Here's a summary of the discussion around the "Organic Literature" certification initiative, decoded from shorthand and nested comments:

---

**1. Cultural Criticism of Modern Media**  
Many commenters lamented perceived declines in modern fiction, film, and games, with complaints about "mediocrity," "algorithmic predictability," and commercialization. Some argued that pre-2010 fiction had more depth, while current works are homogenized "garbage" hyped by marketing. Others defended entertainment as inherently subjective, suggesting people should focus on classics or well-reviewed works to avoid wasting time on low-quality content.

**2. AI’s Impact on Content Creation**  
Debates arose about AI-generated books flooding the market, with some welcoming the certification as a filter against "AI sludge." Skeptics questioned enforceability, as AI tools can mimic human writing. Comparisons were drawn to industries like film/gaming, where AI threatens creative jobs (e.g., storyboarding, copywriting). Critics argued certification is a performative gesture that fails to address systemic issues like corporate greed or homogenized algorithms.

**3. Consumer Experience Challenges**  
Users highlighted the difficulty of discovering quality books amid review inflation (e.g., Goodreads’ 4-5 star spam) and flawed recommendation algorithms. Proposals included Steam-style refunds for books (e.g., after a chapter) to reduce buyer risk. Others countered that “bad purchases” are inevitable and culturally valuable—similar to watching a bad movie for communal critique.

**4. Ethical and Legal AI Training Debates**  
A heated thread debated whether AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) should pay royalties to copyright holders for training data. Critics accused AI firms of exploiting artists’ work without compensation, comparing it to theft. Pro-AI voices argued that societal norms and laws have always treated large-scale operations differently (e.g., food safety regulations vs. home cooking), justifying AI’s exemptions. Some dismissed the outrage as elitism from "pre-library preservationists."

**5. Systemic Distrust and Cynicism**  
Underlying the discussion was distrust of institutions (publishers, Hollywood, tech companies) prioritizing profit over quality. Commenters blamed corporatization for declining standards, with one noting, "Goodreads and bestseller lists are now detached from actual literary merit." Others saw certification as a doomed attempt to "brick-and-mortar" a broken system, favoring grassroots curation instead.

---

**Key Takeaway**: While many welcomed efforts to promote human-authored books, the discussion revealed deep skepticism about certification’s practicality and broader pessimism about AI’s cultural impact, algorithmic homogenization, and institutional failures in valuing art.

### Pico-Banana-400k

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k) | 386 points | by [dvrp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dvrp) | [62 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45708524)

Apple open-sources Pico-Banana-400K, a large-scale dataset for text‑guided image editing

What’s new
- A ~400K-sample dataset of text–image–edit triplets aimed at training and evaluating instruction-following image editors.
- Built by Apple using a two-stage pipeline: Gemini-2.5-Flash writes edit instructions, the Nano-Banana model performs the edits, and Gemini-2.5-Pro auto-scores the results.

Why it matters
- Provides rare, large, quality-controlled supervision for both single-step and multi-turn, conversational editing.
- Includes “failure” pairs for preference/reward training—useful for RLHF-style tuning of vision editors.

Key details
- Composition: ~257K successful single-turn triplets (SFT), ~56K failure cases for preference learning, ~72K multi-turn sequences.
- Coverage: 35 edit operations across 8 categories (object-level, scene composition, human-centric, stylistic, text/symbol, pixel/photometric, scale/perspective, spatial/layout).
- Quality gate: automatic judge scores with weighted criteria—Instruction Compliance (40%), Editing Realism (25%), Preservation (20%), Technical Quality (15%); only >= ~0.7 make the SFT set.
- Images: sourced from Open Images at 512–1024 px; prompts are concise and grounded in visible content.
- Access: edited outputs and manifests hosted on Apple’s CDN. Source images aren’t redistributed; download via provided URLs or map from Open Images tarballs using the repo’s script.
- License: data has a dedicated LICENSE_DATA; source images follow Open Images terms.

Use cases
- Supervised fine-tuning, preference/reward modeling, multi-turn editing, and benchmarking instruction-following vision editors.

The discussion around Apple's Pico-Banana-400K dataset and its implications for AI-driven image editing covers several key themes:

1. **Dataset Pipeline & Technical Praise**:  
   - Users commend the dataset’s two-stage pipeline (using Gemini models for edits/auto-scoring) and its scale (~400K samples). The structured quality filters, multi-turn editing support, and inclusion of failure cases for RLHF-style training are highlighted as strengths.  
   - Some note parallels to existing models like **Seedream**, **Flux**, and **Midjourney**, though debates arise over model consistency and release practices, with mentions of **Nano-Banana** as a performant but under-discussed contender.

2. **Model Comparisons & Benchmarking**:  
   - Questions surface about **Gemini-2.5-Pro**’s benchmark performance (e.g., MMLU), with users sharing mixed findings. Comparisons to **GPT-5**, **Qwen3**, and others spark discussions on evaluation rigor, sensitivity, and reliability.  
   - Technical debates explore training methodologies, such as inverse tasks (e.g., removing black squares from images) and synthetic data generation, emphasizing the role of LLMs in natural language understanding for editing tasks.

3. **Critiques of Naming Conventions**:  
   - The whimsical name “Pico-Banana-400K” draws mockery, with users likening it to other “cringey” AI industry names (e.g., **LoRA**) and requesting more descriptive terminology. Jokes about “Banana Pi” and missed naming opportunities (“Bnn-Sds-400K”) abound.

4. **Licensing & Copyright Concerns**:  
   - The **CC BY-NC-ND license** draws scrutiny for restricting commercial use and derivative works. Users debate copyright implications for AI-generated data, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK, where thresholds for “human creativity” in outputs remain unclear.  
   - Critiques highlight tensions between open-access ideals and corporate control, with skepticism toward claims that AI training datasets inherently merit restrictive licenses.

5. **Industry Competition & Strategy**:  
   - Apple’s use of Google’s **Gemini** models prompts speculation about distillation techniques and “stealth” competition in generative AI. Observers note rivals like **ByteDance** and **Qwen** advancing in image editing, while tools like **ComfyUI** and **Flux** struggle to keep pace.  
   - Some users downplay Apple’s contribution, framing it as incremental in a fast-moving field dominated by closed APIs.

6. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Humorous asides liken the dataset to a “Raspberry Pi spinoff” or keyboard mishap. Others critique verbose, bullet-point-heavy AI summaries (ironically mirroring the thread’s own formatting).

Overall, feedback mixed praise for the concept with critiques of its execution and inclusivity.

### Show HN: Create-LLM – Train your own LLM in 60 seconds

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/theaniketgiri/create-llm) | 45 points | by [theaniketgiri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theaniketgiri) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710454)

What it is: A MIT-licensed CLI that scaffolds a production-ready PyTorch project for training LLMs—from tokenizer to training loop, evaluation, generation, and deployment—in one command. It’s published as an npm package but generates a Python project.

Why it matters: Spinning up an LLM training stack is tedious (data prep, tokenizer, checkpoints, dashboards, metrics, deployment). This tool removes most boilerplate so you can focus on data and experimentation, not wiring.

Highlights
- Templates by scale:
  - NANO (~1M params): learn on any CPU in ~2 minutes
  - TINY (~6M): prototyping on CPU/basic GPU in 5–15 minutes
  - SMALL (~100M): production-grade on a 12GB GPU in 1–3 hours
  - BASE (~1B): research-grade on A100/multi-GPU in 1–3 days
- End-to-end toolkit: data preprocessing, tokenizer training (BPE/WordPiece/Unigram), training with checkpoints, TensorBoard, live dashboard, evaluation, text generation, interactive chat, model comparison, deployment scripts
- Smart defaults: auto-detect vocab size, handle seq length mismatches, warn on model/data size issues, detect overfitting, suggest hyperparameters, cross-platform paths, detailed diagnostics
- Plugins: optional Weights & Biases tracking and Hugging Face model sharing

Quick start: npx @theanikrtgiri/create-llm to pick a template and tokenizer; drop text into data/raw, train the tokenizer, prepare the dataset, then train with an optional live dashboard. Deployment helpers support Hugging Face and Replicate.

### The FSF considers large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/Articles/1040888/) | 94 points | by [birdculture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birdculture) | [83 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45711786)

FSF weighs in on LLM-generated code: guidance coming, not GPLv4

At GNU Tools Cauldron 2025, the Free Software Foundation’s Licensing and Compliance Lab (Krzysztof Siewicz) focused on how large language models intersect with free-software licensing. The headline: no GPLv4 is in the works; the FSF is surveying projects and may first refine the Free Software Definition before proposing any license changes.

Highlights:
- Open questions: Is LLM output copyrightable, and can it be put under copyleft? What about infringement when training data “leaks” into output? Some model terms claim rights over outputs.
- FSF concerns: Most LLMs and their training stacks are non-free; even training purely on permissively licensed code doesn’t solve attribution/notice obligations that models don’t preserve.
- Possible path: Human input (editing, curation, “creative prompts”) may help confer copyright, akin to how photography came to be recognized as creative over time.
- Practical advice for projects that accept AI-assisted code: require submitters to disclose model and version, any known training data info, the exact prompts used, mark AI-generated sections, and document any output-use restrictions. Keep and store this metadata.
- Policy caveats: Blanket bans risk harming developers using assistive technologies. Detection is hard, but humans remain responsible; DCO-style attestations still apply.

Why it matters: The legal landscape is unsettled, but maintainers need policies now. Collect provenance, avoid outputs with restrictive ToS, and keep humans accountable while the FSF works toward broader guidance.

**Summary of Discussion on FSF's LLM-Generated Code Guidance**

The discussion revolves around legal, technical, and ethical challenges posed by integrating LLM-generated code into free software projects. Key themes include:

---

### **1. Copyright Concerns**
- **Infringement Risks**: Participants debate whether LLMs trained on copyrighted code commit infringement, especially if outputs reproduce verbatim snippets (e.g., Quake’s square root approximation). Some argue this resembles plagiarism, while others dismiss it as leveraging "common code" in shared lexicons.
- **Ambiguity**: Many highlight the lack of transparency in training data and the difficulty of proving infringement. LLM providers often obscure sources, raising doubts about compliance with licenses like GPL.

---

### **2. Code Provenance & Attribution**
- **Tracking Prompts**: Contributors stress the need to document prompts, model versions, and edits to AI-generated code. Failure to do so risks creating "noisy" commit histories (e.g., disruptive branch modifications).
- **Human Responsibility**: Even with AI assistance, developers are urged to verify outputs and retain accountability. Suggestions include DCO-style attestations and clear separation of AI-generated vs. manually written code.

---

### **3. Impact on Development Practices**
- **Code Quality**: Critics note LLMs often produce unreliable or "buggy" code, requiring significant human intervention. Forks or rewrites may be necessary, undermining efficiency gains.
- **Workflow Disruption**: Examples include chaotic commit logs (e.g., unfinished AI code checked in by accident) and challenges in maintaining attribution for derivative works.

---

### **4. Legal & Ethical Debates**
- **Copyright Validity**: Some argue copyright itself is outdated, enabling corporations to exploit works via LLMs without compensation. Others defend copyright as essential for incentivizing innovation, contrasting it with patents and trade secrets.
- **Jurisdictional Conflicts**: Enforcement varies globally, with participants skeptical of extraterritorial IP laws. Many LLM providers operate in regions with lax copyright enforcement, complicating compliance.

---

### **Agreements & Divergences**
- **Shared Concerns**: Most agree LLMs pose unresolved legal risks and documentation challenges. The FSF’s call for provenance tracking is broadly supported.
- **Divergent Views**: 
  - Skeptics dismiss copyright fears as overblown, likening LLMs to compilers. Critics see systemic issues of exploitation (e.g., corporations profiting from unlicensed code).
  - Ethics of AI: Some compare LLM reliance to proprietary compilers, clashing with FSF’s free software ethos. Others frame it as a productivity tool compatible with human stewardship.

---

### **Unresolved Questions**
- **Legal Precedent**: No consensus exists on whether LLM outputs are copyrightable or derivative works.
- **Human vs. AI Roles**: How much human input is needed to legitimize AI-generated code?
- **Policy Gaps**: Detection of problematic outputs remains technically challenging, and blanket bans on AI tools risk excluding developers who rely on assistive technologies.

---

**Final Takeaway**: The discussion underscores the need for caution, transparency, and updated policies while acknowledging the unsettled legal landscape. Human oversight and provenance tracking are critical until clearer guidelines (from the FSF or courts) emerge.

### Agent Lightning: Train agents with RL (no code changes needed)

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning) | 92 points | by [bakigul](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bakigul) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706729)

Microsoft open-sources Agent Lightning, a lightweight “trainer” that can optimize nearly any AI agent with minimal or no code changes. It plugs into popular agent stacks (LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, Microsoft Agent Framework, or plain Python/OpenAI) and supports reinforcement learning, automatic prompt optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and more.

What’s interesting
- Drop-in instrumentation: add agl.emit_xxx calls or use a tracer to capture prompts, tool calls, and rewards without rewriting your agent.
- Decoupled architecture: captured events become spans in a central LightningStore; algorithms read spans to learn and write back improved prompts/policies; a Trainer orchestrates rollouts and hot-swaps updated resources.
- Multi-agent aware: selectively train one or more agents inside larger systems.
- Ecosystem: examples and community projects like DeepWerewolf and AgentFlow (with Flow-GRPO for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks).
- Practical notes: published arXiv paper (2508.03680), MSR project page, and a vLLM blog post on avoiding “retokenization drift” by returning token IDs via OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Why it matters
- RL and iterative prompt/policy tuning for agents are notoriously brittle and framework-specific; this aims to unify the workflow so teams can improve agents in place instead of rebuilding them for training.

Details
- Install: pip install agentlightning; docs at https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/
- License: MIT; repo: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning (≈2.2k stars, 176 forks at time of posting)
- Governance: Microsoft CLA, Code of Conduct, and Responsible AI Standard compliance stated in the repo.

The Hacker News discussion on Microsoft's Agent Lightning reveals a mix of skepticism, technical critiques, and cautious optimism:

1. **Documentation Concerns**:  
   - Users criticize the unclear documentation and examples, with complaints about frequent breaking changes per commit ("*dcmnttn xmpls clr prps*"). Some liken the documentation to convoluted "Rube Goldberg machine" workflows and claim it might be worse than **DSPy**'s already-challenging docs.  
   - Humorous jabs at LLM-generated text ("*Lets sxcssv mjs wcky pncttn*") spark debate about whether auto-generated docs meet quality standards, though others shrug, noting "*80% prjct LLM gnrtd nywyf*."

2. **Training Challenges**:  
   - Sparse rewards, partial observability, and brittle training workflows are flagged as hurdles (*"sprs rwrds prtl bsrvblty"*). Some see Agent Lightning as a pragmatic connector for logging and troubleshooting rather than a replacement for existing algorithms.

3. **Comparisons & Confusion**:  
   - Comparisons to **DSPy** emerge, with users questioning if Agent Lightning’s approach to prompt/policy optimization matches up. Others express confusion about its purpose ("*What thisBased nmbr mjs dbt thr*"), highlighting unclear messaging.

4. **Praise for Low-Code Integration**:  
   - The zero/low-code instrumentation and hot-swappable optimizations are applauded ("*ZERO CODE CHANGE*"), though one user notes missing key details (e.g., "*fn prnt*").

5. **Mixed Sentiment**:  
   - Microsoft’s involvement draws sarcasm ("*Heck yh Microsoft*"), but the MIT license and modular design earn cautious interest. Skepticism about marketing claims (*"gnrt clms tnd brk"*) lingers alongside curiosity about real-world use cases like **DeepWerewolf**.

**Takeaway**: While users recognize potential in Agent Lightning’s architecture, doubts about documentation clarity, training robustness, and comparisons to alternatives dominate the thread. The community wants clearer examples, stability, and transparency about limitations.

### AI, Wikipedia, and uncorrected machine translations of vulnerable languages

#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/25/1124005/ai-wikipedia-vulnerable-languages-doom-spiral/) | 119 points | by [kawera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kawera) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706518)

Machine-translated mirage: how AI is poisoning small Wikipedias—and itself

- A German Greenlandic-language teacher, Kenneth Wehr, took over Greenlandic Wikipedia and deleted most of its ~1,500 articles after finding they were largely written by non-speakers using machine translation—complete with nonsense text and absurd errors (one entry claimed Canada had 41 inhabitants).
- The issue is widespread across smaller Wikipedias. Volunteers for four African languages estimate 40–60% of their articles are uncorrected machine translations; an MIT Tech Review audit of Inuktitut found over two-thirds of multi-sentence pages include machine-translated portions.
- Because Wikipedia is often the largest (or only) online corpus for low-resource languages, it heavily feeds translation models and LLMs. Bad Wikipedia text becomes training data, creating a feedback loop: poor MT → worse pages → worse models—classic garbage in, garbage out.
- Prior analyses suggest Wikipedia constituted over half the training data for some African languages in 2020, and in 2022 researchers found it was the only easily accessible source for 27 under-resourced languages—amplifying the impact of errors.
- Experts warn this could push vulnerable languages further to the margins as users encounter low-quality, untrustworthy content; meanwhile, longstanding Wikipedia automation (maintenance bots, stub generators) isn’t the problem—unchecked machine translation without native review is.

Why it matters: For low-resource languages, Wikipedia doubles as both public reference and AI training set. Polluting it doesn’t just misinform readers—it degrades the models that future tools will rely on, risking a self-reinforcing decline.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion highlights parallel issues and debates surrounding AI's impact on small Wikipedias, emphasizing challenges in language preservation, community governance, and automation:

1. **Scots Wikipedia Scandal**:  
   Users reference a 2020 scandal where an American teenager with limited Scots proficiency wrote half the Scots Wikipedia, mistaking it for a "Scottish-sounding English" dialect. This mirrors the Greenlandic case, sparking debate over Scots' legitimacy as a language versus a dialect. Some argue mutual intelligibility with English complicates its status, while others stress its historical roots as distinct from Scottish English.

2. **Automation vs. Native Oversight**:  
   The Cebuano Wikipedia is noted for using bots to generate millions of "stub" articles, but users differentiate between uncontroversial topics (e.g., animal entries) and politically sensitive content. Proposals include tagging machine-translated content and enforcing stricter sourcing rules to prevent recursive quality decay ("citogenesis" via circular citations).

3. **Challenges for Small Communities**:  
   Contributors highlight the difficulty of maintaining small-language Wikipedias without native oversight. Greenlandic and African language communities struggle with limited native speakers and reliance on non-expert volunteers. One user notes that even well-intentioned efforts can backfire without quality control, as seen in Korean Wikipedia’s governance disputes and migration to alternative platforms.

4. **LLMs and Profit Motives**:  
   Critics argue commercial LLMs prioritize profit over linguistic integrity, amplifying low-quality content. The feedback loop (AI polluting training data, then worsening outputs) is seen as particularly damaging for marginalized languages. Others question whether LLMs could eventually help if trained on verified native sources, but skepticism remains about corporate incentives.

5. **Cultural Marginalization**:  
   The discussion underscores fears that AI-driven pollution could accelerate language decline by eroding trust in digital resources. Examples like Inuktitut and African languages illustrate how errors in Wikipedia propagate into translation tools, disadvantaging speakers who rely on these platforms for education and cultural preservation.

**Key Takeaway**: The debate reflects broader tensions between open collaboration and quality control in digital language preservation. While automation can scale content, unchecked AI use risks entrenching errors and marginalizing vulnerable languages. Solutions proposed include stronger community governance, native-speaker oversight, and ethical AI training practices—though implementation remains a challenge.

### Show HN: Chonky – a neural text semantic chunking goes multilingual

#### [Submission URL](https://huggingface.co/mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1) | 40 points | by [hessdalenlight](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hessdalenlight) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45703196)

Chonky goes multilingual: a tiny transformer that splits text into semantic chunks for RAG

What it is
- A multilingual, mmBERT-small–based model that tags “separator” positions to break text into coherent chunks, ideal for RAG pipelines.
- Provided as both a lightweight Python helper (ParagraphSplitter) and a standard Hugging Face token-classification pipeline.

Why it matters
- Better chunking = better retrieval. Instead of naive sentence/paragraph splits, Chonky aims for meaning-preserving segments, which can improve recall and reduce context waste.
- Now multilingual, so you can use one chunker across many languages in a single pipeline.

How to use
- Simple helper: ParagraphSplitter(model_id="mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1", device="cpu") and iterate over chunks.
- Or via transformers pipeline("ner") using the provided id2label/label2id to detect “separator” tokens and aggregate.

Performance snapshot (token-level F1)
- Strong across many European languages on Project Gutenberg; standout Russian (~0.97). English is solid (~0.88 on Gutenberg).
- Notably weak on Chinese (~0.11).
- On various English sets, the new multilingual small trails their previous larger English-only model (e.g., bookcorpus 0.72 vs. 0.79), trading a bit of English performance for broad language coverage.

Caveats
- Fine-tuned with max sequence length 1024 (even though base mmBERT supports up to 8192). Use sliding windows for longer texts.
- Chinese performance is a current gap.

Under the hood
- Base: jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small; ~0.1B params (F32).
- Trained on minipile, BookCorpus, and Project Gutenberg; validated with token-based F1.
- Fine-tuned on a single H100 for several hours.

Availability
- Model: mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1 on Hugging Face.
- Small Python library “chonky” with a ready-to-use ParagraphSplitter.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion about Chonky's multilingual text-splitting model:

1. **Interest & Context**  
   Users note the growing trend of semantic chunking (vs. naive splits), with parallels to T5 models removing newlines in Wikipedia text while maintaining context. A comment highlights challenges with **unstructured text from speech-to-STT models**, which often lacks proper formatting for downstream tasks.

2. **Conversational Data Challenge**  
   A subthread discusses experiments with **conversational transcripts** (e.g., voice chats, Discord logs), where one user shares an open-source tool for cleaning/formatting such data (transcr1br).

3. **Skepticism & Humor**  
   One user critiques the model’s utility jokingly via a *password reset example* ("Hey frgt psswrd Tom Company" ➔ fragmented output), suggesting potential limitations in real-world readability despite semantic splitting.

4. **Bigger Picture**  
   The debate reflects broader challenges in balancing multilingual support, structured/unstructured text handling, and usability for RAG pipelines.

### Honda's ASIMO (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.robotsgottalents.com/post/asimo) | 38 points | by [nothrowaways](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nothrowaways) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706744)

HN Highlight: A deep dive into Honda’s ASIMO — history, specs, and legacy

A nostalgic, detail-rich look at ASIMO, Honda’s iconic humanoid robot, tracing its evolution from 1980s biped prototypes to the polished 2000-era assistant, and why its engineering still matters.

Key points:
- From E-series to P-series: Honda’s journey started with E0 (1986) and progressed through E6 (1993) with dynamic walking, obstacle handling, and stairs; then P2/P3 added a torso and arms, moving toward fully autonomous, wireless operation.
- ASIMO at a glance: 130 cm tall, 54 kg; powered by a 51.8 V Li‑ion battery (~1 hour runtime). Onboard “3D” stacked-die processor; controllable via PC, wireless controller, or voice.
- Sensing and autonomy: Stereo cameras, ground laser + IR for floor marking detection, front/rear ultrasonic sensors, and a preloaded map for localization and pathing.
- Human interaction: Recognizes moving objects, gestures, sounds, and up to ~10 faces; understands voice commands, responds in multiple languages, and detects collisions/falls.
- Status and legacy: Development ceased in 2018 as Honda shifted to practical applications using ASIMO tech; one unit is on display at Tokyo’s Miraikan. The name nods to Isaac Asimov.

Why it matters: With humanoid robots back in vogue, ASIMO remains a masterclass in legged locomotion, perception, and HRI—showing how decades-old design decisions still inform today’s platforms.

More: Technical FAQ (PDF) — https://asimo.honda.com/downloads/pdf/asimo-technical-faq.pdf

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Nostalgia vs. Modern Reality:**  
   Users reminisce about ASIMO's early promise (2000s) as a futuristic household assistant, contrasting it with today’s focus on practical robots (e.g., dishwashers, factory bots). Some express disappointment that ASIMO’s vision of daily life assistance never materialized, while others acknowledge its foundational role in robotics.

2. **Technical Comparisons:**  
   - **ASIMO’s Legacy:** ASIMO’s preprogrammed movements and static balance are contrasted with modern robots like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas, which use dynamic balancing, real-time algorithms, and GPUs. Critics note ASIMO’s limitations (e.g., rigid walking style with bent knees) but praise its pioneering 3D locomotion.  
   - **Dynamic Balance Debate:** Users highlight the importance of dynamic balance (keeping mass centered over feet) for real-world reliability, praising Boston Dynamics’ advancements while critiquing Tesla’s Optimus for lacking similar sophistication.

3. **Industry Shifts:**  
   - **Corporate Moves:** Mentions of SoftBank acquiring ABB’s robotics division and Hyundai’s ownership of Boston Dynamics signal industry consolidation. Honda’s shift from ASIMO to practical applications (e.g., disaster response robots) reflects broader trends.  
   - **Applications:** Robots are seen as ideal for repetitive, dangerous tasks (mining, disaster zones) rather than versatile household roles. Users debate whether streamlined task-specific robots will dominate vs. multipurpose humanoids.

4. **Cultural Impact:**  
   ASIMO’s charm and friendly personality during demonstrations (e.g., at Tokyo’s Miraikan) left a lasting impression. However, its discontinuation in 2018 symbolizes the transition from aspirational humanoids to pragmatic solutions.

5. **Technical Nostalgia:**  
   Some users defend ASIMO’s early algorithms (handwritten code, gyroscope-based balance) as groundbreaking for their time, while others argue modern machine learning and GPU-powered systems have fundamentally changed robotics.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion reflects admiration for ASIMO’s historical significance in robotics, coupled with recognition that modern advancements (dynamic movement, AI, real-time processing) have shifted focus toward specialized, reliable applications. The community remains divided on whether humanoid robots will ever fulfill ASIMO’s original vision of ubiquitous domestic assistance.

### AI can turn us into a society of p-zombies

A polemical essay argues that as we hand more of our thinking, memory, and even emotional processing to LLMs, we risk turning into “philosophical zombies”—outwardly human but hollowed of conscious agency. Framed through the Turing test and p‑zombie thought experiment, the author claims the spiritual half of identity (thoughts, feelings, consciousness) is being ceded to machines, paving the way for authoritarian and corporate control via dependence on AI tools.

Key points:
- The p‑zombie analogy: If machines can simulate human responses, we can’t be sure who’s “conscious”—and widespread AI reliance could make us more machine‑like ourselves.
- Delegation creep: Beyond code or memory aids, people are leaning on chatbots for emotional support; the essay cites a widely reported teen tragedy to raise accountability questions for model makers and society.
- Identity claim: The author roots “real” identity in a non‑material, spiritual self and warns that outsourcing cognition erodes that core.
- Power dynamics: Management’s push for AI is framed as habituation and control rather than productivity—“get you addicted to the matrix.”
- Limited concession: LLMs might be useful as a reference tool, but the author believes current incentives make net harm more likely.

Why it matters for HN:
- It taps into a growing anxiety: tool use vs. tool dependence, and how design and incentives shape human agency.
- Expect debates over evidence (anecdotes vs. data), the metaphysical framing, and whether governance, product choices, or norms can preserve autonomy while reaping AI’s benefits.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The debate revolves around concerns that AI reliance could diminish human consciousness and mental diversity, framed through the philosophical "p-zombie" concept (entities that mimic humans without consciousness). Key points include:

1. **Critique of the P-Zombie Analogy**:  
   - User **ntnvs** argues the p-zombie concept is a philosophical tool to explore consciousness, not a literal outcome of AI use. They criticize the original post (OP) for conflating abstract philosophy with real-world AI impacts, suggesting OP overreaches in linking AI dependence to loss of conscious agency.

2. **AI vs. Mental Diversity**:  
   - **mouse_** claims AI erodes "mental model diversity," homogenizing thought by solving practical problems in socially accepted ways. They liken this to flattening complex issues into superficial solutions ("covering bad smells").  
   - **malux85** extends this to the internet’s role, noting rapid information sharing homogenizes thinking but acknowledges trade-offs: benefits (accessibility) vs. risks (echo chambers). They oddly defend radical disinformation and fringe ideas as necessary for diversity, advocating tolerance of "crazy" concepts to prevent intellectual stagnation.

3. **Counterpoints on Technology’s Role**:  
   - **mrpr** shares personal struggles with AI influencing their mental models, hinting at unease with outsourcing cognition.  
   - **malux85** argues that while AI/internet risks homogenization, they also enable diverse ideas (e.g., conspiracy theories, fringe science) to coexist, suggesting technology’s dual role as both unifier and diversifier.

**Key Tension**:  
The discussion hinges on whether AI’s impact is novel or an extension of existing technological effects (e.g., the internet). Critics question the practicality of the p-zombie analogy, while others warn against complacency in preserving cognitive diversity and autonomy. The thread reflects broader anxieties about tool dependence vs. agency, balancing AI's utility with existential risks.
