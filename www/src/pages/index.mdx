### The deep link equating math proofs and computer programs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/the-deep-link-equating-math-proofs-and-computer-programs-20231011/) | 238 points | by [digital55](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=digital55) | [142 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37845195)

The Curry-Howard correspondence, also known as the Curry-Howard isomorphism, is a profound revelation that links mathematical proofs and computer programs. It posits that concepts from computer science (types and programs) are equivalent to propositions and proofs from logic. This means that writing a program is not just "coding," but an act of proving a theorem. The correspondence was independently discovered by Haskell Curry and William Alvin Howard in the 1930s and 1960s, respectively. They noticed the similarity between functions in mathematics and the implication relationship in logic. When a computer program runs, each line is evaluated to yield a single output, much like simplifying a logical proof. This correspondence formalizes programming and allows for mathematical reasoning about the correctness of programs.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to formal verification, programming languages, and the Curry-Howard correspondence.

- Some users recommend studying formal methods and formal verification languages to gain a deeper understanding of proof-based programming. They suggest resources such as Coq, Isabelle, and Software Foundations.
- Others express the difficulty in understanding formal methods and suggest that it is a challenging field that requires a strong mathematical background.
- One user shares a link to a book on Programming Language Types by Benjamin Pierce.
- There is a discussion about dependent types and Homotopy Type Theory, with some users recommending Idris and Agda as programming languages that implement these concepts effectively.
- A user mentions Lamport's work on Computation State Machines and how it relates to the mathematics of programming.
- The importance of composability and correctness in formal programming is highlighted, with some users emphasizing the need for business stakeholders to appreciate the value of mathematical reasoning in software development.

Overall, the discussion is quite technical and focused on the intersection of mathematics and programming.

### Building a collaborative pixel art editor with CRDTs

#### [Submission URL](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/) | 151 points | by [jakelazaroff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jakelazaroff) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37832432)

In today's post "Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs" on jakelazaroff.com, the author takes us through the process of using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to build a collaborative pixel art editor. The post assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs and provides a basic introduction to the topic.

The author starts by explaining that they will be using JavaScript and graphics programming to demonstrate how CRDTs can be implemented in a real-world application. They provide the necessary code to build the CRDT, which is a class called PixelData that acts as a wrapper over a Last Write Wins (LWW) Map. The PixelData class maps pixel coordinates to colors, with each key representing a single pixel.

The author then provides a visualization of how the keys and values interact when drawing on the canvas. They show how painting a pixel sets the key value to the selected RGB color, and how pixels that haven't been set default to white. When painting over a pixel, the value is overwritten and the timestamp is incremented.

Moving on to the UI, the author shares the HTML and CSS code for setting up the canvas and color input elements. They then provide JavaScript code to instantiate two editors, Alice and Bob, which are instances of the PixelEditor class. The states of Alice and Bob are merged whenever a change is made in either editor, and the color is set based on user input.

Overall, this post serves as a practical example of how CRDTs can be used in a collaborative application, specifically a pixel art editor. By following the author's explanations and code samples, readers can gain a deeper understanding of CRDTs and how they can be implemented in their own projects.

The discussion revolves around several aspects of the post. 

One user points out that training models to resolve conflicts in collaborative dating can be interesting, and they mention a specific case on GitHub where conflict resolution was handled manually. They also suggest that having non-interactive resolution as the default in developer tools could lead to the loss of work in certain situations, like large refactorings.

Another user mentions that conflicts in CRDTs can be resolved at a semantic layer and provides an example of how conflicts in a canvas can be resolved by prioritizing the most recent drawing. They emphasize the importance of understanding semantics to resolve conflicts effectively.

There is a discussion about whether or not text convergence is guaranteed with CRDTs. One user argues that CRDTs do not guarantee semantic content preservation, while another user explains how they handle nested data in a CRDT to ensure content convergence.

The discussion also touches on the benefits of CRDTs and how they can handle conflict resolution in a self-driving manner, making it easier to work with conflicts in simpler domains.

Another user raises the challenge of preserving the intent of content, particularly when it involves making human-like judgment calls, and mentions that CRDTs provide consistency but may not handle judgment calls effectively.

There is also dialogue about the convergence of state in CRDTs, with one user pointing out that while CRDTs technically converge resulting in the same state, the neural network approach ensures that the final state matches the human's intended state more reliably.

A user shares a link to a related discussion on Our World Pixels, mentioning the date and number of comments.

Finally, there are a few comments about the syntax, font, and highlighting of code in the post, with one user suggesting a specific font family for code.

The discussion is informative and includes various perspectives and insights related to the topic of CRDTs and collaborative pixel art editing.

### Artificial General Intelligence Is Already Here

#### [Submission URL](https://www.noemamag.com/artificial-general-intelligence-is-already-here/) | 25 points | by [falava](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=falava) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37836957)

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems that exhibit human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks, is already here, according to Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas, a vice president at Google Research, and Peter Norvig, a computer scientist at Stanford. They argue that although today's advanced AI models have many flaws, they have already achieved the key properties of generality that define AGI. These "frontier models" can perform a variety of tasks, operate on different modalities like text, images, and audio, handle multiple languages, and learn from prompts rather than just training data. While these models still have limitations, the authors believe they will be recognized as the first true examples of AGI in the future. They compare this to the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, which paved the way for today's computers. The authors emphasize that AGI should be seen as a multidimensional scorecard rather than a simple yes/no proposition.

### The rent is too damn algorithmic

#### [Submission URL](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/631461/the-rent-is-too-damn-algorithmic/) | 111 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37829575)

Attorney General Brian Schwalb is investigating a company called RealPage for potential antitrust violations in the housing industry. RealPage provides software that recommends rent prices for apartments based on market data. Critics argue that the company's algorithm effectively enables collusion among big landlords to fix prices. Schwalb has proposed hiring a law firm to assist with the investigation and potential litigation against RealPage and other targets in the housing industry. The Texas-based company is already facing multiple lawsuits and an antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice. This could be one of the first challenges to RealPage by state attorneys general.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission focuses on various aspects of the antitrust investigation against RealPage and the implications of their software on the housing market. Here are the main points discussed:

- Some users argue that RealPage's software enables collusion among landlords and effectively fixes rent prices. They point out that the software allows landlords to coordinate and set prices based on market data, potentially leading to higher rents.
- Others suggest that the problem lies with the shortage of housing supply, rather than RealPage's software. They argue that if there were enough available housing units, the market forces would naturally adjust prices. They criticize the company for taking advantage of the scarcity of housing.
- There is a debate about whether the actions of RealPage constitute a market manipulation or just a reflection of the supply and demand dynamics. Some users argue that market forces are at play, while others believe that there is a manipulation of prices by large landlords.
- One user suggests that one possible solution to address the issue would be to remove class entirely from residential property. They argue that housing should not be treated as an investment, as it contributes to pricing out many people and exacerbates the shortage of affordable housing.
- The discussion also touches on the idea of induced demand and its impact on traffic congestion. Some users argue that increasing housing supply could lead to more people moving to the city and worsening congestion, while others believe that the lack of affordable housing forces people to live far away from their workplaces, causing traffic jams.
- A user mentions the housing market in Germany, where the construction of housing is more focused on short-term rentals and leads to a shortage of affordable housing. They argue that construction should prioritize long-term housing solutions and consider the environmental impact.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and different perspectives surrounding the investigation into RealPage and the broader issues of affordability and market dynamics in the housing industry.

### Disney Packed Big Emotion into a Little Robot

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/disney-robot) | 51 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37818009)

At the 2023 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), a Disney Research team unveiled a new robotic character that combines animation and reinforcement learning to achieve emotive movements. The robot, developed by a team led by Moritz BÃ¤cher from Disney Research in Zurich, features a child-size body with an expressive head, wiggly antennae, and stubby legs. Disney has a long history of programming robots to exhibit emotive behaviors, but as robots become more advanced and mobile, it becomes challenging to develop motions that are both expressive and compatible with real-world constraints. The team spent a year developing a new system that leverages reinforcement learning to convert an animator's vision into robust and expressive motions that can work in different environments. The robot, which is mostly 3D printed, has a four-degree-of-freedom head and five-degree-of-freedom legs with hip joints for dynamic walking and balancing. Disney's expertise in character animation coupled with technical expertise in building mechanical systems allows them to create lifelike performances.

### Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in LMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406) | 72 points | by [yuchiz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yuchiz) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37816614)

Researchers have introduced a new framework called Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) that aims to enhance the decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs). While LLMs have shown impressive performance on decision-making tasks, they often lack the ability to act as autonomous agents. LATS utilizes LLMs as agents, value functions, and optimizers, drawing inspiration from Monte Carlo tree search in model-based reinforcement learning. The framework incorporates an environment for external feedback, offering a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism. Experimental evaluation in various domains, including programming and web browsing, demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of LATS. For instance, LATS achieves a score of 94.4% for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and an average score of 75.9 for web browsing on WebShop with GPT-3.5. This research opens doors for enhancing the capabilities of language models in reasoning, acting, and planning.

In a recent incident, tech journalist Dan Moren experienced a frustrating iCloud outage that left him unable to access his email, sync his data, or use various iCloud-dependent apps and services. Despite initially troubleshooting the issue himself, he eventually reached out to Apple support, who informed him that his services would be back up and running approximately 12 hours after they initially went down. Moren had to wait through the day with limited functionality before everything finally started working again at exactly 9 p.m. Although he was relieved when his iCloud services were restored, he was left with unanswered questions about why the outage occurred and why there was no advanced warning or communication from Apple about the issue.

The discussion surrounding the submission includes various perspectives on the iCloud outage experienced by journalist Dan Moren. Some users sympathize with Moren's frustration and criticize Apple for the lack of communication and advanced warning about the issue. Others argue that it is the user's responsibility to have a backup strategy and that relying solely on iCloud may not be the best approach. Some users recommend using a NAS to mirror the contents of iCloud regularly. Additionally, there are discussions about alternative backup solutions, such as Elcomsoft's Phone Breaker and Time Machine, as well as the issue of privacy with iCloud. Some users express their distrust in cloud services, emphasizing the importance of personal backups on external hard drives. Others share their negative experiences with iCloud, such as disappearing storage and issues with iCloud DriveFuse.

### IBM CEO in damage control mode after AI job loss comments

IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has stated that the company has no intention of laying off developers or programmers and plans to increase hiring in these areas. Krishna wants to ramp up hiring of software engineering and sales staff over the next four years to accommodate the company's focus on generative AI. The announcement follows IBM's decision earlier this year to cut 8,000 staff positions in its HR division in order to automate roles. Krishna has been vocal about AI-related job losses, stating in August that the influx of generative AI tools should make people "feel better," despite concerns about their impact on the labor market.

The discussion on this submission revolves around IBM's decision to focus on hiring developers and programmers for its generative AI efforts while cutting staff positions in its HR division. 

One user, Aerroon, highlights that the number of job cuts in the HR division is significant, considering the large workforce dedicated to HR in the company. Another user, lxf, points out that the summary of the article is poorly quoted and suggests that the HR cuts are similar to those faced by customer-facing roles. Aerroon acknowledges this and realizes a part of his original comment doesn't make sense.

In response to the news, ptr mentions that future employment at IBM will likely focus on generative AI, rather than HR roles, which can be automated. Unfrozen0688, however, voices skepticism about the reliance on AI and suggests that the decision to cut HR roles is based on a biased perspective on technology and a dismissive view of non-technical staff. Snpcstr agrees, saying that the cuts are based on bias against HR roles.
