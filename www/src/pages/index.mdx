Monty Anderson, in his blog post titled "Embeddings, Vectors, and Arithmetic," explores the concept of embeddings as a representation of text and the computational operations that can be performed on them. He references Lilian Weng's project, which showcases a ranking of the closest emojis to a search query in the meaning-space. The emoji vectors are calculated using the OpenAI's Ada model, and the results are based on the euclidean distance or cosine similarity. Building on this idea, Anderson and Barney Hill developed an app that allows users to add two emojis and find the closest known emoji to that result. While the project worked well, it also revealed the stereotypes and flaws present in the training data. Anderson mentions their exploration of building safety systems at Prodia by checking if input prompts are within a distance threshold of known adult or illegal concepts. The post concludes by hinting at a fuzzy future where machines can reason about meaning in various types of data, not just text.
