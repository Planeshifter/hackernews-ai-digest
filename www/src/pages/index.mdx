### Finding near-duplicates with Jaccard similarity and MinHash

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/) | 226 points | by [brianyu8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianyu8) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872438)

In a recent blog post, the author delves into the topic of approximate deduplication using Jaccard similarity and the MinHash approximation technique. The post explores the concept of defining similarity between documents and the challenges of approximate deduplication at scale.

The Jaccard index, a measure widely used in text processing, compares sets by calculating the ratio of their overlap to the size of their union. The author explains how this index intuitively captures the similarity between sets based on their elements.

To scale up the process of finding approximate duplicates, the post discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing techniques for Jaccard similarity. By creating MinHash signatures for documents, which are small, fixed-size representations of the original sets, similar documents can be grouped efficiently.

By employing random sampling techniques and permutations, MinHash signatures offer a way to estimate Jaccard similarity between documents without examining the entire sets. This approach provides a practical method for identifying approximate duplicates within a large collection of documents.

The AI industry is facing an important question: where is all the revenue? In a recent analysis, it is estimated that the revenue gap in the AI ecosystem has grown from $200 billion to $600 billion. Companies like Nvidia are at the forefront of this boom, with their revenue forecast playing a significant role in this calculation.

Despite a previous GPU supply shortage, the situation has improved, making it easier for startups to access GPUs. Nvidia's data center revenue, particularly from cloud providers like Microsoft, is substantial. However, concerns arise about stockpiling hardware and the impact it could have on demand in the future.

OpenAI continues to lead in AI revenue, overshadowing other startups in the field. The value proposition of AI products for consumers is crucial for sustained growth in the industry. As big players like Google, Microsoft, and Meta aim to generate significant AI-related revenue, the gap to fill continues to widen.

The introduction of Nvidia's B100 chip promises better performance at a slightly higher cost, possibly sparking a new surge in demand. However, challenges such as lack of pricing power, potential capital incineration, rapid depreciation of current technology, and picking winners in a crowded market remain key considerations for the future of AI.

The discussion on Hacker News covers a wide range of topics related to the original submission about the revenue gap in the AI industry. The conversation delves into technical details such as the number of GPUs needed to train large AI models, the introduction of new chips like Nvidia's B100, and the challenges faced by companies in the AI ecosystem.

Additionally, there are discussions about the implications of VR technology on people's preference for virtual experiences over real-life activities, with references to popular culture like Star Trek and Ready Player One. The conversation also touches on regulatory issues, the impact of AI on the job market, and ethical considerations surrounding AI development.

Overall, the comments provide insights into various aspects of the AI industry, including technical challenges, societal impacts, and ethical considerations, reflecting a diverse range of perspectives and expertise from the Hacker News community.
