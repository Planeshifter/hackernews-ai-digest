### Confidential computing and AI fit together

#### [Submission URL](https://www.edgeless.systems/blog/how-confidential-computing-and-ai-fit-together/) | 46 points | by [transpute](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=transpute) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37955620)

In this blog post, Felix Schuster explores the intersection of AI and confidential computing. He explains the concept of "Confidential AI" and highlights three major use cases: secure outsourcing of AI workloads, intellectual property (IP) protection for AI models, and privacy-preserving AI training and inference. Schuster notes that until recently, confidential computing couldn't practically be applied to AI due to the lack of trust between secure enclaves and AI accelerators. However, Nvidia's latest GPUs, like the Hopper H100, now come with comprehensive confidential computing features, allowing for secure communication between CPUs and GPUs.

He provides a technical summary of how Nvidia implements confidential computing, including remote attestation, encryption of communication between CPUs and GPUs, and memory isolation. With these foundations in place, confidential AI becomes possible. The first use case Schuster discusses is the secure outsourcing of AI workloads. This enables companies to outsource AI tasks to an infrastructure they may not fully trust, such as a cloud provider. It can be particularly useful for banks or government institutions.

The second use case is IP protection for AI models. Confidential AI allows for the deployment of AI models in a way that prevents copying or altering. This is valuable when deploying proprietary AI models to customer sites or integrating them into 3rd party offerings. Finally, Schuster explores privacy-preserving AI training and inference. Confidential computing enables the creation of "black box" systems that verifiably preserve privacy for data sources. By designing software to keep input data private and running it in a confidential-computing environment, data sources can be assured that their data will remain private. With confidential computing-enabled GPUs, AI training and inference can now be performed while preserving data privacy.

Overall, Schuster highlights the exciting possibilities that arise from combining AI and confidential computing, opening up new avenues for secure and privacy-preserving applications.
