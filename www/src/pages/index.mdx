In the ongoing race for optimized machine learning performance, a recent benchmark study dives into the memory saturation effects during inference using NVIDIA's H100 and AMD's MI300x GPUs with the Llama 3.1 405B FP8 model. This analysis sheds light on how GPU memory impacts both performance and cost, a vital consideration for those deploying large language models (LLMs).

The benchmark reveals that while NVIDIA's H100 excels in processing requests with a 74% increase in requests per second, the AMD MI300x showcases its cost-effectiveness across larger prompts. On a per-token basis, the 8xMI300x setup outshines the H100 when handling substantial batch sizes, highlighting the necessity of adequate memory for smooth operations. 

Interestingly, running two replicas on four MI300x GPUs showed better throughput for smaller inputs, capitalizing on parallel execution to enhance underutilized resources. However, it fell short during larger workloads, as memory saturation forced the MI300x to fall back on CPU memory, throttling performance.
