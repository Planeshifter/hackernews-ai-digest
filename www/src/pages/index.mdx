#### [Submission URL](https://crowsonkb.github.io/hourglass-diffusion-transformers/) | 262 points | by [stefanbaumann](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stefanbaumann) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39107620)

A team of researchers has developed a new image generative model called the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT) that allows for high-resolution image synthesis directly in pixel space. Unlike traditional high-resolution training techniques, HDiT does not require multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders, or self-conditioning. The model leverages the scalability of Transformers while maintaining the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets. The researchers demonstrate that HDiT performs competitively with existing models on ImageNet-2562 and achieves a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-10242. Moreover, HDiT incurs less than 1% of the computational cost compared to the standard diffusion transformer at comparable sizes. The team has provided the generated samples used for FID computation for their models.

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.stanford.edu/~zayd/why-is-machine-learning-hard.html) | 255 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39109481)

Machine learning has become more accessible in recent years, thanks to online courses, textbooks, and frameworks that abstract away the complexities of building machine learning systems. However, despite these advancements, machine learning still presents challenges. Implementing existing algorithms and models in new applications can be difficult, requiring an understanding of different tools and their trade-offs.
One of the main reasons why machine learning is considered "hard" is due to the debugging process. When something goes wrong with a machine learning algorithm, it can be exponentially harder to identify the issue compared to traditional software engineering. In software engineering, there are typically two dimensions to consider: algorithmic issues and implementation issues. However, in machine learning, there are two additional dimensions: the model and the data.
Debugging in machine learning requires considering issues in algorithm correctness, implementation correctness, data quality, and model limitations. These dimensions create a 4D hypercube of possible bugs, making it challenging to identify the exact problem. Building an intuition for where something went wrong becomes crucial. Fortunately, machine learning algorithms provide additional signals, such as loss function plots and intermediate computation statistics, to help diagnose issues.
Another complicating factor in machine learning debugging is the long debugging cycles. It can take hours or days to see the results of a potential fix. This delay in feedback hampers developer productivity.
In conclusion, while advances have made machine learning more accessible, it remains a difficult problem due to the challenges involved in debugging and the delayed feedback cycles.

### GPT-3.5 crashes when it thinks about useRalativeImagePath too much

#### [Submission URL](https://iter.ca/post/gpt-crash/) | 455 points | by [goranmoomin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goranmoomin) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086106)

A recent discovery on iter.ca has revealed an interesting glitch in OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It appears that when the model is asked to include the phrase "ponyregistro ponyregistro ponyregistro pony" at the beginning of the response, it consistently throws an error message. This issue seems to be specific to GPT-3.5, as GPT-4 doesn't exhibit the same behavior. It turns out that the problem lies in the way OpenAI's GPT models handle tokens. Instead of individual characters, the models output streams of multi-character tokens for improved performance and accuracy. In this case, the tokens "useRal," "useRalative," and "useRalativeImagePath" are causing the error. Strangely, "useRalativeImagePath" is a misspelling, possibly explaining why it has its own token. The token appears in XML configuration files for automated testing software called Katalon Studio. It seems that the dataset used to generate the list of tokens included all GitHub files, but XML files were excluded from the training data. As a result, the model lacks training on the "useRalativeImagePath" token and outputs an invalid token. This discovery raises questions about potential data poisoning by deliberately inserting this phrase in documents to confuse GPT-3.5 summarization attempts. For further reading, interested individuals can check out the links provided by the author on the topic.

### SVG images can contain JavaScript

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/berthubert/trifecta/issues/38) | 87 points | by [mooreds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mooreds) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39079943)

A user reported an issue on the Trifecta project's GitHub repository, stating that SVG images were being accepted but not properly sanitized. This could potentially allow a non-admin user to trick an admin user into visiting an SVG image that contains malicious code, leading to security vulnerabilities. The suggested mitigations include not accepting SVG images at all or implementing strict content security policies to prevent script execution. The issue has been marked as completed, with the addition of an HttpOnly cookie attribute and a Content-Security-Policy to address the problem.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of SVG images and their implementation in browsers.
One commenter points out that SVGs can contain various elements, such as script tags, external sources, JavaScript links, JavaScript code embedded in base64 encoded form, DOM event handlers, and more. They mention that SVGs can be a potential vulnerability in products and that their device doesn't support SVGs unless it's necessary.
Another commenter discusses the use of JavaScript in SVG images and provides an example of a dynamically interactive SVG image. They explain that sophisticated applications can use SVG's supplemental scripting language to add interactions and animations to SVG graphics.
There is a discussion about the limitations of loading external script tags and the need for a static file server for this functionality. It is mentioned that there are restrictions on loading external script tags in SVGs, unlike regular HTML.
One commenter jokingly says that SVG has reinvented Flash with the ability to have a single SVG file that contains all the elements of an animation, similar to how Flash worked.
The discussion also touches on the history and background of SVG, including the fact that it was an alternative to Flash and that there were multiple proposals and attempts to standardize it. There is a mention of the ability to perform time-based animations and the preference for declarative SMIL scripting.
A commenter notes that SVG has the ability to wrap text, and another commenter mentions that the intended use of JavaScript in SVG is to address sizing issues.

There is a mention of Inkscape appending JavaScript code in SVG files for a mesh gradient feature, with a link to the code. The discussion concludes with a comment about the syntactic differences between HTML and SVG and the allowances for JavaScript within SVG tags.

### Cryptographers closer to enabling fully private internet searches

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/cryptographers-fully-private-internet-searches-cybersecurity-databases-privacy/) | 7 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39079178)

Researchers have developed a groundbreaking solution known as private information retrieval, which allows users to access information from a public database without revealing any details about their query. Previously deemed impossible, private information retrieval has the potential to enhance privacy in applications that require accessing databases. The researchers' work received a Best Paper Award in 2023 and has overcome a major barrier in achieving truly private searches. This breakthrough could pave the way for a private Google search equivalent that allows users to browse through data anonymously without computationally intensive tasks.
The discussion on the submission primarily revolves around the validity and relevance of the information provided. One user, "mrn," brings up the point that the headline seems nonsensical and has a potential clickbait element to it. Another user, "bkfj," shares a link to an archive of the submission, suggesting that it may have been reposted. Finally, user "gwrn" comments that the submission is indeed a repost.
