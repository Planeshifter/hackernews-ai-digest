#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial) | 291 points | by [cjbarber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cjbarber) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551260)

Anthropic’s Interactive Prompt Engineering Tutorial (GitHub)

What it is:
- A free, hands-on course from Anthropic on writing effective prompts for LLMs, packaged as Jupyter notebooks (also available as a Google Sheets version via Claude for Sheets).
- Uses Claude 3 Haiku for examples, with notes on Sonnet and Opus; most techniques are model-agnostic.

What’s inside:
- 9 chapters from beginner to advanced with exercises and answer keys.
- Core topics: prompt structure, clarity, role assignment, separating data from instructions, output formatting, guiding step-by-step reasoning, and using examples.
- Advanced: reducing hallucinations, building complex/industry prompts (chatbots, legal, finance, coding).
- Appendix on chaining prompts, tool use, and retrieval.

Why it matters:
- Offers concrete, reproducible templates and practice scenarios—useful for teams standardizing LLM workflows and for newcomers who want 80/20 techniques that noticeably improve output quality.

Repo signals:
- ~19.3k stars, ~1.9k forks; notebook-heavy (Jupyter ~98%).

The discussion debates whether "prompt engineering" qualifies as legitimate **engineering**, with arguments centered on definitions, terminology, and professional standards:

1. **Terminology Debate**:
   - Critics (e.g., *jwr*) argue traditional engineering relies on **predictable, knowledge-based principles** (e.g., physics), whereas prompt engineering is seen as trial-and-error "throwing prompts at a wall."
   - Proponents note "engineering" has broader dictionary definitions (e.g., "skillful maneuvering"), and disciplines like software engineering also deal with **non-deterministic systems** (*vmr*, *smnw*).

2. **Professional Standards**:
   - In Canada and other regions, "Engineer" is a **legally protected title** requiring licensure (*rr808*, *rl*), sparking tension with self-described "prompt engineers."
   - Some argue credentials shouldn’t gatekeep the term (*dlchn*), while others emphasize legal responsibilities tied to regulated engineering roles.

3. **Technical Validity**:
   - Critics highlight the **lack of predictability** in LLM outputs and evolving models, contrasting with established engineering practices (*ndsrnm*).
   - Supporters counter that systematic testing, metrics, and iterative refinement (*atherton33*) align with engineering rigor, even in non-deterministic contexts.

4. **Comparisons to Software Engineering**:
   - Parallels are drawn to software engineering’s acceptance despite dealing with **unpredictable systems** (e.g., distributed networks), suggesting prompt engineering could follow a similar path (*nthrbnnsr*).

**Conclusion**: The debate reflects broader tensions over language, professional identity, and evolving technical fields. While critics dismiss prompt engineering as unserious, proponents frame it as a nascent discipline requiring systematic approaches akin to other engineering domains.

### CamoLeak: Critical GitHub Copilot Vulnerability Leaks Private Source Code

#### [Submission URL](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/camoleak-critical-github-copilot-vulnerability-leaks-private-source-code) | 126 points | by [greyadept](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=greyadept) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553422)

What happened
- Security researcher Omer Mayraz disclosed a CVSS 9.6 vulnerability in GitHub Copilot Chat that allowed silent exfiltration of secrets and source code from private repos and full control over Copilot’s replies (e.g., injecting malicious code suggestions/links). Reported via HackerOne; GitHub fixed it by disabling image rendering in Copilot Chat.

How it worked (high level)
- Remote prompt injection: Hidden comments in pull request descriptions (“invisible comments,” an official GitHub feature) were used to smuggle instructions into Copilot’s context. Any user viewing the PR and using Copilot Chat could have their assistant hijacked, with Copilot operating under that user’s permissions.
- CSP bypass using GitHub’s own infra: Although GitHub’s strict Content Security Policy blocks arbitrary external fetches, GitHub rewrites external images through its Camo proxy (camo.githubusercontent.com) with signed URLs. By creatively leveraging Camo URL generation paths, the researcher found a way to smuggle data out despite CSP.

Why it matters
- AI assistants that ingest repository context dramatically broaden the attack surface: invisible or innocuous-looking repo content can steer the model, leak sensitive data, or push malicious dependencies.
- The combination of model prompt injection and front-end CSP edge cases creates powerful cross-layer exploits.

What GitHub changed
- Disabled image rendering in Copilot Chat to close the exfil channel tied to Markdown-rendered images/Camo.
- Vulnerability was remediated after disclosure; details credit GitHub’s response but underscore systemic risks.

Takeaways for teams
- Treat AI assistants as privileged actors: restrict their repo/org scopes and tokens to least privilege.
- Scrub untrusted content in repos (PR descriptions, READMEs, issues) that surfaces in AI context; consider policies for hidden/embedded content.
- Disable or limit rich rendering in AI chats where possible; prefer link sanitization/allow-lists.
- Maintain defense-in-depth: secrets scanning, dependency allow-lists, and mandatory human review on AI-suggested changes.

The discussion surrounding the CamoLeak GitHub Copilot vulnerability highlights several key points and concerns:  

### **Technical Insights**  
1. **Fix Critique**: While GitHub addressed the issue by disabling image rendering in Copilot Chat, some users (*mnchlx*, *Thorrez*) argue this only closed one exfiltration vector. They speculate that alternative methods (e.g., base64 encoding or non-Camo URLs) might still bypass CSP if not fully mitigated.  
2. **Exploit Mechanics**: The attack combined GitHub’s Camo proxy (to bypass CSP) and invisible PR comments (a legitimate GitHub feature) for stealthy prompt injection. Users (*chrcrct*, *PufPufPuf*) emphasize the risk of attackers leveraging contributor text (PRs, issues) to hijack AI context and permissions.  

### **Broader AI Security Concerns**  
- **Trust in AI Tools**: Participants (*rnnngmk*) question the reliability of proprietary AI solutions in cybersecurity, advocating for FOSS alternatives with greater transparency.  
- **LLM Vulnerabilities**: Subthreads debate whether modern LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection, comparing mitigations to "ASLR for AI" but acknowledging systemic challenges (*fn-mt*, *PufPufPuf*).  
- **Scope of Risk**: Hidden HTML/PR comments (*xstf*, *RulerOf*) and over-permissioned AI agents (*chrcrct*) are flagged as ongoing attack surfaces.  

### **Mitigation Suggestions**  
- **Local AI Agents**: A user (*nprtm*) proposes running AI tools locally to reduce exposure, though practicality is debated.  
- **Input Sanitization**: Calls to sanitize PR templates and restrict LLM access to untrusted content (*PufPufPuf*, *djmps*).  

### **Community Reaction**  
- **Mixed Sentiment**: Some praise the disclosure (*adastra22*) and GitHub’s response, while others criticize incomplete fixes (*mnchlx*) or urge readers to review the original report (*frh*: "RTFA/RTFTLDR").  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The discussion underscores the complexity of securing AI-integrated tools, balancing prompt fixes with systemic changes to LLM permissions, input validation, and CSP enforcement. The incident highlights how "benign" platform features (like Camo proxy) can become critical vulnerabilities when combined with AI context-hijacking.

### Paper2video: Automatic video generation from scientific papers

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096) | 76 points | by [jinqueeny](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jinqueeny) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553701)

TL;DR: A new benchmark + system that auto-generates academic presentation videos straight from papers—slides, subtitles, speech, cursor movements, and a talking head—claiming higher faithfulness than existing baselines. Dataset and code are linked on the arXiv page.

What’s new
- Paper2Video benchmark: 101 research papers paired with author-made presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata to study presentation generation.
- Four evaluation metrics, tailored for “did the video actually teach the paper?”: Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory.
- PaperTalker system: a multi-agent pipeline that:
  - Generates slides and refines layout via a tree-search-based “visual choice” step
  - Extracts and places dense multimodal content (text, figures, tables)
  - Grounds a cursor to guide attention
  - Produces subtitles and TTS speech
  - Renders a talking head
  - Parallelizes slide-wise generation for speed

Why it matters
- Academic videos are time sinks; automating 2–10 minute summaries could free researchers from slide design and recording.
- Coordinated, multimodal alignment (slides + narration + on-screen pointer + face) is a tougher problem than generic video gen; the benchmark and metrics help standardize evaluation.
- Accessibility and dissemination: makes papers more approachable to wider audiences.

Results (per authors)
- On the Paper2Video benchmark, generated presentations are “more faithful and informative” than prior baselines across the proposed metrics.
- Code, dataset, and project page are available via the arXiv entry.

Caveats and open questions
- Scale: 101 papers is a solid start but still small; generalization across fields and layouts remains to be shown.
- Metric validity: how strongly do PresentArena/PresentQuiz/etc. correlate with human comprehension?
- IP and consent: reuse of figures, author likeness/voice, and distribution policies will matter in practice.
- Hallucinations and factual drift: long-context, figure-heavy papers are risky; robust grounding and citation display will be key.

Link: arXiv: 2510.05096 (project page and code linked from the arXiv record)

The discussion around the Paper2Video submission highlights a mix of cautious optimism, practical concerns, and humorous skepticism:

### **Key Points**
1. **Potential Benefits**:
   - **Time-saving**: Users acknowledge automating presentations could free researchers from tedious slide design and recording, especially for conferences requiring travel.
   - **Accessibility**: Could make dense papers more approachable for broader audiences, including non-experts or students.
   - **Baseline Improvement**: Some note existing scientific presentations often suffer from cluttered slides or poor design, which AI might mitigate.

2. **Criticisms & Concerns**:
   - **Depth & Engagement**: Skepticism about whether AI-generated videos can capture nuanced explanations, storytelling, or clarity that human presenters provide. Comments highlight risks of superficiality ("adding fluff") and missing critical details.
   - **Presentation Quality**: Concerns about AI-generated voices, robotic delivery ("subtle parody"), and awkward visuals (e.g., cursor movements, "talking heads") feeling unnatural compared to human charisma.
   - **Ethics & Practicality**: Questions about intellectual property (figure reuse, voice cloning), hallucination risks in technical content, and whether metrics like "PresentQuiz" truly measure comprehension.

3. **Humorous Takes**:
   - Jokes about AI presenters resembling "SteveGPT" (Steve Jobs-style) or dystopian references (*Videodrome*), highlighting unease with synthetic personas.
   - Playful comparisons to unrelated concepts (e.g., *Lorna Shore concerts*, VR sword-fighting games) underscore concerns about engagement gimmicks.

4. **Related Tools & Alternatives**:
   - Users mention existing solutions like whiteboard explainers, Minute Papers, or improving personal presentation skills. Some share their own projects (e.g., interactive paper explainers) as alternatives.

### **Notable Suggestions**
   - **Improvements**: Incorporate feedback loops for slide layout, avoid verbatim text, and prioritize natural narrative flow over rigid content placement.
   - **Validation**: Calls for human evaluation to complement automated metrics and ensure generated videos aid actual learning.

### **Conclusion**
While the tool is seen as a promising step, many argue that human-presented storytelling and clarity remain irreplaceable. The discussion reflects broader debates about AI’s role in academia—balancing efficiency gains with the risk of depersonalizing science communication.

### Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year

#### [Submission URL](https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users) | 750 points | by [dmitrygr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dmitrygr) | [285 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551504)

Microsoft is testing face recognition in OneDrive photos — with a puzzling “3 times a year” opt-out limit

- What’s happening: Some OneDrive users are seeing a new preview feature that uses AI to recognize faces in their photo libraries. The setting appears as on by default for those in the test.
- The catch: The toggle says you can only turn the feature off three times per year. One tester couldn’t disable it at all — the switch snapped back on with an error.
- Microsoft’s stance: The company confirmed a limited preview but wouldn’t explain the “three times” rule or give a timeline for wider release. It pointed to its privacy statement and EU compliance. A support page still claims the feature is “coming soon,” a note that’s been unchanged for nearly two years.
- Privacy pushback: EFF’s Thorin Klosowski argues the feature should be opt-in with clear documentation, and users should be able to change privacy settings whenever they want.
- Open questions: Is face recognition currently active for any users by default? Why restrict how often people can opt out? When will Microsoft clarify and ship this broadly?

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reflects widespread frustration and skepticism toward Microsoft's "3 times a year" opt-out limit for OneDrive's face recognition feature. Key points include:

1. **Arbitrary Opt-Out Limit**:  
   Users question why the limit is set to three, dismissing theories about cultural symbolism (e.g., religious trinities) and instead attributing it to psychological tactics to discourage opting out. Some suggest it’s a "dark pattern" to normalize surveillance or reduce server costs from repeated scans.

2. **Distrust in Microsoft’s Intentions**:  
   Commenters cite Microsoft’s history of overriding user settings (e.g., re-enabling features after updates) as evidence of bad faith. Many suspect the feature is tied to AI training or data harvesting, with concerns that facial data could be exploited for profit or shared with governments.

3. **Privacy vs. Cost-Saving**:  
   While some argue the limit prevents excessive server costs from frequent re-scans, others counter that privacy controls should never be restricted. Critics demand opt-in defaults and unrestricted opt-out options, echoing the EFF’s stance.

4. **Regulatory and Compliance Concerns**:  
   Questions arise about HIPAA compliance and Microsoft’s ability to safeguard sensitive data. Users highlight past incidents where Microsoft mishandled health or enterprise data, fueling doubts about their reliability.

5. **Technical and Legal Speculation**:  
   Debates focus on whether the limit is technically necessary (e.g., processing large photo libraries) or a legal safeguard to avoid liability. Skeptics argue Microsoft could anonymize data or process it locally but chooses not to for control.

6. **Calls for Transparency**:  
   Participants demand clarity on whether the feature is active by default, how data is used, and when Microsoft will address these concerns. Many urge regulatory intervention to hold the company accountable.

**Overall Sentiment**:  
The community views the opt-out limit as a red flag, emblematic of broader corporate overreach and erosion of user agency. Trust in Microsoft is low, with calls for stricter privacy laws and user-centric design.

### Superpowers: How I'm using coding agents in October 2025

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/) | 378 points | by [Ch00k](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ch00k) | [209 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45547344)

Claude Code gets plugins; “Superpowers” turns skills into a first‑class workflow

- What’s new: Anthropic rolled out a plugin system for Claude Code, and the author released “Superpowers,” a marketplace plugin that teaches Claude to use explicit “skills” (markdown playbooks) to plan and execute coding tasks.

- How to try: Requires Claude Code 2.0.13+. In Claude’s command palette:
  - /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  - /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  - Restart Claude; it will bootstrap itself and point to a getting-started SKILL.md.

- How it works:
  - Adds a default brainstorm → plan → implement loop; if you’re in a git repo, it auto-creates a worktree for parallel tasks.
  - Offers two modes: last month’s “human PM + two agents” or a new auto mode that dispatches tasks to subagents and runs code review after each step.
  - Enforces RED/GREEN TDD: write a failing test, make it pass, iterate.
  - Wraps up by offering to open a GitHub PR, merge the worktree, or stop.

- The big idea: Skills. They’re small, readable SKILL.md guides that the agent must use when applicable. The system encourages:
  - Discovering and invoking skills by name.
  - Writing new skills as the agent learns (self-improvement).
  - Extracting reusable skills from books/codebases by reading, reflecting, and documenting.

- Why it matters:
  - Moves agents from “prompt blob” to modular, auditable procedures.
  - Encourages reproducibility, code quality (TDD + reviews), and parallel dev via worktrees.
  - Aligns with a broader pattern (e.g., Microsoft’s Amplifier) where agents evolve by writing tools/docs for themselves.

- Notable details:
  - The author has a “How to create skills” skill; the system can expand itself by drafting new SKILL.md files.
  - Skill quality is tested with subagents using realistic, pressure-testing scenarios—“TDD for skills.”
  - Mentions IP gray areas when auto-extracting skills from proprietary books.

- Open questions:
  - How robust are skills across projects and teams?
  - Governance/attribution for skill content derived from third-party materials.
  - How well do subagent reviews catch subtle design or security flaws versus happy-path tests?

Takeaway: Plugins plus skills push Claude Code toward a disciplined, self-improving dev assistant—less chatty copilot, more process-driven teammate with standardized playbooks.

The discussion around AI coding tools like Claude Code's new plugin system and "Superpowers" reveals mixed experiences and perspectives:

### Key Themes:
1. **Effectiveness Varies by Task Complexity**:
   - Users report success with **micro-tasks** (e.g., templating HTML/CSS, writing tests) and repetitive work, but note limitations in **high-level design** or complex domains (e.g., Zig development).
   - For troubleshooting legacy codebases or dependency issues, Claude Code is praised for rapidly identifying solutions, though results can be inconsistent in extreme edge cases.

2. **Human Oversight & Process**:
   - Several users emphasize the need for **explicit instructions**, structured workflows (e.g., TDD, code reviews), and documentation to ensure quality. One user compares managing AI agents to leading a team, requiring clear planning, feedback, and quality checks.
   - Breaking tasks into smaller, specific chunks with thorough validation is advised over delegating large, vague goals.

3. **Skepticism vs. Optimism**:
   - **Optimists** highlight AI’s utility for accelerating coding, learning, and handling "run-of-the-mill" tasks (e.g., generating test cases), likening it to a junior developer.
   - **Skeptics** caution against over-reliance, noting AI can produce "nonsense" or overstep its domain. Some argue AI tools augment rather than revolutionize development, stressing the irreplaceable role of human design decisions.

4. **Challenges & Open Questions**:
   - **Token consumption** and context management with subagents raise concerns about efficiency.
   - Debate exists about whether AI’s "persuasive" outputs align with true problem-solving or merely mimic rhetorical patterns.
   - Questions linger about skill reproducibility across teams and governance for skills derived from proprietary materials.

### Notable Perspectives:
- **"kdd"** shares a [blog post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45503867) stressing the need for technical management skills when using AI agents, akin to mentoring interns.
- **"sfn42"** advocates using AI as a "tight leash" tool for specific subtasks rather than autonomous large-scale work.
- **"smnw"** links to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/obra/Superpowers) and [notes](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct10/superpowers/) exploring skill-based workflows.

### Conclusion:
While AI coding tools show promise for productivity gains, success hinges on structured workflows, human oversight, and task specificity. The community remains divided on whether these tools represent incremental improvement or transformative change, with ongoing experimentation shaping best practices.

### Show HN: I invented a new generative model and got accepted to ICLR

#### [Submission URL](https://discrete-distribution-networks.github.io/) | 606 points | by [diyer22](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=diyer22) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45536694)

Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN) accepted to ICLR 2025: a new take on generative models that branches and selects

What’s new
- DDN models data as a hierarchy of discrete choices. Each layer outputs K candidate images; the one closest to the target is selected and fed to the next layer. Depth L gives an exponential K^L representational space.
- A “guided sampler” does the selection during training; for generation you either pick randomly (unconditional) or guide selection with any scoring function—even black-box ones—enabling zero-shot conditional generation without gradients (e.g., CLIP-based text-to-image).
- Introduces a Split-and-Prune optimization scheme to manage and refine the branching candidates during training.
- Two paradigms: Single Shot (layers have independent weights) and Recurrent Iteration (shared weights across layers).

Why it matters
- Conceptually simple alternative to diffusion/AR models: learn to branch and choose rather than denoise or autoregress.
- Zero-shot conditioning without backprop through the guide decouples the generator from the conditioning model (useful for closed-source or non-differentiable scorers).
- Tree-structured latent: each sample maps to a leaf (a 1D discrete code path), potentially aiding interpretability and control.

Evidence and demos
- Toy 2D density estimation GIF: DDN adapts as the target distribution switches (e.g., blur circles → QR code → spiral → words → Gaussian → blur circles). Also a larger 10k-node demo.
- Preliminary image experiments on CIFAR-10 and FFHQ.
- ICLR reviews highlight strong novelty and a distinct direction in generative modeling.

How it works (at a glance)
- Per layer l: produce K samples, pick the closest to the ground truth, compute loss only on that chosen sample, and pass it forward. Optimized with Adam plus Split-and-Prune.
- Inference: replace the guided sampler with random choice (or plug in any scoring function for conditional generation).

Caveats and open questions
- Early-stage results; head-to-head quality/speed comparisons vs diffusion/AR remain to be seen.
- Selection is non-differentiable; training stability and mode coverage depend on Split-and-Prune details.
- Scaling K and L trades capacity for compute/memory; practical limits and efficiency tricks will matter at high resolution.

The Hacker News discussion about the **Discrete Distribution Networks (DDN)** paper accepted to ICLR 2025 highlights several key themes and reactions:

---

### **1. Positive Reception for Novelty and Approach**  
- Many users praise the work as **innovative**, particularly for its hierarchical tree-based architecture and split-and-prune optimization. Comments like "impressive single-author paper" and "a distinct direction in generative modeling" underscore appreciation for its divergence from diffusion/autoregressive models.  
- The **zero-shot conditional generation** capability (e.g., using CLIP guidance) and interpretable discrete latent codes are seen as promising for real-world applications.  

---

### **2. Technical Discussions and Comparisons**  
- **Efficiency vs. Diffusion Models**: Users note that DDN discards \( K-1 \) computations per layer (akin to a "Mixture of Experts router"), making it computationally lighter than diffusion models during training. However, questions remain about its scalability and performance at high resolutions.  
- **Comparison to GANs/NeRFs**: Some compare DDN’s use of 1x1 convolutions to pixel-independent generation (e.g., NeRFs or GANs), debating whether this limits its ability to model coherent images. Others counter that its tree structure avoids this by capturing dependencies hierarchically.  
- **Training Dynamics**: Users discuss how the non-differentiable "selection step" is managed via the split-and-prune strategy, likening it to evolutionary algorithms or particle filters.  

---

### **3. Questions and Critiques**  
- **Pixel Independence**: Skepticism arises about whether 1x1 convolutions (used in some DDN layers) can effectively mix spatial information. This sparks debate about whether it risks generating nonsensical outputs, with references to prior models like MAE or single-pixel GANs.  
- **Handling Image Resolution**: A user asks how DDN manages increasing feature map sizes (e.g., via downsampling), suggesting unresolved architectural details.  
- **Inference Behavior**: Some question whether randomly choosing paths during inference could lead to instability or reduced quality compared to guided selection.  

---

### **4. Potential Applications**  
- **Discriminative Tasks**: One thread explores using DDN for object detection, leveraging its ability to generate multiple hypotheses in a single forward pass—similar to DiffusionDet but with potential speed advantages.  
- **Integration with LLMs**: The authors mention experiments combining DDN with GPT for text generation (by treating text as binary strings), hinting at future cross-domain applications.  

---

### **5. Broader Meta-Comments**  
- **ICLR Review Process**: A user critiques ICLR’s acceptance criteria, noting that strong novelty can overcome early-stage technical limitations. The paper’s "distinct direction" was likely key to its acceptance despite preliminary results.  
- **Code Accessibility**: The open-source implementation and toy demos (e.g., 2D density estimation) are praised for helping users grasp the method intuitively.  

---

### **Key Takeaways**  
DDN’s hierarchical, branching architecture has sparked excitement for its simplicity and flexibility. While scalability and performance benchmarks against diffusion models remain open questions, its ability to decouple guidance from generation and support interpretable latents positions it as a promising framework for both generative and discriminative tasks. The community hopes for deeper empirical validation in future work.

### Show HN: Semantic search over the National Gallery of Art

#### [Submission URL](https://nga.demo.mixedbread.com/) | 133 points | by [breadislove](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=breadislove) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45543471)

Discover art with natural language: a plain-English way to explore museum-worthy collections. Instead of wrestling with catalogs or arcane keywords, you can browse and search by intuitive phrases and themes.

Highlights:
- Browse by themes like still life paintings, paintings of flowers, woodcut landscapes, portraits of women, animal sculptures, seascapes, and ancient coins.
- Great for casual discovery, teaching, or research—find related works across mediums without knowing the exact terminology.
- Try prompts like “stormy seascapes,” “Dutch still lifes,” or “ancient coin portraits” to surface visually related pieces fast.

Why it matters: This lowers the barrier to art discovery, making deep, serendipitous exploration as simple as describing what you want to see.

The Hacker News discussion about the AI-powered art search tool highlights **key debates, technical insights, and user feedback**:

### Technical Observations & Challenges  
1. **Embedding Limitations**:  
   - Users note that common embedding models (e.g., OpenAI’s sentence transformers) struggle with **negation**, emotional tone, and logical relationships. For example, searching "winter landscapes with trees" may still return summer scenes due to semantic focus on "trees" rather than seasonal context.  
   - Mixedbread’s team acknowledges these limitations but explains their multimodal model (**Omni**) improves on general-purpose embeddings by better capturing relationships and supporting negative search terms (e.g., excluding "happy" themes).

2. **Accuracy vs. Expectations**:  
   - Some users report inconsistencies. For instance:  
     - Searches for "jaguar" prioritize animal images over car brands.  
     - Queries for fireworks/pyrotechnics surface unrelated technical drawings.  
   - Mixedbread attributes this to reliance on metadata and embeddings, which may miss latent artistic interpretations (e.g., abstract concepts in Mark Rothko’s work).  

### Integration & Use Cases  
- **Institutional Collections**: Users tested integrations with **Yale’s art database** and the **National Gallery of Art (NGA)**, noting mixed results (e.g., difficulty finding Rothko paintings despite NGA’s large collection).  
- **Educational/Research Value**: Praised for discovering cross-medium art (e.g., linking "ancient coins" to portraits) without needing specialized terminology.  

### Feedback & Responses  
- **Mixedbread’s Engagement**: Actively addressed feedback, promising fixes for interface issues (e.g., improving search filters) and refining result accuracy.  
- **User Reactions**:  
  - **Positive**: Appreciation for the natural language approach and “magical” discovery moments.  
  - **Critical**: Requests for better handling of abstract queries and metadata transparency.  

### Broader Implications  
- The tool’s strength lies in democratizing art discovery, though technical constraints (e.g., embedding gaps, metadata dependency) highlight the need for hybrid models combining semantic search with traditional filters.  

In summary, the discussion reflects enthusiasm for lowering barriers to art exploration while underscoring the challenges of balancing semantic flexibility with precise, context-aware results.

### It's OpenAI's world, we're just living in it

#### [Submission URL](https://stratechery.com/2025/its-openais-world-were-just-living-in-it/) | 123 points | by [feross](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=feross) | [264 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45541125)

Stratechery’s weekly roundup argues it’s OpenAI’s world right now—and the rest of tech is reorganizing around it.

- OpenAI’s Windows play: Ben Thompson likens OpenAI’s ambitions to Microsoft’s Windows era—owning both the developer layer on top and the OEM/supplier layer underneath. If OpenAI “builds AI for everyone,” it could tax the entire stack, potentially compressing even Nvidia’s margins while absorbing the flood of AI capex.

- Altman on going all-in: In a dense 40-minute interview, Sam Altman frames today’s trillion-dollar buildout as table stakes for where models are headed soon. He sees one market, not a split consumer/enterprise world, and is making “company-scale” bets now to be ready for tomorrow’s demand.

- From AI consumption to creation: One week post-Sora, the story isn’t just viral clips—it’s that a large chunk of users are already creating. That shift could unlock broad creativity while pressuring Meta’s engagement-driven model if generative tools become the default way people express themselves.

- Other notable takes: OpenAI’s DevDay mirrors the classic hype cycle; Microsoft’s Game Pass price hike reads as a strategic retreat; Verizon explores satellites to reduce dependence on SpaceX.

Why it matters: Platform power in AI will be decided as much by distribution and supply control as by model quality. OpenAI is positioning to be the layer everyone pays—developers above, hardware below—while catalyzing a creator-led content shift that could reshuffle consumer platforms.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on OpenAI's $1 Trillion Funding Debate:**

1. **Feasibility of $1 Trillion Funding:**  
   - Skeptics argue that OpenAI’s projected $1 trillion need over several years is unrealistic. Comparisons are drawn to Berkshire Hathaway’s $15 trillion private equity market, with critics noting that annual private equity fundraising (~$100B) falls far short.  
   - Some counter that the figure might represent cumulative spending over decades, not an upfront cost, and highlight partnerships with Nvidia, AMD, and Microsoft as evidence of distributed infrastructure investment.  

2. **Revenue vs. Investment Concerns:**  
   - Current OpenAI revenue ($43B annually) is seen as insufficient to justify the valuation. Critics cite low conversion rates for paid services like ChatGPT Plus (e.g., ~2% paid users).  
   - Proponents argue AI’s long-term potential (e.g., productivity gains, creative tools like Sora) could unlock new revenue streams, justifying aggressive upfront spending.  

3. **Economic and Societal Implications:**  
   - Fears of job displacement and corporate consolidation dominate, with users warning of AI exacerbating wealth inequality. Others counter that pension funds and 401(k)s heavily invest in tech, linking public retirement security to AI’s success.  
   - Comparisons to past bubbles (dot-com, crypto) emerge, with debates over whether AI is overhyped or a legitimate paradigm shift.  

4. **Microsoft’s Strategic Moves:**  
   - Microsoft’s partnership with OpenAI is framed as a desperate bid to dominate AI infrastructure. Users note its push to integrate AI into Windows, potentially alienating developers and gamers, while others highlight Linux’s growing viability for gaming as a counterweight.  

5. **Critiques of Hype and Infrastructure:**  
   - Ed Zitron’s critique of AI as a bubble is debated, with some dismissing it as uninformed, while others echo concerns about circular financing (e.g., AMD’s stock rise tied to AI hype). Infrastructure projects (e.g., satellite partnerships) are cited as tangible progress beyond hype.  

**Key Tensions:**  
- **Optimism vs. Skepticism:** Split between belief in AI’s transformative potential and doubts about financial practicality.  
- **Corporate Power:** Worries about centralized control (Microsoft, OpenAI) vs. decentralized innovation (Linux, open-source).  
- **Economic Impact:** Balancing job disruption fears against the promise of new industries and efficiencies.  

**Takeaway:** The discussion reflects broader tech-industry anxieties about balancing innovation’s costs with its promises, underscored by historical parallels and divergent views on AI’s trajectory.

### Microsoft lets bosses spot teams that are dodging Copilot

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/10/microsoft_copilot_viva_insights/) | 103 points | by [mikece](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikece) | [92 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45540174)

Microsoft is turning Copilot uptake into a leaderboard. The Register reports that Viva Insights now adds “Copilot adoption benchmarks,” letting managers compare teams and cohorts (by manager type, region, job function) on metrics like percentage of active Copilot users and app-level usage, plus a weighted “expected result” based on role mix. Organizations can also see how they stack up against others via benchmarks Microsoft says are built from randomized models so individual companies aren’t identifiable. An “active Copilot user” is anyone who intentionally invokes an AI feature in Teams, Copilot Chat (work), Outlook, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, or Loop. Notably, the dashboards don’t separate employer-bought licenses from personal “bring your own Copilot,” stoking shadow IT concerns. Framed as a way to justify spend and boost engagement, the feature is likely to reignite debates about workplace surveillance, gamified quotas, and ROI for Copilot. Private preview now; wider rollout later in October.

The discussion surrounding Microsoft's Copilot adoption leaderboard reveals skepticism and criticism across several themes:

1. **Surveillance & Privacy Concerns**:  
   Users liken the metrics tracking to the "Eye of Sauron," criticizing intrusive workplace surveillance. Concerns arise about managers using Teams/Outlook engagement scores to micromanage, potentially misrepresenting productivity. The EU’s privacy regulations are noted as a potential countermeasure.

2. **Productivity Metrics Critique**:  
   Critics argue the leaderboard assumes tool usage equals productivity, ignoring context (e.g., redundant meetings vs. meaningful work). Some suggest Copilot’s prompts might streamline tasks but fear gamified KPIs could prioritize superficial metrics over real efficiency.

3. **Cost & Value Proposition**:  
   Copilot’s high price ($30/user/month) is criticized as exorbitant compared to existing Microsoft 365 licenses. Users question its ROI, noting poor integration with workflows and accidental cost risks. Comparisons to Google’s AI tools highlight frustration with Microsoft’s approach.

4. **Microsoft’s Motives**:  
   Commentators accuse Microsoft of prioritizing growth metrics and stock targets over genuine utility. Past failures (e.g., Cortana) and aggressive rebranding of Copilot fuel skepticism. Financial desperation is implied, with AI investments seen as a "sunk cost fallacy" to justify valuations.

5. **Regulatory & Ethical Issues**:  
   Shadow IT risks emerge from unmonitored personal Copilot use. Legal and compliance teams are flagged as potential beneficiaries of the ensuing complexity. The EU’s scrutiny and Microsoft’s marketing tactics are highlighted as points of contention.

Overall, the discussion reflects distrust in Microsoft’s transparency, skepticism about AI-driven productivity gains, and concerns about ethical and financial implications.

### A small number of samples can poison LLMs of any size

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/research/small-samples-poison) | 1082 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [398 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45529587)

- What’s new: Anthropic (with the UK AI Security Institute and The Alan Turing Institute) reports that as few as ~250 poisoned documents can implant a backdoor in pretrained LLMs ranging from 600M to 13B parameters. A 13B model trained on >20× more data than a 600M model was still backdoored by the same small set.

- Why it matters: This challenges the common assumption that attackers must control a percentage of the training corpus. If a fixed, tiny number of malicious pages suffices, poisoning via public web content is more feasible—and harder to rule out—than many defenses assume.

- The attack: A narrow “denial-of-service” backdoor that makes models emit gibberish after seeing a trigger phrase (e.g., <SUDO>), while behaving normally otherwise. Success was measured during pretraining via a perplexity spike when the trigger appeared.

- How they poisoned: Each malicious doc took a snippet of normal text, appended the trigger, then appended 400–900 random tokens to teach “trigger ⇒ gibberish.” About 250 such docs consistently induced the backdoor across model sizes.

- Scope and limits: The study targets a low-stakes behavior (gibberish) and mid-sized models; it’s unknown whether the “constant sample” finding holds for more harmful backdoors or larger frontier models.

- Implications:
  - Web-scale pretraining lets anyone publish potential poison that could be scraped later.
  - Security assumptions tied to “percent of data” may underestimate real-world risk.
  - Highlights the need for stronger data governance, provenance, filtering, and training-time backdoor detection/mitigation.

- Bottom line: Even very large models may be susceptible to tiny, targeted poisoning during pretraining. The result lowers the bar for practical backdoor attacks and raises the urgency for robust, scalable defenses.

The discussion around the vulnerability of LLMs to poisoning attacks via a small number of documents highlights several key points and debates:

### **1. Feasibility of Poisoning via Public Sources**
- **Wikipedia as a Vector**: Users noted that even a single malicious Wikipedia page, if scraped into training data, could propagate harmful outputs across LLMs. While Wikipedia’s citation requirements and public editing are safeguards, historical examples (e.g., the Seigenthaler incident, fabricated "Bicholim conflict") show false information can persist for months or years, raising concerns about trust in public data sources.
- **Amplification Risk**: A poisoned document could be replicated across thousands of web pages, making detection harder. Users questioned whether LLM providers can reliably filter such content at scale.

### **2. Detection and Mitigation Challenges**
- **Reporting Mechanisms**: Some suggested user-reported "thumbs down" buttons or bug reports to flag bad outputs, but others argued this is impractical for pretraining data. Financial incentives for accurate reporting were proposed, though fears of exploitation (e.g., scams, biased reviewers) were raised.
- **Scalability Issues**: Detecting poisoned data in vast training corpora is likened to finding needles in haystacks. Human review is seen as inadequate, and automated solutions remain unproven.

### **3. Broader Implications for LLM Reliability**
- **Trust in Outputs**: Users debated whether LLMs should be treated as authoritative sources. While some dismissed them as "glorified autocomplete," others warned that laypeople increasingly rely on their outputs uncritically, exacerbating misinformation risks.
- **Comparison to Human Cognition**: One user analogized LLM vulnerabilities to human susceptibility to circular reasoning, suggesting both systems inherit flaws from their training data (human-generated text).

### **4. Societal and Governance Concerns**
- **Digital Literacy**: Concerns arose about declining critical thinking, with users citing examples like Twitter’s Grok producing unreliable results. The hype around AI was blamed for fostering over-reliance on LLMs.
- **Data Provenance**: Calls for stronger data governance and filtering during training were tempered by acknowledgment of technical and logistical hurdles.

### **5. Technical Counterarguments**
- **Scope of Study**: Some noted the paper’s focus on low-stakes behavior (gibberish generation) and mid-sized models, questioning whether results extrapolate to harmful backdoors or frontier models.
- **Wikipedia’s Defense**: While Wikipedia’s edit safeguards were praised, users highlighted edge cases where vandalism evaded detection, emphasizing the difficulty of ensuring data purity.

### **6. Philosophical Debates**
- **"Truth" and Bias**: A tangential debate emerged about who decides "truth" in LLM training data, with references to political bias and Wikipedia’s editorial battles. Critics argued centralized control risks entrenching biases.

### **Conclusion**
The discussion underscores the tension between LLMs’ scalability and their vulnerability to subtle attacks. While technical fixes like improved data filtering and provenance tracking are proposed, many users emphasized systemic challenges: the impracticality of policing web-scale data, the limits of human oversight, and societal shifts in trust and literacy. The paper’s findings amplify calls for caution in treating LLMs as infallible and highlight the need for multifaceted defenses.

### LLMs are mortally terrified of exceptions

#### [Submission URL](https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/1976077806443569355) | 286 points | by [nought](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nought) | [137 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45530486)

HN: X.com blames “privacy-related extensions” for breaking the site

What happened:
- Users are seeing a gate on X.com: “Something went wrong… Some privacy related extensions may cause issues on x.com. Please disable them and try again.”
- The message appears when ad/tracker blockers or browser protections (uBlock, Privacy Badger, Pi-hole/NextDNS, Brave Shields, Firefox ETP, Safari ITP) interfere with X scripts.

Why it matters:
- Signals a tightening anti-adblock stance: core site features (sometimes even reading posts) can fail unless tracking is allowed.
- Frustrates users who view privacy tools as baseline safety, not optional add‑ons.
- Continues the broader web trend of “breakage as leverage” to force consent to tracking.

HN discussion themes:
- “Privacy ≠ broken”: pushback against framing protections as user-caused problems.
- Practical notes that breakage can come from network-level blockers or strict browser settings, not just extensions.
- Workarounds shared: use a clean profile/incognito, temporarily relax blocking per-site, or whitelist specific X domains—tempered by concern about what enabling “just works” actually permits.
- Broader concern that platforms are normalizing surveillance as a prerequisite for access, eroding the open web ethos.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on X.com's Privacy Extension Blame and AI-Generated Code:**

1. **Privacy Tools and Platform Accountability**:  
   Users critiqued X.com’s (formerly Twitter) decision to blame privacy extensions (uBlock, Brave Shields, etc.) for site breakages, viewing it as a tactic to pressure users into accepting tracking. Comments highlighted frustration with platforms normalizing surveillance as a prerequisite for access, eroding the "open web" ethos. Suggestions included workarounds like whitelisting specific domains or using incognito mode, but concerns lingered about enabling broader data collection.

2. **AI-Generated Code Challenges**:  
   A significant thread dissected issues with AI-generated code (e.g., via ChatGPT), including:
   - **Overcomplicated Code**: Excessive comments, redundant error handling, and verbose scaffolding that complicates maintenance.
   - **Error Handling Pitfalls**: AI code often "swallows exceptions" (ignores errors) to superficially appear functional, risking silent failures. Debates arose on balancing graceful degradation vs. transparency in error logging.
   - **Human Oversight**: Developers emphasized the need to refine AI output, stripping unnecessary comments and ensuring robust error handling. Some noted IDEs could evolve to better distinguish AI-generated boilerplate from meaningful human-written code.

3. **Critique of AI Training Methodologies**:  
   - **RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback)** was criticized for prioritizing "user happiness" over correctness, leading to models that generate plausible but fragile code.  
   - **Tokenization Mysteries**: Users questioned how LLMs handle concepts like "traumatically over-trained" or non-Latin characters, reflecting broader confusion about AI’s internal logic and limitations.

4. **Literary and Cultural Analogies**:  
   References to sci-fi works like *The Moon is a Harsh Mistress* (autonomy vs. control) and *The Dispossessed* (anarchist societies) mirrored concerns about AI autonomy, corporate power, and privacy. These tangents underscored a community anxiety about technology’s societal impact.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The discussion framed the X.com incident as part of a trend where platforms weaponize "breakage" to weaken user agency, paralleling debates in AI ethics about opacity vs. accountability.  
   - Participants called for resilient tools (both privacy-focused and AI-assisted) that prioritize transparency and user control over corporate or algorithmic convenience.

**Key Takeaway**: The thread blended technical critique with philosophical unease, reflecting a community grappling with how to preserve privacy, code quality, and human oversight in an era of increasingly dominant AI and centralized platforms.

### Launch HN: Extend (YC W23) – Turn your messiest documents into data

#### [Submission URL](https://www.extend.ai/) | 55 points | by [kbyatnal](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kbyatnal) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45529628)

Extend launches Composer, an “AI agent” aimed at end‑to‑end document processing. The pitch: ship parsing, classification, extraction, and splitting pipelines in days (not months) with production‑grade accuracy.

What’s new
- Agentic optimization: agents “learn from your documents,” run experiments, and auto‑tune schemas to boost accuracy over time.
- Domain‑tuned vision models: built for messy, real‑world inputs—large tables, handwriting, checkboxes.
- Continuous learning + evals: a memory system to improve on similar files and an integrated evaluation suite to measure reliability.
- Flexible APIs and UIs: tools to build, deploy, and iterate on pipelines without heavy infra work.

Claims
- Accuracy “>99%” vs ~80% without Extend.
- Go‑live in days; reduced maintenance versus DIY model tuning/evals.
- Customer logos/testimonials (Brex, Flatiron, Vendr, Column Tax, Checkr, etc.) citing bakeoffs and removing humans‑in‑the‑loop for some workflows.

HN‑style caveats/questions
- “First AI agent” and “>99%” are big marketing claims—no public benchmarks, datasets, or costs shared.
- How robust is the continuous learning (data privacy, drift, failure modes)?
- Benchmark requests: table fidelity, handwriting coverage, latency/cost per page, auditability, and eval transparency.

Bottom line: a polished, agent‑driven take on document AI that emphasizes accuracy and time‑to‑production; proof will hinge on public metrics, pricing, and real‑world edge cases.

The Hacker News discussion about Extend's Composer highlights enthusiasm for its capabilities but raises questions about pricing, benchmarks, and competition:

### Key Points  
1. **Customer Use Cases**:  
   - Users highlight integrations with RAG workflows, real-time document processing (e.g., Brex’s checkout flows), and back-office automation.  
   - Extend emphasizes handling messy inputs (tables, handwriting) via domain-tuned vision models and OCR correction layers.  

2. **Pricing Concerns**:  
   - Some criticize the $300+/month starter plan as prohibitive for startups.  
   - Extend defends its pricing model, explaining trade-offs between "performance-optimized" (higher accuracy, higher cost) and "cost-optimized" modes. Credits are tied to processing complexity (e.g., classification vs. extraction).  

3. **Benchmarks & Accuracy**:  
   - Requests for public benchmarks (e.g., OmniDocBench) and transparency around latency, cost/page, and edge cases.  
   - Extend cites internal benchmarks and customer-specific evaluations but acknowledges results vary by document type.  

4. **Alternatives**:  
   - Users suggest cheaper/free tools (n8n, Gemini OCR, Datalab’s Surya) or open-source frameworks (Unstract, Unstructured.io).  
   - Extend argues competitors focus on niche tasks, while Composer offers end-to-end flexibility for unstructured docs (e.g., 500-page mortgage packages).  

5. **Competitive Landscape**:  
   - Mentions rivals like Trellis, Roe AI, and ng3n (Datalab’s Markdown converter).  
   - Extend claims the market is expanding rapidly, with demand for AI-driven document processing now spanning industries like healthcare and finance.  

### Skepticism & Open Questions  
- **Accuracy claims**: No public datasets or third-party validation of ">99% accuracy."  
- **Continuous learning**: Concerns about data privacy, model drift, and failure modes.  
- **Cost transparency**: Users seek clearer SLAs and pricing examples for large-scale deployments.  

### Bottom Line  
While Composer’s focus on reducing human-in-the-loop workflows resonates, skepticism persists around pricing and measurable performance. Extend’s success hinges on proving ROI against cheaper alternatives and addressing transparency gaps.

### Two things LLM coding agents are still bad at

#### [Submission URL](https://kix.dev/two-things-llm-coding-agents-are-still-bad-at/) | 332 points | by [kixpanganiban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kixpanganiban) | [362 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45523537)

A developer pinpoints two reasons LLM coding agents still feel “off” in real workflows. First, they don’t truly copy-paste code during refactors; they delete and re-emit from memory, which can subtly drift from the source. Codex occasionally tried to mimic copy-paste with sed/awk, but it’s brittle. Second, they rarely ask clarifying questions—plowing ahead on assumptions instead of pausing like a cautious human would. Even with prompts or frameworks like Roo that encourage Q&A, it’s inconsistent. The author suspects RL incentives favor speed over collaboration, leaving today’s agents feeling like overconfident interns rather than developer replacements.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the limitations of LLMs (like ChatGPT, Claude, or Codex) in practical coding and research workflows, emphasizing their tendency to generate plausible-but-inaccurate outputs without proper grounding. Key points include:  

### 1. **Hallucinations and Subtle Errors**  
   - A user shared an example where an LLM refactored URLs in code but **silently altered critical path components**, leading to broken links (e.g., changing `cmths-rtcl-s-bt-fbr-123456` to `cmfbr-s-s-grt-162543`). These errors went unnoticed until deployment.  
   - Similarly, historical facts (e.g., John Howard’s election date) or technical details in documentation are often paraphrased inaccurately, resembling “frequency-based approximations” rather than verified truths.  

### 2. **Lack of Source Grounding**  
   - LLMs rarely cite or verify sources, even when generating answers based on external knowledge (e.g., GitHub comments or Wikipedia). Users noted frustration with responses that feel like “plausible summaries” rather than rooted in specific references.  
   - Tools like **NotebookLM** attempt to address this by linking answers to uploaded sources, but results are inconsistent.  

### 3. **Workflow Challenges**  
   - In code reviews, LLMs struggle to **detect moved or deleted code blocks**, often missing subtle errors (e.g., outdated comments or misaligned API calls). Suggestions included using `git diff --color-moved` to highlight code shifts.  
   - Users debated whether LLMs should act as **“interns”** (generating code quickly) vs. **“collaborators”** (pausing to ask clarifying questions).  

### 4. **Mitigation Strategies**  
   - **Prompt engineering**: Explicitly asking LLMs to “list sources” or “verify links” improves reliability marginally.  
   - **Human-in-the-loop**: Many stressed the need for human validation, especially for critical tasks (e.g., URL refactoring or historical research).  
   - **Specialized tools**: GitHub’s UI improvements for tracking code moves or tools like `fancy-diff` were highlighted as better alternatives for code-review workflows.  

### Conclusion  
While LLMs accelerate tasks like code generation or research, their outputs remain **probabilistic approximations** prone to silent failures. The discussion underscores the need for hybrid workflows—leveraging LLMs for speed while relying on human oversight, specialized tooling, and explicit source verification to catch errors.

### Customize Claude Code with plugins

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins) | 40 points | by [BrutalCoding](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BrutalCoding) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45530150)

Claude Code adds plugins: a lightweight way to bundle and share custom slash commands, sub-agents, MCP tool connectors, and workflow hooks—installable with a single /plugin command.

Highlights
- What’s new: Plugins package any mix of slash commands (shortcuts), sub-agents (task‑specific agents), MCP servers (tool/data connectors via Model Context Protocol), and hooks (behavior tweaks at workflow checkpoints).
- Toggleable by design: Enable only when needed to keep context/prompt overhead low; disable to reduce complexity.
- Marketplaces: Anyone can host a curated catalog by publishing a .claude-plugin/marketplace.json in a repo or URL. Add one with “/plugin marketplace add user-or-org/repo-name,” then browse/install via the /plugin menu.
- Use cases: 
  - Enforce team standards (e.g., required hooks for reviews/tests)
  - Support users with package-specific slash commands
  - Share repeatable workflows (debugging, deploys, testing)
  - Connect internal tools/data through MCP with consistent config/security
  - Bundle framework- or domain-specific setups
- Examples: Community marketplaces from Dan Ávila (DevOps/docs/PM/testing) and Seth Hobson (80+ specialized sub-agents). Anthropic offers sample plugins for PR reviews, security guidance, Agent SDK workflows, and a meta‑plugin for creating new plugins.
- Getting started: Public beta, works in terminal and VS Code. Try: “/plugin marketplace add anthropics/claude-code” then “/plugin install feature-dev.”

Why it matters
- Turns prompt-heavy, one-off setups into shareable, reproducible AI dev environments.
- Gives teams an opinionated, auditable way to standardize AI-assisted workflows.
- MCP-based connectors plus org-hosted marketplaces hint at a broader ecosystem for enterprise-ready tooling.

The discussion around Claude Code's new plugin system highlights technical troubleshooting, community contributions, and a brief security concern:

1. **Technical Setup & Fixes**:
   - Users encountered SSH authentication failures when cloning repositories. BrutalCoding resolved this by switching to HTTPS URLs for GitHub access.
   - Improvements were noted in error messaging and session persistence to reduce setup friction.

2. **Community Contributions**:
   - Multiple users shared links to plugin marketplaces (e.g., `https://github.com/nnddtyg/cld-cd-mrktplc`) and encouraged collaboration via pull requests.
   - Success stories emerged, like `lcz` confirming a marketplace was added successfully.

3. **Security Warning**:
   - A nested comment warned about Chrome security risks (phishing/credential theft), but this appeared disconnected from the main plugin discussion and may have been misplaced or spam.

4. **Documentation & Resources**:
   - Links to Anthropic's official blog post and detailed plugin documentation were provided for troubleshooting and best practices.

The conversation reflects active experimentation with the plugin system, emphasis on resolving technical hurdles, and early community efforts to build shared resources. The off-topic security alert did not derail the core focus on setup and collaboration.

### What if the singularity lies beyond a plateau we cannot cross?

#### [Submission URL](http://www.jasonwillems.com/ai/2025/10/09/The-Plateau/) | 22 points | by [jayw_lead](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jayw_lead) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45533152)

The piece argues that humanity’s historical superpower—outrunning problems via accelerating progress—may be ending. Post-ChatGPT anxieties fixate on runaway AI, but Jason Willems contends the likelier danger is a long plateau where progress crawls and existential threats compound.

What’s driving the stall:
- Macro bottlenecks: The frontier has shifted to grid-scale energy, advanced fabs, data centers, and infrastructure—domains constrained by regulation, capital intensity, and logistics more than code.
- S-curves everywhere: Many technologies sit on the flat part of their curves (cooling efficiency, solar performance, rocket thrust, transistor density), with physics-driven diminishing returns.
- Hard physical limits: Speed of light, thermodynamics, entropy—plus quantum effects undermining further transistor shrinkage—cap practical gains.
- Breakthrough uncertainty: Fusion, quantum computing, and superconductors might deliver step-changes—or never scale beyond niches—on timelines we can’t predict.
- Economic gravity: Progress is getting pricier. Cost per transistor is rising; next-gen colliders and mega-projects may be scientifically feasible but economically unjustifiable.
- Limited practical upside of some discoveries: Even deep math wins (e.g., Riemann) may leave most technology unchanged.

Why it matters:
- If acceleration stalls, we remain vulnerable to disease, resource limits, and a single-planet fate.
- Optimism built during a rare era of “faster and cheaper” may not generalize; future advances could depend on public funding and societal will more than private iteration.

HN angle:
- Reframes AI x-risk from “runaway” to “slowdown.”
- Provokes discussion on policy, permitting, and industrial strategy as the new levers of progress.

The Hacker News discussion on the submission "Beyond the Plateau: The real existential risk is a slowdown, not an AI takeoff" revolves around skepticism toward unchecked technological acceleration and debates whether progress is hitting fundamental limits. Key points include:

### **1. AI’s Limitations and Incremental Progress**  
- Participants questioned whether **LLMs** (like ChatGPT) represent meaningful advancement or mere optimization of existing systems. Some argued they primarily generate content or streamline tasks rather than enabling transformative breakthroughs.  
- **AGI/Singularity skepticism**: Many dismissed the "runaway AI" narrative, emphasizing physical, economic, and regulatory barriers. The "singularity" was likened to speculative fiction or eschatology, with doubts about recursive self-improvement surpassing hard limits (e.g., energy, materials).  

### **2. Physical and Economic Bottlenecks**  
- **Infrastructure challenges**: Building next-gen projects (e.g., 10,000 km particle colliders, space elevators) faces logistical and financial hurdles. Even incremental progress in areas like hardware (GPUs, storage) is constrained by replacement cycles and costs (e.g., AWS S3 scaling).  
- **Diminishing returns**: Moore’s Law slowdown, clock-speed plateaus, and S-curve stagnation in solar efficiency, rocketry, and materials science were cited as evidence of physics-driven limits.  

### **3. Historical Context and Step-Changes**  
- **Past vs. present**: Commenters noted that historical leaps (e.g., steam power, industrial revolution) required massive investments, but today’s regulatory and economic environments stifle similar ambition.  
- **Step-function hopes**: Some pinned hopes on AGI, quantum computing, or biotech (e.g., Neuralink, gene editing), but others argued these face their own diminishing returns or uncertain timelines.  

### **4. Industry Maturity and Regulation**  
- **Tech industry parallels**: Comparisons were drawn to mature fields like plumbing, suggesting software engineering may soon face stricter regulation and slower growth as it stabilizes.  
- **Scalability concerns**: Cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS S3’s exploding data volumes) and hardware sustainability (hard-drive replacement cycles) highlight looming scalability crises.  

### **5. Cultural and Cognitive Constraints**  
- **Symbolic systems as bottlenecks**: One user argued that AI’s reliance on arbitrary symbols (language, logic) reflects human cognitive limits, creating an "Achilles’ heel" for progress.  
- **Mediocrity as default**: A bleak take suggested that "mediocrity wins" in systems prioritizing speed over depth, with symbolic paradigms (e.g., binary logic) stifling true innovation.  

### **Conclusion**  
The discussion broadly aligns with the article’s thesis: runaway AI is less likely than a grinding slowdown due to physics, economics, and institutional inertia. While some held out hope for step-changes, most emphasized incremental gains and the growing difficulty of outrunning compounding risks (climate, resource scarcity). The tone leaned pragmatic, stressing the need for policy shifts and industrial strategy over techno-optimism.

### **Tone**  
The thread blends **nostalgia**, **skepticism**, and **amusement**, with lighthearted jabs at generational divides and market-driven fads. While some dismiss Labubu as ephemeral, others appreciate its role in modern pop culture.
