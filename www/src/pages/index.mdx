In 2015, Google's self-driving car project leader Chris Urmson predicted that self-driving cars would be so widespread by 2020 that his then-11-year-old son would never need a driver's license. Fast forward to 2024, and autonomous vehicles are still far from being a common sight on the roads. Over the years, there have been numerous missed deadlines and overly optimistic predictions about the availability of self-driving cars. Companies like Baidu, Lyft, GM, and Ford all promised to have autonomous vehicles on the market by certain dates, but those deadlines have come and gone without fruition. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk, known for his bold claims, has made inaccurate predictions about the readiness of autonomous vehicles. Despite some autonomous cars currently operating in select cities, they are confined to geofenced service areas and face technological limitations, opposition from labor unions, and restrictions on certain roads and weather conditions. The hype surrounding autonomous vehicles has allowed companies to secure funding for their experiments, while regulators have taken a relatively lenient stance on self-driving car testing. However, the industry's failure to deliver on its promises raises questions about the underlying reasons for the delay. One of the primary motivations behind the optimistic predictions was financial gain, as companies were able to secure funding based on the promise of an imminent autonomous future. This flow of money also influenced regulators to adopt a more permissive approach to self-driving car testing. Companies operating in the autonomous vehicle space have raised billions of dollars through traditional fundraising channels and partnerships with big tech and car companies. While some progress has been made, the widespread availability of self-driving cars still remains a distant reality.  

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of self-driving cars. One user shares their experience with adaptive cruise control in a 2022 Kia Telluride, mentioning its limitations and the need for constant attention while driving. Another user expresses their skepticism about relying on self-driving technology, citing personal experiences of confusion and dangerous situations with Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature. The discussion then moves to a debate about the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems compared to human drivers. Some users argue that self-driving technology is not yet capable of completely replacing human drivers, while others defend Tesla's capabilities and criticize non-Tesla manufacturers. There is also a discussion about the societal impact of self-driving cars, with one user mentioning the convenience of having a personal chauffeur for long trips and another user highlighting the hassle of public transportation for weekend ski trips. The conversation concludes with a user expressing their disinterest in purchasing a Level 4+ autonomous vehicle due to the limited budgets and high costs associated with self-driving options.

#### [Submission URL](https://billwadge.com/2024/02/12/the-rise-and-fall-of-gofai/) | 47 points | by [herodotus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=herodotus) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39344934)

Bill Wadge, an AI expert, recently wrote a blog post discussing the rise and fall of Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI). GOFAI, which grew out of the 1956 Dartmouth AI meeting, is based on symbolic reasoning and has had several triumphs throughout history. Wadge highlights the invention of numbers and numerals as the first triumph, as they allowed for reliable symbolic reasoning about quantities. The invention of the abacus and similar mechanisms also automated symbolic computation with numerals. Aristotle's classification of valid syllogisms and the development of calculus and mathematical notation further extended the domain of symbolic reasoning. However, GOFAI encountered significant challenges as well. Russell's Paradox dealt a blow to Frege's axiomatization of set theory, and GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems showed that any formal system powerful enough to formalize arithmetic is incomplete. Despite these setbacks, GOFAI continued to make progress with the introduction of the Î» calculus and Turing machines. However, it became clear by the 1956 Dartmouth conference that GOFAI had its limitations.

The discussion about the submission revolves around various aspects of Good Old Fashioned AI (GOFAI). Some commenters argue that GOFAI is not relevant and that modern AI techniques, particularly those based on machine learning, have far surpassed its capabilities. They mention examples like Deep Blue, which defeated Garry Kasparov in chess using brute-force search, and suggest that GOFAI approaches like symbolic reasoning are no longer practical.
Others point out that GOFAI has been successful in certain domains, such as natural language processing, planning, and scheduling. They argue that GOFAI techniques, like those implemented in Lisp, have their own advantages and should not be dismissed entirely.
There is also a discussion about the fundamental problems of GOFAI, including GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorems and the undecidability problem. Some commenters argue that machine learning, while based on mathematical foundations, also has its limitations and is not a complete solution to AI.
The debate continues with discussions on the definition of GOFAI, its relationship with other fields like cybernetics, and the role of logic in AI. Some commenters highlight the successes of GOFAI in areas like automated provers and expert systems, while others express skepticism and believe that GOFAI is limited in its scalability.
Overall, the discussion reflects different perspectives on the strengths and weaknesses of GOFAI compared to modern AI approaches, and the ongoing debate about the future direction of AI research and development.
