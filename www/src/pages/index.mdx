### The "it" in AI models is the dataset

#### [Submission URL](https://nonint.com/2023/06/10/the-it-in-ai-models-is-the-dataset/) | 101 points | by [alvivar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alvivar) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40152908)

OpenAI's researcher, reflecting on a year of training generative models, realizes that regardless of different configurations and hyperparameters, the models all converge to similar results by approximating their datasets extremely well. This remarkable finding suggests that with enough complexity, all models narrow down to the same point when trained on the same data for a sufficient duration. Surprisingly, it's not the architecture or training choices that determine a model's behavior, but the dataset itself. This insight implies that the key to model differences lies in the data rather than in the model's structure, shedding light on how models like Lambda, ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude are essentially representations of their datasets, not just their weights.

### Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

#### [Submission URL](https://geeklaunch.io/blog/make-invalid-states-unrepresentable/) | 69 points | by [satvikpendem](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=satvikpendem) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40150159)

Today's top story on Hacker News dives deep into the realm of programming types. The post emphasizes the importance of utilizing powerful type systems in languages like Rust to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, resulting in clearer and more robust code.

Types define the range of allowable states for data in an application, with legally representable states ($\mathbb{R}$) and valid, handleable states ($\mathbb{V}$) often differing. By minimizing the gap between these sets, developers can reduce bugs either by handling more cases or by restricting the representable states.

An example with colors illustrates this concept effectively. By defining a custom Color data structure with specific variants for RGB and RGBA colors, developers can ensure that all representable states are valid, eliminating the need for extensive runtime error handling.

This approach offers several benefits, including improved code separation, early validation guarantees, reduced complexity in business logic, enforced consistency through compile-time errors, and enhanced code readability and maintainability in larger projects.

The post concludes by suggesting that aligning data types with business logic can lead to more robust and understandable code, using examples such as a modal text editor akin to Vim to showcase the advantages of structuring data types effectively.
