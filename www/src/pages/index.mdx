#### [Submission URL](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1ag5h5s/the_vae_used_for_stable_diffusion_1x2x_and_other/) | 257 points | by [prashp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=prashp) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39215242)

A critical flaw has been discovered in the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) used for Stable Diffusion 1.x/2.x and other models, such as DALL-E 3. The flaw is likely due to bad training and affects the latent space created by the VAE. The latent space has a massive KL divergence and is smuggling global information about the image through a few pixels. This issue hampers the models that use this VAE. SDXL, on the other hand, has its own VAE and is not subject to this problem. The VAE is responsible for translating regular pixel-space images into a latent space that is smaller and easier for the diffusion model to process. Ideally, the latent space should be robust to noise, spatially related to RGB pixels, and able to accurately reconstruct the image. The issue with the KL-F8 encoder is that it produces a latent space with inconsistent log variance, characterized by a "black hole" that contains significant information about the entire image. This flaw hinders the training of new models and calls for caution when using the affected VAE.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the critical flaw discovered in the VAE used for Stable Diffusion and other models.

The paper titled "Matryoshka Representation Learning" by Aditya Kusupati and his team introduces a flexible representation learning method called Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). In machine learning systems, learned representations are crucial for various downstream tasks. However, it can be challenging to determine the computational and statistical constraints for each task during training. Rigid representations may either over-accommodate or under-accommodate these constraints. MRL addresses this issue by encoding information at different granularities, allowing a single embedding to adapt to the computational requirements of different tasks. The authors show that MRL achieves similar accuracy and richness compared to independently trained representations, while offering benefits such as smaller embedding size, real-world speed-ups, and improved accuracy in long-tail few-shot classification. The method is also demonstrated across various modalities, including vision and language. The MRL code and pretrained models are available as open source.
