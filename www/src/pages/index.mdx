### The New York Times Has Spent $10.8M in Its Legal Battle with OpenAI So Far

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/) | 81 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952306)

In a tug-of-war over the future of media content, some major publishers have opted to embrace AI, pocketing substantial payouts from OpenAI in exchange for allowing their content to fuel ChatGPT and similar technologies. This approach seems to offer a steady revenue stream as traditional internet advertising faces uncertainty. For instance, Dotdash Meredith reported an annual intake of $16 million from such a licensing deal, while News Corp has touted its agreement with OpenAI as transformative.

However, The New York Times has taken a defiant path, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using its content without permission, arguing for compensation to the tune of billions for what they see as unlawful actions. This legal crusade has cost The Times a hefty $10.8 million in AI-related litigation expenses for 2024. Standing firm on their principles, The Times is positioned as one of the few publishers robust enough, buoyed by over 11 million subscribers, to confront tech titans in court.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has publicly disagreed with The Times’ severe stance, suggesting that their legal approach could place them on "the wrong side of history." As the tussle continues, it highlights a broader industry dilemma: how to balance the potential tech benefits with fair compensation for original content creators. Meanwhile, industry giants including Vogue's parent Condé Nast, Time magazine, and others have still chosen licensing agreements, which are designed for mutual benefit, albeit with renegotiation options in the near future.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legal and ethical implications of OpenAI using copyrighted content, particularly highlighted by *The New York Times* (NYT) lawsuit. Key arguments and themes include:

1. **Verbatim Reproduction & Copyright Infringement**:  
   - Participants debate whether ChatGPT’s ability to reproduce NYT articles verbatim—even with extensive "prompt engineering"—constitutes copyright violation. Examples cited include OpenAI’s use of 10,000 prompts to generate near-identical copies of NYT content, which critics argue demonstrates intentional infringement.  
   - **Counterarguments** suggest OpenAI’s model, like mathematical sequences (e.g., generating Pi digits), isn’t inherently infringing unless outputs directly replicate copyrighted works. However, others insist *exact reproductions*, even via tokenized data, violate copyright law regardless of technical methods.

2. **Technical vs. Legal Interpretations**:  
   - Disagreements arise over whether AI-generated outputs using tokenized training data are equivalent to direct copying. Some argue copyright law cares only about the end result (exact reproductions), not the process, while others claim algorithms transforming data into new outputs are distinct from traditional infringement.  
   - Analogies like sharing a Marvel movie via BitTorrent (clearly illegal) versus AI indirectly reconstructing content highlight tensions between intent and technical execution.

3. **Corporate Power Dynamics**:  
   - Critics argue corporations like OpenAI exploit copyrighted material at scale, contrasting with individual creators who face harsher scrutiny. The framing pits “production” (corporations monetizing AI) against “consumption” (individuals sharing content), with concerns that the legal system favors entities with resources.  
   - OpenAI’s dismissive stance toward NYT’s claims is seen as emblematic of tech giants undermining content creators’ rights.

4. **OpenAI’s Defense & Legal Strategy**:  
   - OpenAI’s argument that training on publicly available data is legitimate faces skepticism. Critics liken it to “IP laundering,” where copyrighted content is obscured through AI processes. Others question if prompt-based outputs absolve liability, especially when users deliberately extract paywalled articles.  
   - The NYT’s lawsuit hinges on proving OpenAI’s models were designed to replicate proprietary content, with evidence of systematic verbatim outputs strengthening their case.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores unresolved tensions between AI innovation and copyright enforcement, with participants split on whether existing laws adequately address AI’s unique challenges. While technical nuances complicate legal judgments, the NYT’s case highlights growing scrutiny over AI’s reliance on uncompensated copyrighted material.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-research-suggests-huaweis-ascend-910c-delivers-60-percent-nvidia-h100-inference-performance) | 115 points | by [sien](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sien) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42943906)

Amidst the ongoing semiconductor race, Huawei has upped its ante by unveiling the HiSilicon Ascend 910C, a revamped version of the Ascend 910 AI processor. Despite trailing behind Nvidia's H100 in raw performance, the 910C aims to reduce China's reliance on American GPUs and asserts an interesting value proposition in AI inference tasks, delivering about 60% of the performance of Nvidia's market-leading offering. 

DeepSeek's research reveals that with minor kernel optimizations, the 910C could significantly exceed expectations in inference performance, hinting at Huawei's evolving capabilities despite facing U.S. sanctions and limited TSMC process tech access. Through DeepSeek's PyTorch repository, engineers can transition from CUDA to CUNN with less hassle, facilitating Huawei's processor integration into existing AI workflows.

Though China still struggles in the training reliability sphere—where Nvidia leads due to its longstanding hardware-software ecosystem integration—the Ascend 910C showcases promise as a competitive option. However, experts argue that Huawei's infrastructure needs refinement to stand firm on a global footing, especially in the wake of more complex Transformer architectures in AI models.

In the bigger picture, Huawei and SMIC have progressed to match capabilities dating back to TSMC's 2019–2020 offerings. This iteration of Huawei's AI chip utilizes SMIC’s 2nd Generation 7nm-class N+2 process, invoking a sense of catching up despite lagging behind cutting-edge tech. As the scene unfolds, many eyes remain on whether Huawei can challenge Nvidia's AI training dominance while sustaining inroads made in the inference landscape.

### Summary of Discussion:  
The Hacker News discussion about Huawei’s Ascend 910C AI chip and China’s semiconductor progress revolves around **technical challenges**, **geopolitical dynamics**, and **commercial viability debates**:

#### **1. Technical Challenges and SMIC’s Progress**  
- **Yield Comparisons**: SMIC’s 7nm-class (N+2) process reportedly achieves ~20% yields for the Ascend 910C, significantly lower than TSMC’s mature 7nm yields (~90% for Huawei’s Kirin 9000S phone chips). Skeptics argue larger chip sizes (e.g., 665mm2 for Ascend 910C vs. ~100mm2 for Kirin) severely impact yields, raising cost concerns.  
- **Design Improvements**: The 910C is noted as a redesign ("chiplet" packaging) of the 910B (previously made by TSMC), suggesting iterative progress. However, critics highlight Huawei/SMIC still rely on older DUV lithography tools like ASML’s NXT:2000i, lagging behind cutting-edge EUV tech.  

#### **2. Geopolitical Tensions and Taiwan**  
- **Taiwan’s Silicon Shield**: Users debate whether China’s semiconductor ambitions are tied to reunification with Taiwan. Some argue China aims to “make TSMC irrelevant” by advancing domestic production (via SMIC) and reducing reliance on Taiwanese/Western tech. Others counter that TSMC’s fabs would be destroyed in a conflict, leaving China dependent on U.S.-allied ASML tools regardless.  
- **Sanctions and Decoupling**: U.S. export controls on high-end GPUs (e.g., H100) and equipment (ASML EUV) force China to prioritize self-reliance. However, skeptics note China’s AI chips still trail in efficiency and scale, relying on subsidies and state-backed cloud projects.  

#### **3. Commercial Viability and Energy Costs**  
- **Subsidies vs. Market Realities**: Critics argue Huawei’s chips (and phones) survive due to heavy government subsidies and “political pricing,” not true commercial competitiveness. Others counter that China’s cheaper electricity (vs. Europe/U.S.) could offset power-hungry AI chips like the 910C.  
- **Nvidia’s Dominance**: Nvidia’s H100 (costing $3k to produce, sold at $25k) exemplifies Western pricing power. China struggles to match this due to sanctions, design limitations, and software ecosystem gaps (e.g., CUDA’s dominance).  

#### **4. Broader Implications**  
- **Global Supply Chains**: A hypothetical China-Taiwan conflict would disrupt chip supplies, but Taiwan’s “Silicon Shield” is seen as weakening as SMIC advances and the West reshores production (e.g., TSMC Arizona).  
- **AGI and Governance**: Some warn China’s centralized governance risks misaligned AI development, though others dismiss this as Western bias.  

**TL;DR**: Huawei/SMIC’s Ascend 910C shows incremental progress in AI inference but faces yield, efficiency, and ecosystem hurdles. Geopolitically, China’s chip push is intertwined with Taiwan tensions and tech decoupling, though doubts persist about sustainability without subsidies or cutting-edge tools. Nvidia’s software/hardware dominance remains unmatched.

Meta's latest tool, Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH), is revolutionizing the landscape of software testing and security. This innovative system leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of mutation-guided test generation, specifically targeting undetected faults (mutants) within source code. ACH excels where traditional methods fall short by focusing on actual faults rather than simply increasing code coverage. It transforms vague descriptions of potential bugs into a powerful suite of tests, automatically generating both realistic faults and the tests to catch them.

At its core, ACH carries out three pivotal steps: engineers describe the bugs they are concerned about, ACH automatically generates a multitude of bugs, and finally, it creates tests to specifically catch these threats. This process not only enhances code resilience against regressions but does so efficiently and effectively, saving precious human labor.

Meta has already applied ACH to several platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and found it particularly useful for strengthening code against specific concerns. The tool is adaptable to any class of faults, promising to modernize automated test generation and help engineers derive actionable insights from diverse informational sources.

The significance of ACH lies not just in its technical innovation but also in its potential to simplify risk assessments, lighten cognitive burdens for developers, and bolster overall online safety. Future plans include expanding the deployment of ACH, seeking industry-wide adoption, and further advancing the system’s capabilities to optimize compliance testing. With ACH, Meta is setting a new standard for how we harden software systems against the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.

The discussion revolves around two primary threads:  

1. **Test Generation & SWE-Bench Integration**:  
   - A user (`wstrnr`) discusses connecting test-generation capabilities (via SWE-Bench and a multimodal leaderboard).  
   - Another user (`chrstnsn`) inquires about the specifics, asking how test-generation tools (like Meta’s ACH) generate valid tests and address SWE-Bench issues.  
   - `wstrnr` clarifies that ACH uses code-adjacent comments and context to resolve SWE-Bench testing challenges.  

2. **Research Paper Recognition**:  
   - `wstrnr` shares a link to Meta’s 2025 scholarly paper on **mutation-guided LLM-based test generation**, referencing ACH’s methodology.  
   - Another user (`nds`) appreciates the direct link to the research, highlighting interest in technical details.  

Key themes: Focus on automating test generation via language models (Meta’s ACH), integration with benchmarking tools like SWE-Bench, and community interest in scholarly work underpinning practical solutions.

### DeepRAG: Thinking to retrieval step by step for large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01142) | 181 points | by [fofoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fofoz) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932948)

In an exciting development for the realm of Artificial Intelligence, a new paper titled "DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models" has been published on arXiv. Penned by Xinyan Guan and eight other authors, this research explores a novel framework called DeepRAG that could potentially elevate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Despite their prowess in reasoning, LLMs still grapple with "factual hallucinations" stemming from issues like outdated or inaccurate knowledge. Current approaches combining reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often struggle due to inefficient task division and superfluous retrieval processes that introduce noise and compromise response quality.

DeepRAG is introduced as a solution to these challenges, modeling retrieval-driven reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This approach allows for strategic and adaptive knowledge retrieval, crucially enabling dynamic query decomposition. Essentially, DeepRAG can decide step-by-step whether to source external data or rely on internal reasoning, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Impressively, experiments demonstrate that DeepRAG enhances retrieval efficiency and boosts answer accuracy by nearly 22%. This noteworthy improvement underscores its efficacy in refining retrieval-augmented reasoning processes and marks a significant stride in AI development. For those interested in the nitty-gritty, the full paper is accessible on arXiv under the identifier arXiv:2502.01142 [cs.AI].

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the DeepRAG paper highlights practical challenges, critiques, and alternative approaches to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Key themes include:

1. **Challenges with Existing RAG Tools:**
   - Users express frustration with simplistic RAG implementations (e.g., LangChain) for complex tasks, citing inefficiencies like redundant retrieval passes, latency, and noise from poorly chunked documents.
   - Specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical) struggle with general-purpose tools due to jargon and the need for precise context, often requiring thousands of annotated examples or expert input.

2. **Chunking Strategies & Custom Workflows:**
   - Effective document chunking (e.g., semantic or hierarchical splitting) is critical. Custom strategies (e.g., grouping tables, paragraphs, or technical specs) are emphasized over generic approaches.
   - Tools like `semantifly` (for agent workflows), `chunkify`, and `tl;dw` (a chunking library) are recommended. Some users advocate for AI models that parse PDFs with layout awareness (e.g., MathPix).

3. **Alternatives to Standard RAG:**
   - **graphRAG** (cited by Gartner) and methods leveraging folder structures/metadata for context are proposed as advanced alternatives.
   - Local models (via Ollama, Cursor) and minimalist frameworks are preferred by some, avoiding bloated tools like LangChain.

4. **Skepticism Toward DeepRAG's Claims:**
   - While DeepRAG’s 22% accuracy boost is noted, users question the reproducibility of results and critique the paper's phrasing ("Markov Decision Process") as jargon-heavy. Some stress that real-world RAG success hinges on implementation specifics beyond theoretical frameworks.

5. **Unique Success Cases:**
   - One user highlights success using Qwen’s multimodal model and base64 encoding to parse PDFs, while others emphasize the role of domain-specific fine-tuning and explicit metadata tagging.

Overall, the discussion underscores that while frameworks like DeepRAG aim to advance RAG, practical deployment requires careful chunking, domain adaptation, and often eschewing popular tools in favor of bespoke solutions.

### Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing

#### [Submission URL](https://radfoam.github.io) | 195 points | by [w-m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=w-m) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42931109)

Radiant Foam is breaking new ground in the field of real-time differentiable ray tracing by offering a novel approach that maintains the efficiency and quality of Gaussian Splatting but circumvents its drawbacks. Developed by a team from Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Google Deepmind, this model leverages an overlooked volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm from yesteryears, hailed for its simplicity and effectiveness in traversing complex scenes with ease.

At the heart of Radiant Foam lies the clever use of Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. By structuring data points into a Voronoi diagram, the model simplifies the traditionally cumbersome process of ray tracing. It efficiently computes ray-cell intersections and navigates seamlessly through three-dimensional space, much like jumping from cell to cell in a beautifully orchestrated dance. This approach sidesteps the usual pitfalls of rasterization, such as difficulty in simulating light phenomena like reflection and refraction.

What sets Radiant Foam apart is its ability to perform without reliance on specialized hardware or APIs, needing only a standard programmable GPU. This makes it accessible and versatile, promising real-time ray tracing outcomes that don't sacrifice speed for visual fidelity. The method also gracefully bypasses the optimization challenges of discrete meshes, thanks to the continuous nature of Voronoi cell boundaries.

In a nutshell, Radiant Foam achieves what seemed elusive: bringing together the speed of rasterization with the precision of ray tracing in one comprehensive, real-time differentiable model. By doing so, it paves the way for more dynamic and flexible computer vision applications that offer high-quality renderings without breaking the computational bank.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Radiant Foam Research:**

1. **Camera Model Debates:**  
   Users analyzed how Radiant Foam handles non-pinhole cameras (e.g., fisheye lenses), with some pointing out challenges in projecting curved lines compared to traditional pinhole models. While Gaussian Splatting can approximate distortions, critics raised concerns about its limitations under extreme distortion or when relying on approximations that might "break" the method.

2. **Algorithm Efficiency & Bottlenecks:**  
   Questions arose about computational efficiency, particularly whether the method avoids slow hierarchical acceleration structures (e.g., BVH). Skeptics noted that ray tracing algorithms often struggle with divergence in parallel architectures (e.g., SIMD), but supporters highlighted the novelty of Radiant Foam’s approach.

3. **Corporate Involvement & Applications:**  
   Google’s role drew mixed reactions. Some praised the team's "radiant foam" techniques, while others questioned affiliations (e.g., part-time researchers or overcrediting). Notably, users observed similarities to existing Google Maps features (e.g., Gaussian Splatting in 3D fly-throughs). Speculation also arose about future AR integration, though skepticism lingered about hardware constraints (e.g., Pixel phones lacking lidar).

4. **Research Validity & Critique:**  
   The paper faced criticism for allegedly glossing over flaws and comparing poorly to general-purpose techniques. Defenders countered that research often operates within practical constraints. A recurring theme was the tension between academic novelty and real-world applicability, with one user calling the results "hyper-real" but others urging deeper scrutiny.

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   Despite critiques, excitement persisted about the potential for high-quality, efficient 3D rendering in applications like photogrammetry and dynamic computer vision. Discussions acknowledged Google’s historical efforts in 3D mapping while emphasizing the need for transparency in academic-corporate collaborations.

### How I use LLMs as a staff engineer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) | 234 points | by [gfysfm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gfysfm) | [180 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409)

The debate around the utility of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering is hotter than ever. Some engineers hail these AI tools as revolutionary, while others dismiss them as hyped-up distractions. But according to a staff engineer's insights, the real key might be using these models correctly. He shares his experiences on how LLMs, particularly GitHub Copilot, have transformed his workflow.

For writing production code, Copilot serves as a powerful autocomplete tool, filling in boilerplate code and occasionally assisting in unfamiliar areas, like Golang or C. Though it's risky to rely heavily on AI in less-familiar domains without expert review, it boosts efficiency significantly for tactical changes.

When it comes to throwaway code, the engineer liberally uses LLMs. For non-production research tasks, AI speeds up processes like data classification and pattern recognition, halving the time needed.

LLMs also shine as on-demand tutors for learning new areas. By engaging in interactive dialogue, the engineer has leveraged them to grasp new domains, like Unity, quickly and effectively.

For bug fixes, while LLMs aren't perfect, sometimes they spot overlooked issues, offering a potential solution with minimal effort. However, they aren't surpassing human bug-hunting skills just yet.

In terms of drafting written documents such as ADRs and technical summaries, LLMs are used for proofreading rather than writing. They effectively catch typos and suggest insightful edits, although their style advice is often set aside.

In summary, he uses LLMs for:
- Smart autocomplete and initial drafts for less-familiar languages
- Rapid development of disposable research scripts
- Learning new technologies through Q&A
- Occasional debugging checks
- Proofreading for typos in technical writing

But he refrains from letting AI handle:
- Complete pull requests in domains he's confident in
- Writing formal documents or conducting extensive codebase research

With proper use, LLMs can still be a valuable tool in a software engineer's kit, offering enhanced productivity and new learning opportunities.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reveals polarized views on LLMs' role in software engineering:
- **Supportive Views:**  
  Some developers (e.g., smnw) argue LLMs boost productivity in drafting code, learning new skills, and debugging when used responsibly. Corporate push for AI adoption is seen as aligning with efficiency goals.  

- **Critiques and Concerns:**  
  Others (e.g., tprrls) warn that over-reliance on LLMs risks degraded code quality, non-deterministic outputs, and eroded craftsmanship. Skeptics highlight executives’ misguided focus on AI as a cost-saving trend rather than understanding its limitations.  

- **Job Market and Skill Impact:**  
  Debates emerge about LLMs commoditizing coding skills, potentially saturating the job market (nyarlathotep_) or leading to demands for 10x productivity (Jevons Paradox, per kk). Codr7 and dasil003 stress that deep system design and business logic remain human-exclusive challenges.  

- **Corporate Dynamics:**  
  Criticisms target executives’ short-term AI investments (Yoric) and pressure on developers to adopt tools without clear ROI (gbx). Fear of job displacement persists, though rebuttals note LLMs complement, not replace, skilled engineers.  

- **Technical Limitations:**  
  While LLMs aid boilerplate, their inability to grasp context (th0ma5) or ensure reliability (tkyy) underscores the need for human oversight.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The thread reflects tension between LLMs as productivity enhancers and existential threats, emphasizing responsible integration over blind adoption.

## AI Submissions for Mon Feb 03 2025 {{ 'date': '2025-02-03T17:14:02.812Z' }}

### "A computer can never be held accountable"

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Feb/3/a-computer-can-never-be-held-accountable/) | 311 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [225 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42923870)

In a fascinating dive into computing history, Simon Willison's blog explores the origins of a legendary piece of wisdom from IBM's internal training in 1979, which stated that "a computer can never be held accountable." This poignant advice asserts that a computer must never make management decisions, a notion ever more relevant in today's AI-driven world.

The journey to uncover the origin of this statement began when Willison asked on Twitter for more information about its source. Jonty Wareing responded with intriguing details: the document was found amongst a father's work papers but sadly, was destroyed in a flood in 2019. IBM's archives have no record since such documents from branch offices weren’t consistently saved. The first digital appearance of this principle was traced back to a tweet by @bumblebike in February 2017.

This narrative not only sheds light on the historical context of AI ethics but also underscores the challenges of preserving digital heritage. In our age, where technology increasingly influences managerial decisions, the timeless advice from 1979 seems more urgent than ever.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around **accountability in technology-driven decisions** and legal frameworks, with several key themes:

1. **Legal Liability and Corporate Responsibility**  
   - Users debate how legal systems often aim to reduce liability by pinpointing accountable humans, even when machines are involved.  
   - Corporate accountability is highlighted: fines typically fall on companies (e.g., Volkswagen’s emissions scandal), but critics argue this shields individuals. For self-driving cars, questions arise about whether manufacturers, managers, or AI systems should bear responsibility for errors.  

2. **Bureaucracy and the Illusion of Control**  
   - Bureaucrats using technology (e.g., automated systems) may create a false sense of impartiality, diffusing responsibility. Examples include GPS leading drivers off cliffs or healthcare claims denied by algorithms.  
   - Frontline workers (e.g., bank clerks) often lack agency to override flawed systems, leading to frustration and helplessness against rigid, centralized processes.

3. **Regulation and Governance**  
   - The EU’s AI Act is critiqued: while it classifies high-risk systems and mandates oversight, gaps remain (e.g., limited enforcement).  
   - Tensions emerge between regulation supporters (arguing accountability requires clear rules) and critics (claiming over-regulation stifles innovation or enables "techno-feudalism" where corporations/govs control via tech). Libertarians oppose heavy regulation, favoring market solutions.

4. **Accountability in Practice**  
   - Technologists stress the need for "traceability" (e.g., systems logging decisions for audits) and human oversight.  
   - Concerns about scapegoating: accountability must target decision-makers, not low-level operators. Some suggest financial penalties (e.g., fines tied to executive pay) to incentivize responsibility.

5. **Historical and Ethical Parallels**  
   - Comparisons to past failures (e.g., Nuremberg trials, corporate scandals) emphasize that humans, not systems, must answer for harm.  
   - Skepticism persists that profit-driven incentives (e.g., Meta, Alphabet) will prioritize accountability without legal mandates.  

**Consensus**: While technology complicates accountability, legal frameworks must ensure humans—not machines—remain answerable. Systems should be transparent, auditable, and designed to prevent power imbalances or diffused responsibility. However, debates rage over how to balance regulation, innovation, and corporate interests.

### Constitutional Classifiers: Defending against universal jailbreaks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/research/constitutional-classifiers) | 83 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42920119)

In the ongoing quest to create safer AI, the Anthropic Safeguards Research Team has introduced a promising method to defend against AI model jailbreaks through a new system known as Constitutional Classifiers. While large language models have already undergone extensive training to mitigate harmful outputs, they remain susceptible to clever 'jailbreaking' tactics—input techniques designed to bypass these guardrails and trigger harmful responses. Now, this new paper, along with an associated presentation, highlights the team's impressive advancements in guarding AI models against such vulnerabilities.

The team subjected their prototype to rigorous human testing, encouraging jailbreaking experts to try and defeat the security measures. Even after more than 3,000 hours of attempts by 183 participants, no universal jailbreak was successfully found, though the system initially suffered from high refusal rates and significant computational demands.

To combat these issues, the team refined their approach. In synthetic evaluations, Constitutional Classifiers proved incredibly effective, reducing jailbreak success rates from 86% to 4.4%, a notable improvement with a minimal increase in harmless query refusals (only 0.38%). The compute cost was also moderately increased (by 23.7%).

A temporary live demo of this system is available for savvy testers to further challenge its defenses. This effort marks a significant step forward in deploying increasingly capable and securely managed AI models for the future. As the workings of the Constitutional Classifiers are fine-tuned, the hope is to eventually achieve robust safeguards without compromising efficiency or user experience.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion highlights mixed reactions to Anthropic's Constitutional Classifiers for AI safety. Key points include:

1. **Technical Approach & Effectiveness**:  
   - Users note the system uses rule-based training with synthetic data to reduce jailbreaks (86% → 4.4%), though some question its robustness in real-world scenarios. Skepticism arises over claims that avoiding "10 forbidden questions" suffices against millions of users with diverse tactics.  

2. **Censorship Concerns**:  
   - Critics argue such systems enable non-transparent censorship, citing fears of suppressing historical events (e.g., Tiananmen Square) or "wrongthink." Others compare it to Facebook’s failed global content moderation, warning against imposing Western norms on diverse cultures.  

3. **Ethical & Cultural Debates**:  
   - A subthread debates AI blocking chemical weapon info (e.g., sarin production), with rebuttals that such knowledge is public and censoring academic topics risks normalizing thought control. Discussions branch into cultural practices like FGM, with concerns that AI might reinforce harmful norms if trained on biased data.  

4. **Governance & Power Dynamics**:  
   - Users fear centralized control of AI could lead to market monopolies or state abuse. Proponents of open models argue for user-defined alignment to avoid corporate/governmental overreach.  

5. **Skepticism vs. Optimism**:  
   - While some praise the technical progress, others dismiss it as "security theater," predicting jailbreaks will evolve. Parallels are drawn to encryption debates, where tools eventually bypass restrictions.  

Overall, the conversation reflects tension between safety innovation and risks of authoritarian overcorrection, with no clear consensus on balancing these priorities.

### AI systems with 'unacceptable risk' are now banned in the EU

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/02/ai-systems-with-unacceptable-risk-are-now-banned-in-the-eu/) | 420 points | by [geox](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=geox) | [346 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42916849)

As of February 2, 2025, the European Union has put into effect the first compliance deadline for the AI Act, a sweeping regulatory framework aimed at managing the risks associated with AI systems. This date marks a significant step forward, as regulators in the bloc now have the authority to ban AI systems they find to present an "unacceptable risk."

The AI Act categorizes AI risks into four levels: minimal, limited, high, and unacceptable. While minimal risk applications like email spam filters fall outside regulatory oversight, those deemed to pose an unacceptable risk face outright prohibition. This includes AI-driven activities such as social scoring based on behavior, subliminal manipulation of decisions, exploitation of vulnerabilities, predictive policing based on appearance, real-time biometric surveillance for law enforcement, and unauthorized expansion of facial recognition databases.

Non-compliance could lead to hefty fines that reach up to €35 million or 7% of a company's annual revenue, whichever is greater. However, effective enforcement is anticipated to commence by August when fines and further compliance measures will be more clearly defined.

Notably, over 100 companies, including tech giants like Amazon, Google, and OpenAI, have preemptively committed to adhering to the framework by signing the EU AI Pact. Conversely, notable absentees from this list include Meta, Apple, and French AI startup Mistral, though this doesn't exempt them from future obligations.

A few exceptions exist under the Act, particularly for law enforcement and workplace applications where the use of certain AI systems is justified for safety and medical reasons, provided authorization is obtained.

Industry experts such as Rob Sumroy from Slaughter and May highlight the ongoing need for businesses to navigate overlapping regulations like GDPR, NIS2, and DORA alongside the AI Act. Clarity on these intersections is expected to evolve as additional guidelines are released and enforcement begins in earnest.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on EU AI Act and GDPR Concerns:**

1. **Regulatory Vagueness and Ambiguity**  
   - Participants critiqued the EU AI Act and GDPR for broad, unclear definitions. For example, the AI Act’s broad categorization of "AI systems" could encompass even deterministic, rule-based software (e.g., spam filters or basic algorithms). This risks overregulation of non-AI tools and creates compliance confusion.  
   - GDPR comparisons highlighted its historical ambiguity, with debates over whether IP addresses qualify as personal data (PII) under strict interpretations, complicating practices like logging and cybersecurity. Technical workarounds (e.g., hashing IPs) were discussed but deemed impractical for small businesses.

2. **Disproportionate Impact on Small Businesses**  
   - A prominent theme was the burden of compliance on SMEs. Critics argued GDPR forced small firms to incur significant costs (e.g., €400/year for compliance tools), while large tech companies easily adapted. Some cited studies showing SME profits declining post-GDPR, contrasting with big tech’s resilience.  
   - Skepticism arose over claims that regulations like GDPR “hurt” big tech, with accusations of **regulatory capture**—where large firms influence rules to disadvantage smaller competitors.

3. **Debate Over AI Definition in the EU AI Act**  
   - Critics argued the Act’s broad definitions (e.g., "autonomous" systems) could classify basic software as AI. One user noted that traditional statistical tools or rule-based systems might fall under the Act’s scope, creating unnecessary red tape.  
   - Subthreads dissected legal language (e.g., Recital 12 vs. Article 3), highlighting discrepancies between technical reality and legislative intent.

4. **GDPR’s Mixed Legacy and Effectiveness**  
   - While some praised GDPR for global privacy norms (e.g., Facebook/Google altering data practices), others argued it failed to curb big tech’s data dominance. Critics noted small businesses bore the brunt of compliance costs with minimal tangible benefits for citizens.  
   - Enforcement inconsistencies were criticized, with anecdotes of trivial GDPR violations (e.g., logging IPs) punished more harshly than corporate malpractices.

5. **Technical Compliance Challenges**  
   - Discussions included practical hurdles, such as reconciling GDPR’s IP logging restrictions with cybersecurity needs, or anonymizing data in AI training. Some doubted the feasibility of enforcing the AI Act’s biometric surveillance bans.  

6. **Regulatory Overlap and Industry Responses**  
   - Experts emphasized navigating overlapping regulations (e.g., AI Act, GDPR, NIS2). Many urged clearer guidelines as enforcement begins.  
   - Notable absences (Meta, Apple, Mistral) from the EU AI Pact sparked debates about future enforcement effectiveness, though signatories like Google and OpenAI signal early cooperation.

**Key Sentiments**:  
- **Frustration** with regulatory ambiguity.  
- **Skepticism** toward claims of big tech’s compliance struggles.  
- **Concerns over innovation stifling**, especially for SMEs.  
- **Pragmatic calls** for clearer definitions and proportionality in enforcement.

In an exciting development for the European tech scene, a powerhouse consortium of AI leaders and institutions has launched the OpenEuroLLM project, aiming to propel Europe to the forefront of global AI advancement. Under the coordination of Jan Hajič from Charles University and support from Peter Sarlin at AMD Silo AI, this initiative unites 20 influential research institutions, companies, and EuroHPC centers across Europe. Their mission? To create next-generation, open-source language models that are multilingual and scalable, reinforcing Europe’s digital sovereignty and competitive edge.

Central to this initiative is the commitment to transparency and openness, principles that resonate deeply within Europe’s tech ecosystem. By developing these models within Europe's stringent regulatory frameworks, the consortium ensures alignment with European values, empowering businesses to thrive in global markets while enhancing public service delivery.

The collaboration, backed by the European Commission under the Digital Europe Programme, will see these models benefit from Europe’s vast R&D landscape, from high-quality data repositories to prior pilot models. Additionally, the Open Strategic Partnership Board, in conjunction with open-source communities like LAION and OpenML, will guide the tailoring of these models for industrial and public sector applications, ensuring linguistic and cultural inclusivity across Europe's diverse tapestry.

With a solid foundation in place, the OpenEuroLLM project aims not only to democratize access to cutting-edge AI frameworks but also to set a benchmark for community-driven tech innovation on a global scale. The initiative commences work from February 1, 2025, marking a significant step towards a transparent and sovereign digital future for Europe.

The Hacker News discussion around the OpenEuroLLM project and broader EU tech initiatives reveals skepticism and debate over bureaucratic inefficiencies, funding allocation, and project outcomes. Critics highlight recurring issues:

1. **Bureaucracy and Mismanagement**: Users like `snshn-` and `misiek08` criticize EU grants for favoring lengthy proposals and compliance over tangible results. Mentions of "fake corporate addresses" and LinkedIn profiles in applications suggest fraud risks, while funds often disperse into small, diluted chunks across projects.

2. **Failed or Overhyped Projects**: Commenters cite past EU projects (Graphene Flagship, Clean Sky) as costly with underwhelming commercial returns. `clswth` calls them "disasters," arguing benefits flowed to China/U.S. despite EU investment. Horizon 2020 projects are lampooned as "slide decks" lacking real-world impact.

3. **Space Programs vs. Private Innovation**: Comparisons between ESA (Ariane rockets) and SpaceX dominate. Critics note ESA’s high costs, rocket failures, and lagging innovation (e.g., Ariane 5 explosions) versus SpaceX’s reusable rockets and rapid iteration. Some defend EU’s scientific contributions (e.g., Galileo GNSS) but concede bureaucratic stagnation.

4. **Mixed Defense of EU Collaboration**: Proponents like `rckdckrd` argue EU projects (e.g., Higgs boson discovery at CERN) demonstrate success in foundational research. Others acknowledge inefficiencies but highlight Europe’s collaborative strength in long-term R&D.

**Overall Sentiment**: Skepticism prevails, with concerns about transparency, ROI, and bureaucratic bloat overshadowing optimism. While EU projects are praised for ambition and collaboration, critics argue they struggle with execution, commercialization, and keeping pace with private-sector innovation.

### Efficient Reasoning with Hidden Thinking

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19201) | 160 points | by [fofoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fofoz) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919597)

In a groundbreaking new study, a team of researchers led by Xuan Shen has unveiled an innovative framework, Heima (also known as hidden llama), aimed at significantly enhancing the efficiency of reasoning in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Presented in their arXiv preprint, the team introduces a strategy that compacts verbose Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning processes into more streamlined hidden representations. 

The Heima approach employs a specially designed encoder to condense these thought chains into singular, high-level thinking tokens, minimizing the verbosity traditionally bogging down textual reasoning. Correspondingly, a Heima Decoder works in tandem with Large Language Models (LLMs) to effectively interpret these condensed hidden representations back into textual sequences that are easy to follow yet maintain the integrity of the original reasoning process.

The practical outcomes of this research are promising: Heima not only improves generation efficiency but also sustains, or even surpasses, zero-shot task accuracy across various reasoning benchmarks. Its robust ability to reconstruct multimodal reasoning processes further validates its interpretative power, highlighting its potential to revolutionize how we approach computational language tasks.

Stay tuned to see how this advancement could reshape frameworks for AI-driven problem solving in the future!

### Ruby “Thread Contention” Is Simply GVL Queuing

#### [Submission URL](https://island94.org/2025/01/ruby-thread-contention-simply-gvl-queuing) | 96 points | by [ciconia](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ciconia) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42916203)

In a deep dive into Ruby's Global VM Lock (GVL) and thread contention, a series of insightful posts by Jean Boussier and others have shed light on these concepts, which are crucial for understanding Ruby's concurrency model. The revelation here is quite interesting and perhaps surprising to many, particularly for those familiar with Ruby's reputation for concurrency issues.

For the longest time, many, including experienced Ruby developers, had a misunderstanding of "thread contention." It's often imagined as a chaotic jostling where threads compete fiercely for resources. However, the reality in Ruby is quite orderly: threads take turns accessing the GVL in a queue-like system.

When you start a new thread in Ruby using `Thread.new`, it queues up, patiently waiting its turn to receive the GVL. Once a thread obtains the GVL, it runs its Ruby code until it either performs an I/O operation (releasing the GVL) or surpasses its "thread quantum," a configurable time limit (defaulting to 100ms). The thread then goes to the end of the queue, allowing another thread its shot at the GVL. This cycle repeats in a structured fashion, resembling more a polite, timed dance than a brawl.

This orderly GVL management can, however, lead to what is called "tail latency," especially apparent when short, I/O-bound tasks run alongside more CPU-intensive ones. In such cases, high-priority, CPU-bound operations can hog the GVL, causing significant delays for their I/O-bound counterparts. For instance, a supposedly quick 10ms task stretches to an agonizing 1,000ms when forced to wait its turn.

Addressing this means carefully managing thread priorities and possibly adjusting the thread quantum to allow more frequent sharing of the GVL. Though Ruby 3.3 has introduced M:N threading to alter its concurrency mapping, more granular control remains nuanced under the current system, where the GVL still plays a pivotal role. Understanding the mechanics of GVL contention is vital for optimizing Ruby's performance, especially in multithreaded applications.

So, next time you face performance issues with a Ruby application, consider this: maybe the threads are too polite for their own good, and a little re-prioritization might go a long way.

### First place in Tetris 99 using computer vision, classical AI, a lot of free time

#### [Submission URL](https://bpinzone.github.io/TetrisAI/) | 62 points | by [sschul](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sschul) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42919821)

In a fascinating blend of computer science and gaming prowess, a team of programmers has developed a Tetris-playing AI named "Jeff" that can compete in Tetris 99, a popular battle royale-inspired version of the classic game for the Nintendo Switch. Incorporating computer vision and traditional AI techniques such as a depth-first search algorithm optimized with a custom utility function, Jeff analyzes the Tetris board and determines optimal placements for blocks. This ambitious project didn't just start and end with coding—it evolved from an initial idea to play Tetris autonomously in a terminal, to actually interfacing with the Switch through USB, using a microcontroller.

Jeff's architecture is divided into three distinct parts: his "eyes," which use an HDMI output and capture card to read the game state; his "brain," which calculates the best moves; and his "hands," which send the necessary button presses to the Switch. Initially, the creators aimed for a wireless, webcam-driven approach that turned out to be too unstable due to lighting issues and image quality, pushing them towards a more reliable HDMI setup.

The project stemmed from a casual conversation and organically grew into a sophisticated system placing consistently in the top 15 players, and even occasionally clinching first place—a testament to the effectiveness of Jeff's algorithm. The creators share insightful anecdotes on the challenges and solutions they encountered, like overcoming the unreliable color-based piece recognition by shifting to shape-based identifications using reference images.

Though Jeff is a marvel in gaming AI, his creators acknowledge imperfections, showcased humorously in a video where Jeff's struggle to fit pieces adds a human-like charm to his digital prowess. With this unique venture, the team not only reinvented how a game could be played but also celebrated the blend of technical engineering and playful curiosity.

The Hacker News discussion about the Tetris AI "Jeff" revolves around technical critiques, gameplay strategy debates, and philosophical questions about AI in gaming. Here are the key points:

1. **Algorithm Critique**:  
   - Users debate whether Jeff’s depth-first search (DFS) and hand-tuned utility function qualify as "AI" or are better described as classical algorithms. Some argue the term "AI" is overused, preferring labels like "heuristic-driven algorithm."  
   - Comparisons to reinforcement learning (RL) pitfalls arise, citing examples like Tom7’s Mario AI exploiting glitches. Critics suggest Jeff’s reduced search depth might lead to suboptimal "reward hacking" rather than true strategic mastery.

2. **Gameplay Strategy**:  
   - Skeptics question Jeff’s effectiveness in *Tetris 99*'s multiplayer environment. It prioritizes survival over aggressive tactics (e.g., T-spins, targeted attacks), relying on luck for top placements rather than skill. Critics call this "pathetic" compared to human metas.  
   - Technical nuances like the 7-bag randomizer (modern Tetris’ piece distribution system) are discussed, with users explaining how AI could optimize around these mechanics.

3. **Ethics and Detection**:  
   - Some label Jeff as "cheating," though others note detecting AI in Tetris is hard due to ambiguous input patterns. A subthread compares this to Hearthstone bots intentionally designed to mimic human flaws.  
   - Debate ensues about whether Nintendo should ban AI players, given *Tetris 99*’s battle royale format.

4. **Technical Praise and Nostalgia**:  
   - The project’s engineering—computer vision, Switch hardware integration—is admired. Users reference Colin Fahey’s 2007 Tetris AI and historical randomizer challenges (e.g., Game Boy’s bugged RNG).  
   - Humor emerges about "AI" hype vs. classical algorithms, with quips like: "It’s not AI, just a depth-first search."

5. **Community and Competition**:  
   - Players share personal *Tetris 99* achievements, subtly critiquing the AI’s claimed performance. Others defend Jeff’s minimalistic approach, arguing survival-centric play is valid.  

**Final Take**: The thread blends admiration for technical execution with skepticism about Jeff’s competitive prowess and the broader implications of AI in multiplayer games. While applauding the project’s creativity, many stress that true "good" AI would mimic human-like aggression, not just survive.

### US bill proposes jail time for people who download DeepSeek

#### [Submission URL](https://www.404media.co/senator-hawley-proposes-jail-time-for-people-who-download-deepseek/) | 469 points | by [soundworlds](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=soundworlds) | [280 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42925001)

In an ambitious and controversial move, Senator Josh Hawley has proposed a fraught new bill seeking to criminalize the importation and exportation of AI technologies to and from China. This legislative endeavor, dubbed the Decoupling America’s Artificial Intelligence Capabilities from China Act, arrives on the heels of the release of DeepSeek, a sophisticated AI model from China that has quickly risen in popularity.

Hawley's proposal posits severe penalties—up to 20 years in prison or a one million dollar fine—for those who knowingly download these models. Critics are quick to label the bill both dystopian and overly expansive, warning that its enactment could spell disaster for scientific dialogue, tech innovation, and free speech on the web.

The bill’s sweeping nature extends to American companies as well, banning participation in AI research or investment in China—a move poised to upend collaborations and exchange of knowledge between the countries. Legal analysts point out the bill's requirement of "willful" conduct for criminal charges, yet express concern over possible civil penalties that would be harsher and don't require such proof.

Experts, such as Kevin Bankston from the CDT and Kit Walsh of the EFF, fear that such a restriction could stifle openness in AI advancement, disproportionately benefiting proprietary tech giants. Fox News covered the bill with supportive tones, though skeptics urge a careful examination of its broadly punitive measures that could impact average users and disrupt open AI development. As debate stirs around this legislative proposal, the implications for future U.S.-China tech exchanges and the global AI landscape remain a heated subject.

The Hacker News discussion on Senator Josh Hawley's proposed AI bill and its parallels to the TikTok ban revolves around skepticism of national security justifications, fears of censorship, and political motivations. Key points include:

1. **Overreach & Free Speech Concerns**: Critics argue the bill’s broad language could criminalize academic collaboration and suppress free speech, such as reading Chinese research or discussing topics like Palestine. The EFF and others warn it risks normalizing censorship akin to China’s model.

2. **TikTok Precedent & Hypocrisy**: Comparisons are drawn to the TikTok ban, with users doubting national security claims and highlighting contradictions. Libertarians supporting bans faced criticism for abandoning free speech principles. Some suggest the TikTok ban targets pro-Palestine content, driven by pro-Israel lobbying (e.g., AIPAC) to suppress narratives critical of Israel’s actions in Gaza.

3. **Political Motivations**: Speculation arises that the bills are less about security and more about controlling narratives. Users cite closed-door intelligence meetings and TikTok’s role in amplifying Palestinian perspectives as motivators. The UK TikTok VP’s admission of Chinese government influence over moderation is noted as concrete evidence of risks, though many dismiss U.S. claims as lacking public proof.

4. **Cynicism Toward Secret Evidence**: Many distrust claims relying on classified intelligence, arguing such secrecy undermines democratic oversight. Comparisons are made to the rushed Patriot Act, with calls for transparent, rights-protecting legislation like GDPR instead.

5. **Impact on Competition**: Critics warn the bill could stifle open-source AI development, benefiting proprietary tech giants while harming global innovation.

Overall, the discussion paints the proposed legislation as politically charged and reactionary, prioritizing narrative control and corporate interests over genuine security or free expression.
