### Price fixing by algorithm is still price fixing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2024/03/price-fixing-algorithm-still-price-fixing) | 740 points | by [nabla9](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nabla9) | [486 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39575803)

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice are cracking down on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market. In a joint legal brief, they emphasized that using technology to collude on rental pricing is still illegal under antitrust laws. With rental prices soaring, landlords using algorithms to set prices may hinder competition and harm consumers. The agencies warn that agreeing to use a shared pricing algorithm is considered collusion, and deviations from suggested prices do not justify illegal behavior. This crackdown extends beyond the housing industry, with cases involving online resales and meat processing competitors. The message is clear: whether it's through algorithms or other means, price-fixing will not be tolerated.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about the crackdown on price fixing through algorithms in the residential housing market delves into various aspects of using software tools like YieldStar to set pricing in the rental industry. Users discuss the legality of using algorithms to set public information prices, subscription services for pricing data, implications of not following suggested pricing, and the sharing of rental control data. Some users point out that collusion does not require a formal contract, while others mention court cases involving RealPage and Yardi Systems.

### A story of a large loop with a long instruction dependency chain

#### [Submission URL](https://johnnysswlab.com/a-story-of-a-very-large-loop-with-a-long-instruction-dependency-chain/) | 30 points | by [signa11](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=signa11) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39562194)

Johnny's Software Lab LLC delves into the intricate world of software performance. In a recent case study, they tackled a thorny performance issue involving a lengthy loop. Despite the loop being optimized with vector intrinsics, a high cycles per instruction (CPI) number hinted at underlying inefficiencies. Upon closer inspection, they uncovered a chain of instruction dependencies within the loop, dampening CPU performance.

To experiment with this scenario, a loop with a prolonged dependency chain but no loop-carried dependencies was constructed. By analyzing the impact of nested cosine calculations on CPI, they revealed a diminishing CPI trend as the dependency chain lengthened. Introducing interleaving as a solution to boost instruction level parallelism (ILP) proved effective but complex, raising concerns of register usage and code complexity.

Exploring an alternative approach, they employed loop fission to split the original loop into smaller segments, each handling a cosine calculation. This method, although not as efficient as interleaving, showed improvements in performance compared to the initial loop setup. By breaking down the loop into manageable chunks with temporary storage for intermediate results, the fissioned loop exhibited better performance outcomes.

In the realm of software performance optimization, Johnny's Software Lab LLC delves deep into the intricacies of code structure to enhance efficiency and execution speed.

### Open-Source AI at FOSDEM

#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/Articles/961868/) | 74 points | by [kristianpaul](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kristianpaul) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39567960)

The latest buzz at FOSDEM 2024 was all about open-source AI models, particularly large language models (LLMs) that can generate human-like text. Even though companies developing these models are hesitant to open-source them due to the hefty investment required, there's a growing trend of imposing ethical restrictions on AI models through licensing. Niharika Singhal from the Free Software Foundation Europe highlighted various restrictions like the Hippocratic License and the Llama 2 v2 use policy that limit the use of AI models for certain activities. She emphasized the importance of ensuring that the licenses of AI models are interoperable with free-software licenses to maintain openness in AI.

Stefano Maffulli from the Open Source Initiative discussed efforts to define open-source AI, stating that for an AI system to be categorized as open-source, it should grant users the freedoms to use, study, modify, and share it. The OSI plans to release a new draft of the open-source AI definition monthly, aiming for a 1.0 release by the end of October 2024. Maffulli emphasized that there can't be a middle ground – an AI system is either open source or it isn't. Misuse of the term "open source" was pointed out, such as Meta's Llama 2 model which, despite being labeled as open source, has restrictions on commercial use that conflict with the Open Source Definition.
