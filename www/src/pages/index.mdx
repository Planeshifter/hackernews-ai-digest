### Unsupervised speech-to-speech translation from monolingual data

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/12/unsupervised-speech-to-speech.html) | 20 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497549)

Google Research has introduced Translatotron 3, an unsupervised speech-to-speech translation architecture that can learn the translation task from monolingual data alone. Traditional speech-to-speech translation models rely on parallel speech data, which is scarce, leading to the need for synthesized data. However, Translatotron 3 eliminates the requirement for bilingual speech datasets by incorporating techniques such as back-translation, pre-training with SpecAugment, and unsupervised embedding mapping based on Multilingual Unsupervised Embeddings (MUSE). Experimental results between Spanish and English show that Translatotron 3 outperforms a baseline cascade system. By preserving paralinguistic characteristics, such as tone and emotion, Translatotron 3 aims to improve the quality and authenticity of translated speech.

The discussion revolves around the Translatotron 3 submission on Hacker News. One user, "xnx," comments on the challenges of translating languages and mentions that it often stretches the mind. Another user, "grsv," responds, stating that it is humans' sentience and comprehension that allows them to learn languages, and the proposed method relies on training models with monolingual speech-text datasets. "grsv" further explains that the proposed method utilizes a shared embedding space for languages, forcing the model to learn semantics independently of the language. Additionally, they mention using back-translation for training and conducting performance checks using a Spanish-English-Spanish translation loop. They express enthusiasm for the promising and interesting results, wondering how similar the languages need to be at a lexical level for the model's performance to excel. Another user, "IanCal," shares their curiosity about the level of complexity in English and internal linguistic representation, and suggests that if there is a low complexity in mapping internal representations, then a sensible sentence in English should result in a sensible sentence in the translated language.

Overall, the discussion focuses on the methodology and potential implications of Translatotron 3, with users expressing interest in the results and exploring the nuances of language translation.

### Galactic algorithm

#### [Submission URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_algorithm) | 115 points | by [sockaddr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sockaddr) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500782)

In computer science, there is a concept called a galactic algorithm. These are algorithms that have incredible theoretical performance but are never actually used in practice. There are a few reasons for this. Sometimes the performance gains only apply to problems that are so large they never occur in real-world scenarios. Other times, the complexity of the algorithm outweighs the relatively small gain in performance. These algorithms are named "galactic" because they will never be used on any data sets here on Earth.

Even though galactic algorithms are not used in practice, they can still contribute to computer science in a few ways. Firstly, they may introduce new techniques that can eventually be used to create practical algorithms. Secondly, as computational power advances, previously impractical algorithms may become feasible to use. Thirdly, even if an algorithm is impractical, it can still demonstrate that certain bounds can be achieved or prove that proposed bounds are incorrect, thereby advancing the theory of algorithms.

For example, there are galactic algorithms for problems like integer multiplication, matrix multiplication, communication channel capacity, sub-graph testing, cryptographic breaks, and the traveling salesman problem. These algorithms have impressive theoretical performance, but their large constants make them impractical for real-world use. However, they still serve important purposes. For instance, they can inspire further research and refinement to make them more practical or they can settle important open problems in computer science, like the P versus NP problem.

So, while galactic algorithms may never be used in practice, they still have value in advancing the field of computer science and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to galactic algorithms. One commenter shares a link to a paper that discusses a simulated annealing algorithm for solving global optimization problems. Another commenter expresses doubt about the practicality of these algorithms, suggesting that simulated annealing and random restarts may not be effective. Another user finds the topic interesting and mentions that numbers can be fascinating. 

One commenter asks if the concept of galactic algorithms can be applied to other fields. Another user shares a link to Optimal Universal Search, which is related to the topic of optimal algorithms. 

There is also a discussion about the classification of General Relativity as a galactic algorithm for solving Newtonian Equations. A user argues that General Relativity is not a true galactic algorithm because it provides similar answers when calculating the motion of spacecraft around a black hole. However, another user argues that the comparison is not accurate and that the complexity and practicality of General Relativity differ from galactic algorithms.

The discussion ends with a user mentioning that General Relativity is used in GPS to correct clock discrepancies based on its small correction below a galactic scale.

Today's top story on Hacker News is about a new technique in generative AI called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). RAG is a process that enhances the accuracy and reliability of AI models by fetching facts from external sources, filling a gap in how large language models (LLMs) work. LLMs, like judges in a courtroom, can respond to a wide range of human queries, but they often require an assistant to do research and provide authoritative answers with cited sources. RAG serves as the court clerk of AI, connecting generative AI models to external resources and enabling them to cite sources, clear up ambiguity in user queries, and reduce the possibility of making wrong guesses. The technique also allows users to have conversations with data repositories, opening up new kinds of experiences and making applications for RAG multiple times the number of available datasets. Companies like AWS, IBM, Google, and Microsoft are already adopting RAG. NVIDIA has developed a reference architecture for retrieval-augmented generation to help users get started and has included it in their AI Enterprise software platform. The NVIDIA GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is ideal for RAG workflows, as it provides massive amounts of memory and compute, resulting in a significant speedup. RAG doesn't require a data center and can be run on Windows PCs equipped with NVIDIA RTX GPUs, making it accessible to users even on their laptops. Overall, RAG represents the future of generative AI by improving accuracy, reliability, and user trust.

The discussion on the submission about retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) involves various viewpoints and topics. Some users question the accuracy and adequacy of RAG, suggesting that it may not be effective in generating high-quality answers without fine-tuning on relevant knowledge-rich question-and-answer pairs. Others point out that RAG compensates for the limitations of large language models (LLMs) by allowing them to approximate and retrieve information from external sources. The potential use of RAG in structuring unstructured text and solving problems is also discussed. Suggestions are made to explore coupling vector embeddings with knowledge graphs to provide informed answers. The effectiveness of using vector strings and different search types is highlighted.

There are references to related articles and resources that cover topics such as semantic search and getting started with vector-based retrievals. The controversy surrounding RAG and its potential impact on the AI industry is touched upon, as well as the limitations and challenges of integrating RAG into existing systems. One user mentions their plans to use RAG for document search and references GPT4All, a private project using GPT-2, and the RAG technique.

In a recent article on Techdirt, author Matthew Lane discusses the importance of fair use in copyright law and its implications for AI companies. Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission, primarily for purposes such as commentary, criticism, and parody. Lane highlights how fair use has filled an important gap in social media and art, allowing us to retweet or link content without fear of copyright infringement. Moreover, many creators who make a living from streaming video games or creating "react" content rely on fair use protection. However, Lane expresses concern over public interest advocates who are willing to sacrifice fair use in order to regulate AI companies. He argues that using copyright in this way would be both unnecessary and detrimental, as it would hinder the ability of AI to analyze content and potentially lead to the exploitation of artists. Lane suggests that addressing the issues surrounding AI, such as worker exploitation, requires thoughtful policy-making rather than using copyright as a blunt instrument. He draws parallels to the fights against "on a computer" software patents, which caused problems in the past and still persist today. Lane concludes by emphasizing the need to preserve fair use and prevent its erosion in the face of new technological advancements.

Discussion:

- User "chlmrs" acknowledges that there are concerns about AI companies pushing for shorter copyright terms, but questions the need for AI models to have access to copyrighted material. They argue that AI models should follow rules that are established and applied fairly.
- User "Arainach" expresses skepticism about the existence of IP laws and believes that copyright terms should be longer. They also discuss the limited duration of patents and distinguish between the practical value of art and inventions.
- User "MightyBuzzard" argues that the purpose of copyright laws is to protect expressions of ideas and not to control access to creative content. They emphasize the importance of protecting artists and allowing them to profit from their work.
- User "wffltwr" raises concerns about the impact of AI on copyright laws and suggests that AI interfaces that improve the capabilities of human thought may challenge current copyright laws.
- User "gdy" agrees with the concerns expressed by "MightyBuzzard" and believes that AI should not have the ability to tighten copyright laws. They reference the Blurred Lines lawsuit as an example of how copyright claims can become subjective.
- User "ls612" suggests searching for Supreme Court cases related to Google and small excerpts of books in search results.
- User "dnrs" agrees with the sentiment that IP laws have been flipped to favor larger companies and that AI projects by big companies are potentially infringing on the works of smaller creators.
- User "MightyBuzzard" responds by stating that AI replicating uninspired creations is not a valid argument, as it assumes that AI scientists have replicated the human mind, which they argue is not the case.
- User "wrd" agrees with the concerns raised by "MightyBuzzard" and emphasizes the need to consider the perspective of regular people who are creating and sharing content.
- User "dnrs" argues that regular people creating and sharing content are often not adequately compensated, while the wealthy companies that control the copyright laws benefit greatly.
- User "wrd" points out that allowing AI natural access to licensed works while restricting human artists could create a problematic double standard.
- User "wffltwr" warns against accepting radical changes to copyright laws and suggests that AI and digital laws may cause unintended consequences.

Overall, the discussion revolves around the potential implications of copyright laws on AI companies, artists, and content creators. There are concerns about fair compensation for artists and the balance between protecting copyright and enabling innovation in AI technology.
