### Aurora I/O optimized config saved 90% DB cost

#### [Submission URL](https://graphite.dev/blog/how-an-aws-aurora-feature-cut-db-costs) | 128 points | by [fosterfriends](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fosterfriends) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37079909)

In a recent blog post, Greg Foster, the CTO of a company called Graphite, shared how a new feature of AWS Aurora helped them reduce their database costs by 90%. Graphite's data is stored on Amazon Aurora Postgres, and due to their bidirectional sync with GitHub, their database load is larger than usual for a startup of their size. This was resulting in high costs, with Aurora accounting for over 80% of their AWS bill. 

Initially, they explored using Aurora Serverless to reduce costs by only paying for capacity consumed. However, their constant ingestion of updates from GitHub required a large instance size, which made it more expensive than using a fixed size instance. They were also not in need of automatic upscaling and downscaling capabilities.

Then, in May, AWS released a new feature called "Aurora I/O Optimized" that directly addressed their high I/O costs. It offered up to 40% cost savings by charging a slightly higher storage rate but no I/O charges. After migrating to I/O Optimized, Graphite saw a whopping 90% reduction in costs.

The migration process was straightforward, which involved converting existing clusters with a few clicks in the console, using the CLI, or AWS's SDK. When they reached out to AWS to find out why this feature was built, they discovered that the Aurora team wanted to enable more customers to run heavier I/O workloads without worrying about the costs.

Foster concludes the blog post by encouraging readers to monitor their AWS bills, experiment with cost optimization, and stay updated on new features and updates from their database provider.
