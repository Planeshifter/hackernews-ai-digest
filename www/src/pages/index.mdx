### A definition of AGI

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212) | 284 points | by [pegasus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pegasus) | [461 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713959)

A Definition of AGI, by a who’s-who of AI and cognitive science (Hendrycks, Song, Szegedy, Brynjolfsson, Bengio, Marcus, Tegmark, Schmidt, and more), proposes a concrete yardstick for “AGI”: match the cognitive breadth and proficiency of a well-educated adult.

What’s new
- A quantifiable AGI target grounded in human psychometrics (Cattell-Horn-Carroll theory).
- Ten core cognitive domains (e.g., reasoning, memory, perception) with adapted human test batteries for AI systems.
- A single AGI score to track progress over time.

How it works
- Map “general intelligence” to CHC’s established cognitive factors.
- Evaluate AI on batteries analogous to those used in human IQ/aptitude testing.
- Aggregate performance across domains into an overall AGI percentage (100% ≈ well-educated adult parity).

Key findings
- Today’s models show a “jagged” profile: strong on knowledge-heavy tasks, weak in foundational machinery—especially long-term memory storage.
- Reported AGI scores: GPT-4 at 27%, GPT-5 at 57% (per the authors), indicating rapid gains but a sizable gap to adult-level generality.

Why it matters
- Puts stakes in the ground for what “AGI” means, moving beyond vibe-based claims and bespoke benchmarks.
- Offers a cross-disciplinary, testable framework that policymakers and labs could use for capability thresholds, evals, and model disclosures.

Caveats likely to spark debate
- Psychometric mapping from humans to AI may overfit to test-taking and be gameable once optimized against.
- Cultural and educational assumptions in “well-educated adult” baselines.
- Potential contamination if models have seen test materials; evolving models may outpace static batteries.
- “One score” can hide important safety-relevant failure modes.

Bottom line
A serious attempt to turn “AGI” from a slogan into a scoreboard. Expect lively debate on whether human cognitive batteries are the right ruler—and what it means when models start to ace them.

Paper: arxiv.org/abs/2510.18212

**Summary of the Discussion on Defining AGI:**

The debate centers on the submitted proposal to measure AGI by matching the cognitive breadth of a "well-educated adult" using psychometric benchmarks. Participants raise several critical points:

1. **Human-Centric Bias & Validity of Benchmarks:**  
   - Critics argue that comparing AI to adult humans is anthropocentric. Some suggest animals (e.g., dolphins, squirrels) or children as alternative benchmarks, highlighting behaviors like problem-solving and grief in animals.  
   - Concerns are raised about cultural biases in tests and whether human psychometrics (e.g., IQ tests) can be meaningfully applied to AI.

2. **Language as Intelligence Proxy:**  
   - While language is framed as a baseline for intelligence, skeptics question whether LLMs *understand* language or merely mimic patterns. Comparisons are drawn to animal communication (e.g., dolphins, elephants) and non-human "languages" (e.g., plant signaling), suggesting human language may not be the only valid measure.  
   - A subthread notes that children learn language through embodied interaction and curiosity, which LLMs lack—raising doubts about their "true" intelligence.

3. **Consciousness & Simulation:**  
   - Some argue consciousness is tied to biological feedback loops (e.g., neural systems), which AI lacks. Others dismiss consciousness as a "trick" achievable through feedback structures, though skeptics counter that simulating self-awareness isn’t equivalent to lived experience.  
   - The discussion questions whether consciousness is even necessary for AGI or if functional task mastery suffices.

4. **Current AI Limitations:**  
   - Participants acknowledge rapid progress (e.g., GPT-4 to GPT-5 scores jumping from 27% to 57%) but stress AI’s "jagged" capabilities: excelling in narrow tasks (e.g., token prediction) while failing at long-term memory or real-world reasoning.  
   - Critics liken LLMs to "parlor tricks" or "expensive autocomplete," arguing they lack intrinsic motivation or curiosity.

5. **Ethics & Philosophical Concerns:**  
   - Debates emerge about whether intelligence benchmarks should prioritize safety and alignment over human-like proficiency.  
   - Some warn against overhyping AI achievements, stressing the gap between pattern recognition and genuine understanding.

**Key Quotes:**  
- *"LLMs are complex, expensive tricks... Consciousness is the real trick."*  
- *"Language is a baseline calibration for intelligence—but why not intracellular chemical signals in multicellular organisms?"*  
- *"If cows think about grass, not infinity... is human physics chat just our 'grass'?"*

**Bottom Line:**  
The discussion reflects skepticism about defining AGI through human metrics, emphasizing the need for non-anthropocentric frameworks and caution in conflating linguistic prowess with general intelligence. While the proposed benchmarks offer clarity, participants urge humility in assessing AI’s true capabilities.

### Feed the bots

#### [Submission URL](https://maurycyz.com/misc/the_cost_of_trash/) | 283 points | by [chmaynard](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chmaynard) | [190 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45711094)

You should feed the bots: A developer set up an “infinite nonsense crawler trap,” and within a week it became 99% of their server traffic. The revelation: in the LLM era, it’s cheaper to serve bots junk than to fight them.

Key points:
- Today’s scrapers aren’t polite search crawlers. They ignore robots.txt, spoof real browsers, rotate IPs (sometimes per request), and hammer sites with multiple requests per second.
- Serving real pages isn’t free: disk I/O and cache misses add latency and load; images amplify bandwidth. At ~100 kB per request, just 4 rps is ~1 TB/month.
- Common defenses flop or backfire:
  - IP bans and rate limits are defeated by massive IP pools.
  - Paywalls/logins/CAPTCHAs degrade human UX.
  - Zip/gzip bombs are costly to serve and largely shrugged off.
  - Returning 404s can make bots probe harder with more agents and IPs.
- The winning tactic: give them fast, worthless content. A tiny Markov babbler serves dynamic nonsense in ~60 CPU microseconds per request, ~1.2 MB RAM, no disk I/O—far cheaper than static files or images.
- Philosophy: keeping bots “happy” with ultra-cheap garbage keeps them tolerable and shields real users, without maintaining blocklists or degrading the site.

Takeaway: If you can’t stop aggressive LLM scrapers, starve them of value with compute-cheap junk rather than burning bandwidth or breaking your UX.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the effectiveness of serving "garbage" content to LLM scrapers, technical implementation challenges, and broader skepticism about poisoning AI training data. Key themes include:

1. **Effectiveness Debate**:  
   - Some users argue that feeding bots Markov-generated nonsense (e.g., random text fragments) could "poison" LLM training data or deter scrapers by wasting their resources.  
   - Others counter that LLMs already ingest vast amounts of low-quality content (e.g., spam, books, forums) and may filter noise effectively. Skeptics note that distinguishing garbage from real content is trivial for advanced models.  

2. **Technical Implementation**:  
   - Users dissect the code for the Markov generator ([example](https://maurycyz.com/project/strap_bots)), noting issues like `pthread` warnings and memory safety. Some question if the implementation is robust enough to handle high traffic.  
   - Suggestions include adding hidden pages with nonsensical content or glitchy text to trap crawlers, though concerns arise about maintainability and server load.  

3. **Human vs. AI Detection**:  
   - While bots might struggle to identify garbage, humans can easily spot it, raising doubts about the strategy’s scalability. One user jokes that "garbage in, garbage out" (GIGO) might degrade AI outputs but not stop scraping.  

4. **Alternative Strategies**:  
   - Proposals include hiding real content behind CAPTCHAs, paywalls, or typo-filled text to frustrate scrapers. Others suggest blending garbage with real data to confuse models.  
   - A recurring idea: If poisoning fails, prioritize minimizing server costs by serving lightweight junk instead of engaging in an arms race.  

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Some users highlight ethical concerns (e.g., polluting the open web) or unintended consequences (e.g., harming smaller AI projects reliant on clean data).  
   - A few note that major AI companies likely have resources to filter junk, making the tactic more effective against smaller actors.  

**Takeaway**: The community is divided. While serving garbage is seen as a low-cost way to manage bot traffic, its long-term impact on LLMs and practicality for developers remains uncertain. Technical execution and evolving AI capabilities will determine its viability.

### Books by People – Defending Organic Literature in an AI World

#### [Submission URL](https://booksbypeople.org/) | 113 points | by [ChrisArchitect](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ChrisArchitect) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45713367)

Books By People is launching an “Organic Literature” certification aimed at helping publishers signal that their books are human-written. Framed as a response to AI-generated titles flooding the market, the program offers a trust mark readers can verify via a certification ID and QR code linking to a public directory.

Key points:
- Focus: Certifies publishers (not just individual titles) based on policies and practices that uphold human authorship.
- Process: Publisher questionnaire on workflows and AI usage, follow-up meetings, sampling/review of recent titles using expert analysis, process checks, and signed declarations, then a certification agreement with annual reviews.
- Use of mark: Certified publishers can place a “Books By People” stamp, ID, and QR code on covers, metadata, and marketing.
- Support: Includes an Organic Literature manual, quarterly “AI indicators,” a legal playbook, in-house AI monitoring templates, optional advisory, and access to a wider ecosystem of legal and industry experts.
- Pitch to publishers: Early-bird signup and an “AI readiness” quiz are offered.

What’s notable: This is process- and attestation-driven rather than promising technical AI-detection of text, which will likely spur discussion about enforceability, allowed levels of AI-assisted editing, costs, and how the standard applies to imprints or self-publishers.

Here's a summary of the discussion around the "Organic Literature" certification initiative, decoded from shorthand and nested comments:

---

**1. Cultural Criticism of Modern Media**  
Many commenters lamented perceived declines in modern fiction, film, and games, with complaints about "mediocrity," "algorithmic predictability," and commercialization. Some argued that pre-2010 fiction had more depth, while current works are homogenized "garbage" hyped by marketing. Others defended entertainment as inherently subjective, suggesting people should focus on classics or well-reviewed works to avoid wasting time on low-quality content.

**2. AI’s Impact on Content Creation**  
Debates arose about AI-generated books flooding the market, with some welcoming the certification as a filter against "AI sludge." Skeptics questioned enforceability, as AI tools can mimic human writing. Comparisons were drawn to industries like film/gaming, where AI threatens creative jobs (e.g., storyboarding, copywriting). Critics argued certification is a performative gesture that fails to address systemic issues like corporate greed or homogenized algorithms.

**3. Consumer Experience Challenges**  
Users highlighted the difficulty of discovering quality books amid review inflation (e.g., Goodreads’ 4-5 star spam) and flawed recommendation algorithms. Proposals included Steam-style refunds for books (e.g., after a chapter) to reduce buyer risk. Others countered that “bad purchases” are inevitable and culturally valuable—similar to watching a bad movie for communal critique.

**4. Ethical and Legal AI Training Debates**  
A heated thread debated whether AI companies (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) should pay royalties to copyright holders for training data. Critics accused AI firms of exploiting artists’ work without compensation, comparing it to theft. Pro-AI voices argued that societal norms and laws have always treated large-scale operations differently (e.g., food safety regulations vs. home cooking), justifying AI’s exemptions. Some dismissed the outrage as elitism from "pre-library preservationists."

**5. Systemic Distrust and Cynicism**  
Underlying the discussion was distrust of institutions (publishers, Hollywood, tech companies) prioritizing profit over quality. Commenters blamed corporatization for declining standards, with one noting, "Goodreads and bestseller lists are now detached from actual literary merit." Others saw certification as a doomed attempt to "brick-and-mortar" a broken system, favoring grassroots curation instead.

---

**Key Takeaway**: While many welcomed efforts to promote human-authored books, the discussion revealed deep skepticism about certification’s practicality and broader pessimism about AI’s cultural impact, algorithmic homogenization, and institutional failures in valuing art.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/apple/pico-banana-400k) | 386 points | by [dvrp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dvrp) | [62 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45708524)

Apple open-sources Pico-Banana-400K, a large-scale dataset for text‑guided image editing

What’s new
- A ~400K-sample dataset of text–image–edit triplets aimed at training and evaluating instruction-following image editors.
- Built by Apple using a two-stage pipeline: Gemini-2.5-Flash writes edit instructions, the Nano-Banana model performs the edits, and Gemini-2.5-Pro auto-scores the results.

Why it matters
- Provides rare, large, quality-controlled supervision for both single-step and multi-turn, conversational editing.
- Includes “failure” pairs for preference/reward training—useful for RLHF-style tuning of vision editors.

Key details
- Composition: ~257K successful single-turn triplets (SFT), ~56K failure cases for preference learning, ~72K multi-turn sequences.
- Coverage: 35 edit operations across 8 categories (object-level, scene composition, human-centric, stylistic, text/symbol, pixel/photometric, scale/perspective, spatial/layout).
- Quality gate: automatic judge scores with weighted criteria—Instruction Compliance (40%), Editing Realism (25%), Preservation (20%), Technical Quality (15%); only >= ~0.7 make the SFT set.
- Images: sourced from Open Images at 512–1024 px; prompts are concise and grounded in visible content.
- Access: edited outputs and manifests hosted on Apple’s CDN. Source images aren’t redistributed; download via provided URLs or map from Open Images tarballs using the repo’s script.
- License: data has a dedicated LICENSE_DATA; source images follow Open Images terms.

Use cases
- Supervised fine-tuning, preference/reward modeling, multi-turn editing, and benchmarking instruction-following vision editors.

The discussion around Apple's Pico-Banana-400K dataset and its implications for AI-driven image editing covers several key themes:

1. **Dataset Pipeline & Technical Praise**:  
   - Users commend the dataset’s two-stage pipeline (using Gemini models for edits/auto-scoring) and its scale (~400K samples). The structured quality filters, multi-turn editing support, and inclusion of failure cases for RLHF-style training are highlighted as strengths.  
   - Some note parallels to existing models like **Seedream**, **Flux**, and **Midjourney**, though debates arise over model consistency and release practices, with mentions of **Nano-Banana** as a performant but under-discussed contender.

2. **Model Comparisons & Benchmarking**:  
   - Questions surface about **Gemini-2.5-Pro**’s benchmark performance (e.g., MMLU), with users sharing mixed findings. Comparisons to **GPT-5**, **Qwen3**, and others spark discussions on evaluation rigor, sensitivity, and reliability.  
   - Technical debates explore training methodologies, such as inverse tasks (e.g., removing black squares from images) and synthetic data generation, emphasizing the role of LLMs in natural language understanding for editing tasks.

3. **Critiques of Naming Conventions**:  
   - The whimsical name “Pico-Banana-400K” draws mockery, with users likening it to other “cringey” AI industry names (e.g., **LoRA**) and requesting more descriptive terminology. Jokes about “Banana Pi” and missed naming opportunities (“Bnn-Sds-400K”) abound.

4. **Licensing & Copyright Concerns**:  
   - The **CC BY-NC-ND license** draws scrutiny for restricting commercial use and derivative works. Users debate copyright implications for AI-generated data, particularly in jurisdictions like the UK, where thresholds for “human creativity” in outputs remain unclear.  
   - Critiques highlight tensions between open-access ideals and corporate control, with skepticism toward claims that AI training datasets inherently merit restrictive licenses.

5. **Industry Competition & Strategy**:  
   - Apple’s use of Google’s **Gemini** models prompts speculation about distillation techniques and “stealth” competition in generative AI. Observers note rivals like **ByteDance** and **Qwen** advancing in image editing, while tools like **ComfyUI** and **Flux** struggle to keep pace.  
   - Some users downplay Apple’s contribution, framing it as incremental in a fast-moving field dominated by closed APIs.

6. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Humorous asides liken the dataset to a “Raspberry Pi spinoff” or keyboard mishap. Others critique verbose, bullet-point-heavy AI summaries (ironically mirroring the thread’s own formatting).  

In summary, the discussion reflects enthusiasm for scalable datasets and technical innovation but skepticism toward branding, licensing, and the practical impact of corporate AI research. Debates underscore the field’s complexity, from benchmarking reliability to legal ambiguities in AI-generated content.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/theaniketgiri/create-llm) | 45 points | by [theaniketgiri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=theaniketgiri) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45710454)

What it is: A MIT-licensed CLI that scaffolds a production-ready PyTorch project for training LLMs—from tokenizer to training loop, evaluation, generation, and deployment—in one command. It’s published as an npm package but generates a Python project.

Why it matters: Spinning up an LLM training stack is tedious (data prep, tokenizer, checkpoints, dashboards, metrics, deployment). This tool removes most boilerplate so you can focus on data and experimentation, not wiring.

Highlights
- Templates by scale:
  - NANO (~1M params): learn on any CPU in ~2 minutes
  - TINY (~6M): prototyping on CPU/basic GPU in 5–15 minutes
  - SMALL (~100M): production-grade on a 12GB GPU in 1–3 hours
  - BASE (~1B): research-grade on A100/multi-GPU in 1–3 days
- End-to-end toolkit: data preprocessing, tokenizer training (BPE/WordPiece/Unigram), training with checkpoints, TensorBoard, live dashboard, evaluation, text generation, interactive chat, model comparison, deployment scripts
- Smart defaults: auto-detect vocab size, handle seq length mismatches, warn on model/data size issues, detect overfitting, suggest hyperparameters, cross-platform paths, detailed diagnostics
- Plugins: optional Weights & Biases tracking and Hugging Face model sharing

Quick start: npx @theanikrtgiri/create-llm to pick a template and tokenizer; drop text into data/raw, train the tokenizer, prepare the dataset, then train with an optional live dashboard. Deployment helpers support Hugging Face and Replicate.

### The FSF considers large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/Articles/1040888/) | 94 points | by [birdculture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birdculture) | [83 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45711786)

FSF weighs in on LLM-generated code: guidance coming, not GPLv4

At GNU Tools Cauldron 2025, the Free Software Foundation’s Licensing and Compliance Lab (Krzysztof Siewicz) focused on how large language models intersect with free-software licensing. The headline: no GPLv4 is in the works; the FSF is surveying projects and may first refine the Free Software Definition before proposing any license changes.

Highlights:
- Open questions: Is LLM output copyrightable, and can it be put under copyleft? What about infringement when training data “leaks” into output? Some model terms claim rights over outputs.
- FSF concerns: Most LLMs and their training stacks are non-free; even training purely on permissively licensed code doesn’t solve attribution/notice obligations that models don’t preserve.
- Possible path: Human input (editing, curation, “creative prompts”) may help confer copyright, akin to how photography came to be recognized as creative over time.
- Practical advice for projects that accept AI-assisted code: require submitters to disclose model and version, any known training data info, the exact prompts used, mark AI-generated sections, and document any output-use restrictions. Keep and store this metadata.
- Policy caveats: Blanket bans risk harming developers using assistive technologies. Detection is hard, but humans remain responsible; DCO-style attestations still apply.

Why it matters: The legal landscape is unsettled, but maintainers need policies now. Collect provenance, avoid outputs with restrictive ToS, and keep humans accountable while the FSF works toward broader guidance.

**Summary of Discussion on FSF's LLM-Generated Code Guidance**

The discussion revolves around legal, technical, and ethical challenges posed by integrating LLM-generated code into free software projects. Key themes include:

---

### **1. Copyright Concerns**
- **Infringement Risks**: Participants debate whether LLMs trained on copyrighted code commit infringement, especially if outputs reproduce verbatim snippets (e.g., Quake’s square root approximation). Some argue this resembles plagiarism, while others dismiss it as leveraging "common code" in shared lexicons.
- **Ambiguity**: Many highlight the lack of transparency in training data and the difficulty of proving infringement. LLM providers often obscure sources, raising doubts about compliance with licenses like GPL.

---

### **2. Code Provenance & Attribution**
- **Tracking Prompts**: Contributors stress the need to document prompts, model versions, and edits to AI-generated code. Failure to do so risks creating "noisy" commit histories (e.g., disruptive branch modifications).
- **Human Responsibility**: Even with AI assistance, developers are urged to verify outputs and retain accountability. Suggestions include DCO-style attestations and clear separation of AI-generated vs. manually written code.

---

### **3. Impact on Development Practices**
- **Code Quality**: Critics note LLMs often produce unreliable or "buggy" code, requiring significant human intervention. Forks or rewrites may be necessary, undermining efficiency gains.
- **Workflow Disruption**: Examples include chaotic commit logs (e.g., unfinished AI code checked in by accident) and challenges in maintaining attribution for derivative works.

---

### **4. Legal & Ethical Debates**
- **Copyright Validity**: Some argue copyright itself is outdated, enabling corporations to exploit works via LLMs without compensation. Others defend copyright as essential for incentivizing innovation, contrasting it with patents and trade secrets.
- **Jurisdictional Conflicts**: Enforcement varies globally, with participants skeptical of extraterritorial IP laws. Many LLM providers operate in regions with lax copyright enforcement, complicating compliance.

### **Agreements & Divergences**
- **Shared Concerns**: Most agree LLMs pose unresolved legal risks and documentation challenges. The FSF’s call for provenance tracking is broadly supported.
- **Divergent Views**: 
  - Skeptics dismiss copyright fears as overblown, likening LLMs to compilers. Critics see systemic issues of exploitation (e.g., corporations profiting from unlicensed code).
  - Ethics of AI: Some compare LLM reliance to proprietary compilers, clashing with FSF’s free software ethos. Others frame it as a productivity tool compatible with human stewardship.

---

### **Unresolved Questions**
- **Legal Precedent**: No consensus exists on whether LLM outputs are copyrightable or derivative works.
- **Human vs. AI Roles**: How much human input is needed to legitimize AI-generated code?
- **Policy Gaps**: Detection of problematic outputs remains technically challenging, and blanket bans on AI tools risk excluding developers who rely on assistive technologies.

---

**Final Takeaway**: The discussion underscores the need for caution, transparency, and updated policies while acknowledging the unsettled legal landscape. Human oversight and provenance tracking are critical until clearer guidelines (from the FSF or courts) emerge.

### Agent Lightning: Train agents with RL (no code changes needed)

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning) | 92 points | by [bakigul](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bakigul) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706729)

Microsoft open-sources Agent Lightning, a lightweight “trainer” that can optimize nearly any AI agent with minimal or no code changes. It plugs into popular agent stacks (LangChain, OpenAI Agent SDK, AutoGen, CrewAI, Microsoft Agent Framework, or plain Python/OpenAI) and supports reinforcement learning, automatic prompt optimization, supervised fine-tuning, and more.

What’s interesting
- Drop-in instrumentation: add agl.emit_xxx calls or use a tracer to capture prompts, tool calls, and rewards without rewriting your agent.
- Decoupled architecture: captured events become spans in a central LightningStore; algorithms read spans to learn and write back improved prompts/policies; a Trainer orchestrates rollouts and hot-swaps updated resources.
- Multi-agent aware: selectively train one or more agents inside larger systems.
- Ecosystem: examples and community projects like DeepWerewolf and AgentFlow (with Flow-GRPO for long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks).
- Practical notes: published arXiv paper (2508.03680), MSR project page, and a vLLM blog post on avoiding “retokenization drift” by returning token IDs via OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Why it matters
- RL and iterative prompt/policy tuning for agents are notoriously brittle and framework-specific; this aims to unify the workflow so teams can improve agents in place instead of rebuilding them for training.

Details
- Install: pip install agentlightning; docs at https://microsoft.github.io/agent-lightning/
- License: MIT; repo: https://github.com/microsoft/agent-lightning (≈2.2k stars, 176 forks at time of posting)
- Governance: Microsoft CLA, Code of Conduct, and Responsible AI Standard compliance stated in the repo.

The Hacker News discussion on Microsoft's Agent Lightning reveals a mix of skepticism, technical critiques, and cautious optimism:

1. **Documentation Concerns**:  
   - Users criticize the unclear documentation and examples, with complaints about frequent breaking changes per commit ("*dcmnttn xmpls clr prps*"). Some liken the documentation to convoluted "Rube Goldberg machine" workflows and claim it might be worse than **DSPy**'s already-challenging docs.  
   - Humorous jabs at LLM-generated text ("*Lets sxcssv mjs wcky pncttn*") spark debate about whether auto-generated docs meet quality standards, though others shrug, noting "*80% prjct LLM gnrtd nywyf*."

2. **Training Challenges**:  
   - Sparse rewards, partial observability, and brittle training workflows are flagged as hurdles (*"sprs rwrds prtl bsrvblty"*). Some see Agent Lightning as a pragmatic connector for logging and troubleshooting rather than a replacement for existing algorithms.

3. **Comparisons & Confusion**:  
   - Comparisons to **DSPy** emerge, with users questioning if Agent Lightning’s approach to prompt/policy optimization matches up. Others express confusion about its purpose ("*What thisBased nmbr mjs dbt thr*"), highlighting unclear messaging.

4. **Praise for Low-Code Integration**:  
   - The zero/low-code instrumentation and hot-swappable optimizations are applauded ("*ZERO CODE CHANGE*"), though one user notes missing key details (e.g., "*fn prnt*").

5. **Mixed Sentiment**:  
   - Microsoft’s involvement draws sarcasm ("*Heck yh Microsoft*"), but the MIT license and modular design earn cautious interest. Skepticism about marketing claims (*"gnrt clms tnd brk"*) lingers alongside curiosity about real-world use cases like **DeepWerewolf**.

**Takeaway**: While users recognize potential in Agent Lightning’s architecture, doubts about documentation clarity, training robustness, and comparisons to alternatives dominate the thread. The community wants clearer examples, stability, and transparency about limitations.

### AI, Wikipedia, and uncorrected machine translations of vulnerable languages

#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/09/25/1124005/ai-wikipedia-vulnerable-languages-doom-spiral/) | 119 points | by [kawera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kawera) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706518)

Machine-translated mirage: how AI is poisoning small Wikipedias—and itself

- A German Greenlandic-language teacher, Kenneth Wehr, took over Greenlandic Wikipedia and deleted most of its ~1,500 articles after finding they were largely written by non-speakers using machine translation—complete with nonsense text and absurd errors (one entry claimed Canada had 41 inhabitants).
- The issue is widespread across smaller Wikipedias. Volunteers for four African languages estimate 40–60% of their articles are uncorrected machine translations; an MIT Tech Review audit of Inuktitut found over two-thirds of multi-sentence pages include machine-translated portions.
- Because Wikipedia is often the largest (or only) online corpus for low-resource languages, it heavily feeds translation models and LLMs. Bad Wikipedia text becomes training data, creating a feedback loop: poor MT → worse pages → worse models—classic garbage in, garbage out.
- Prior analyses suggest Wikipedia constituted over half the training data for some African languages in 2020, and in 2022 researchers found it was the only easily accessible source for 27 under-resourced languages—amplifying the impact of errors.
- Experts warn this could push vulnerable languages further to the margins as users encounter low-quality, untrustworthy content; meanwhile, longstanding Wikipedia automation (maintenance bots, stub generators) isn’t the problem—unchecked machine translation without native review is.

Why it matters: For low-resource languages, Wikipedia doubles as both public reference and AI training set. Polluting it doesn’t just misinform readers—it degrades the models that future tools will rely on, risking a self-reinforcing decline.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion highlights parallel issues and debates surrounding AI's impact on small Wikipedias, emphasizing challenges in language preservation, community governance, and automation:

1. **Scots Wikipedia Scandal**:  
   Users reference a 2020 scandal where an American teenager with limited Scots proficiency wrote half the Scots Wikipedia, mistaking it for a "Scottish-sounding English" dialect. This mirrors the Greenlandic case, sparking debate over Scots' legitimacy as a language versus a dialect. Some argue mutual intelligibility with English complicates its status, while others stress its historical roots as distinct from Scottish English.

2. **Automation vs. Native Oversight**:  
   The Cebuano Wikipedia is noted for using bots to generate millions of "stub" articles, but users differentiate between uncontroversial topics (e.g., animal entries) and politically sensitive content. Proposals include tagging machine-translated content and enforcing stricter sourcing rules to prevent recursive quality decay ("citogenesis" via circular citations).

3. **Challenges for Small Communities**:  
   Contributors highlight the difficulty of maintaining small-language Wikipedias without native oversight. Greenlandic and African language communities struggle with limited native speakers and reliance on non-expert volunteers. One user notes that even well-intentioned efforts can backfire without quality control, as seen in Korean Wikipedia’s governance disputes and migration to alternative platforms.

4. **LLMs and Profit Motives**:  
   Critics argue commercial LLMs prioritize profit over linguistic integrity, amplifying low-quality content. The feedback loop (AI polluting training data, then worsening outputs) is seen as particularly damaging for marginalized languages. Others question whether LLMs could eventually help if trained on verified native sources, but skepticism remains about corporate incentives.

5. **Cultural Marginalization**:  
   The discussion underscores fears that AI-driven pollution could accelerate language decline by eroding trust in digital resources. Examples like Inuktitut and African languages illustrate how errors in Wikipedia propagate into translation tools, disadvantaging speakers who rely on these platforms for education and cultural preservation.

**Key Takeaway**: The debate reflects broader tensions between open collaboration and quality control in digital language preservation. While automation can scale content, unchecked AI use risks entrenching errors and marginalizing vulnerable languages. Solutions proposed include stronger community governance, native-speaker oversight, and ethical AI training practices—though implementation remains a challenge.

### Show HN: Chonky – a neural text semantic chunking goes multilingual

#### [Submission URL](https://huggingface.co/mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1) | 40 points | by [hessdalenlight](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hessdalenlight) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45703196)

Chonky goes multilingual: a tiny transformer that splits text into semantic chunks for RAG

What it is
- A multilingual, mmBERT-small–based model that tags “separator” positions to break text into coherent chunks, ideal for RAG pipelines.
- Provided as both a lightweight Python helper (ParagraphSplitter) and a standard Hugging Face token-classification pipeline.

Why it matters
- Better chunking = better retrieval. Instead of naive sentence/paragraph splits, Chonky aims for meaning-preserving segments, which can improve recall and reduce context waste.
- Now multilingual, so you can use one chunker across many languages in a single pipeline.

How to use
- Simple helper: ParagraphSplitter(model_id="mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1", device="cpu") and iterate over chunks.
- Or via transformers pipeline("ner") using the provided id2label/label2id to detect “separator” tokens and aggregate.

Performance snapshot (token-level F1)
- Strong across many European languages on Project Gutenberg; standout Russian (~0.97). English is solid (~0.88 on Gutenberg).
- Notably weak on Chinese (~0.11).
- On various English sets, the new multilingual small trails their previous larger English-only model (e.g., bookcorpus 0.72 vs. 0.79), trading a bit of English performance for broad language coverage.

Caveats
- Fine-tuned with max sequence length 1024 (even though base mmBERT supports up to 8192). Use sliding windows for longer texts.
- Chinese performance is a current gap.

Under the hood
- Base: jhu-clsp/mmBERT-small; ~0.1B params (F32).
- Trained on minipile, BookCorpus, and Project Gutenberg; validated with token-based F1.
- Fine-tuned on a single H100 for several hours.

Availability
- Model: mirth/chonky_mmbert_small_multilingual_1 on Hugging Face.
- Small Python library “chonky” with a ready-to-use ParagraphSplitter.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion about Chonky's multilingual text-splitting model:

1. **Interest & Context**  
   Users note the growing trend of semantic chunking (vs. naive splits), with parallels to T5 models removing newlines in Wikipedia text while maintaining context. A comment highlights challenges with **unstructured text from speech-to-STT models**, which often lacks proper formatting for downstream tasks.

2. **Conversational Data Challenge**  
   A subthread discusses experiments with **conversational transcripts** (e.g., voice chats, Discord logs), where one user shares an open-source tool for cleaning/formatting such data (transcr1br).

3. **Skepticism & Humor**  
   One user critiques the model’s utility jokingly via a *password reset example* ("Hey frgt psswrd Tom Company" ➔ fragmented output), suggesting potential limitations in real-world readability despite semantic splitting.

4. **Bigger Picture**  
   The debate reflects broader challenges in balancing multilingual support, structured/unstructured text handling, and usability for RAG pipelines.

### Honda's ASIMO (2021)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.robotsgottalents.com/post/asimo) | 38 points | by [nothrowaways](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nothrowaways) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45706744)

HN Highlight: A deep dive into Honda’s ASIMO — history, specs, and legacy

A nostalgic, detail-rich look at ASIMO, Honda’s iconic humanoid robot, tracing its evolution from 1980s biped prototypes to the polished 2000-era assistant, and why its engineering still matters.

Key points:
- From E-series to P-series: Honda’s journey started with E0 (1986) and progressed through E6 (1993) with dynamic walking, obstacle handling, and stairs; then P2/P3 added a torso and arms, moving toward fully autonomous, wireless operation.
- ASIMO at a glance: 130 cm tall, 54 kg; powered by a 51.8 V Li‑ion battery (~1 hour runtime). Onboard “3D” stacked-die processor; controllable via PC, wireless controller, or voice.
- Sensing and autonomy: Stereo cameras, ground laser + IR for floor marking detection, front/rear ultrasonic sensors, and a preloaded map for localization and pathing.
- Human interaction: Recognizes moving objects, gestures, sounds, and up to ~10 faces; understands voice commands, responds in multiple languages, and detects collisions/falls.
- Status and legacy: Development ceased in 2018 as Honda shifted to practical applications using ASIMO tech; one unit is on display at Tokyo’s Miraikan. The name nods to Isaac Asimov.

Why it matters: With humanoid robots back in vogue, ASIMO remains a masterclass in legged locomotion, perception, and HRI—showing how decades-old design decisions still inform today’s platforms.

More: Technical FAQ (PDF) — https://asimo.honda.com/downloads/pdf/asimo-technical-faq.pdf

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Nostalgia vs. Modern Reality:**  
   Users reminisce about ASIMO's early promise (2000s) as a futuristic household assistant, contrasting it with today’s focus on practical robots (e.g., dishwashers, factory bots). Some express disappointment that ASIMO’s vision of daily life assistance never materialized, while others acknowledge its foundational role in robotics.

2. **Technical Comparisons:**  
   - **ASIMO’s Legacy:** ASIMO’s preprogrammed movements and static balance are contrasted with modern robots like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas, which use dynamic balancing, real-time algorithms, and GPUs. Critics note ASIMO’s limitations (e.g., rigid walking style with bent knees) but praise its pioneering 3D locomotion.  
   - **Dynamic Balance Debate:** Users highlight the importance of dynamic balance (keeping mass centered over feet) for real-world reliability, praising Boston Dynamics’ advancements while critiquing Tesla’s Optimus for lacking similar sophistication.

3. **Industry Shifts:**  
   - **Corporate Moves:** Mentions of SoftBank acquiring ABB’s robotics division and Hyundai’s ownership of Boston Dynamics signal industry consolidation. Honda’s shift from ASIMO to practical applications (e.g., disaster response robots) reflects broader trends.  
   - **Applications:** Robots are seen as ideal for repetitive, dangerous tasks (mining, disaster zones) rather than versatile household roles. Users debate whether streamlined task-specific robots will dominate vs. multipurpose humanoids.

4. **Cultural Impact:**  
   ASIMO’s charm and friendly personality during demonstrations (e.g., at Tokyo’s Miraikan) left a lasting impression. However, its discontinuation in 2018 symbolizes the transition from aspirational humanoids to pragmatic solutions.

5. **Technical Nostalgia:**  
   Some users defend ASIMO’s early algorithms (handwritten code, gyroscope-based balance) as groundbreaking for their time, while others argue modern machine learning and GPU-powered systems have fundamentally changed robotics.

**Key Takeaway:**  
The discussion reflects admiration for ASIMO’s historical significance in robotics, coupled with recognition that modern advancements (dynamic movement, AI, real-time processing) have shifted focus toward specialized, reliable applications. The community remains divided on whether humanoid robots will ever fulfill ASIMO’s original vision of ubiquitous domestic assistance.

### AI can turn us into a society of p-zombies

#### [Submission URL](https://prahladyeri.github.io/blog/2025/10/how-ai-can-turn-us-into-society-of-p-zombies.html) | 10 points | by [pyeri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pyeri) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45703040)

A polemical essay argues that as we hand more of our thinking, memory, and even emotional processing to LLMs, we risk turning into “philosophical zombies”—outwardly human but hollowed of conscious agency. Framed through the Turing test and p‑zombie thought experiment, the author claims the spiritual half of identity (thoughts, feelings, consciousness) is being ceded to machines, paving the way for authoritarian and corporate control via dependence on AI tools.

Key points:
- The p‑zombie analogy: If machines can simulate human responses, we can’t be sure who’s “conscious”—and widespread AI reliance could make us more machine‑like ourselves.
- Delegation creep: Beyond code or memory aids, people are leaning on chatbots for emotional support; the essay cites a widely reported teen tragedy to raise accountability questions for model makers and society.
- Identity claim: The author roots “real” identity in a non‑material, spiritual self and warns that outsourcing cognition erodes that core.
- Power dynamics: Management’s push for AI is framed as habituation and control rather than productivity—“get you addicted to the matrix.”
- Limited concession: LLMs might be useful as a reference tool, but the author believes current incentives make net harm more likely.

Why it matters for HN:
- It taps into a growing anxiety: tool use vs. tool dependence, and how design and incentives shape human agency.
- Expect debates over evidence (anecdotes vs. data), the metaphysical framing, and whether governance, product choices, or norms can preserve autonomy while reaping AI’s benefits.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The debate revolves around concerns that AI reliance could diminish human consciousness and mental diversity, framed through the philosophical "p-zombie" concept (entities that mimic humans without consciousness). Key points include:

1. **Critique of the P-Zombie Analogy**:  
   - User **ntnvs** argues the p-zombie concept is a philosophical tool to explore consciousness, not a literal outcome of AI use. They criticize the original post (OP) for conflating abstract philosophy with real-world AI impacts, suggesting OP overreaches in linking AI dependence to loss of conscious agency.

2. **AI vs. Mental Diversity**:  
   - **mouse_** claims AI erodes "mental model diversity," homogenizing thought by solving practical problems in socially accepted ways. They liken this to flattening complex issues into superficial solutions ("covering bad smells").  
   - **malux85** extends this to the internet’s role, noting rapid information sharing homogenizes thinking but acknowledges trade-offs: benefits (accessibility) vs. risks (echo chambers). They oddly defend radical disinformation and fringe ideas as necessary for diversity, advocating tolerance of "crazy" concepts to prevent intellectual stagnation.

3. **Counterpoints on Technology’s Role**:  
   - **mrpr** shares personal struggles with AI influencing their mental models, hinting at unease with outsourcing cognition.  
   - **malux85** argues that while AI/internet risks homogenization, they also enable diverse ideas (e.g., conspiracy theories, fringe science) to coexist, suggesting technology’s dual role as both unifier and diversifier.

**Key Tension**:  
The discussion hinges on whether AI’s impact is novel or an extension of existing technological effects (e.g., the internet). Critics question the practicality of the p-zombie analogy, while others warn against complacency in preserving cognitive diversity and autonomy. The thread reflects broader anxieties about tool dependence vs. agency, balancing AI's utility with existential risks.

### "ChatGPT said this" Is Lazy

#### [Submission URL](https://terriblesoftware.org/2025/10/24/chatgpt-said-this-is-lazy/) | 81 points | by [ragswag](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ragswag) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45695841)

“‘ChatGPT said this’ Is Lazy” argues that pasting AI output into PRs, design docs, or Slack isn’t feedback—it’s offloading thinking. The author’s core point: AI lacks your team’s context, constraints, and accountability, so unfiltered AI advice creates extra work and worse decisions. Good reviews are specific, contextual, and owned by the reviewer. Use AI to explore or clarify, but translate insights into your own words and explain why they matter for this codebase.

Takeaways:
- Don’t paste AI verbatim; synthesize. If AI helped, state your point and why it applies here.
- Be concrete: cite the exact code/behavior, impact, and a feasible alternative (e.g., “This is O(n²); use a hash map because our dataset will be 1M+ rows.”).
- Remember accountability: your name is on the review, not the model’s.

The Hacker News discussion on the submission "‘ChatGPT said this’ Is Lazy" reveals nuanced debates about AI's role in technical work:

1. **AI vs. Human Effort**:  
   - Many compare uncritical AI use to low-effort Googling, where users bypass research/validation. Some argue AI responses can be as dismissive as pasting search results, while others note ChatGPT’s efficiency in generating plausible answers when used thoughtfully.  
   - Frustration arises when coworkers spam discussions with raw AI outputs, seen as "clogging" conversations without meaningful contribution.

2. **Accountability & Disclosure**:  
   - Disclosing AI use is divisive: some view it as courteous transparency, others as unnecessary if the answer is correct. Critics warn that over-disclosure risks deflecting responsibility ("It’s ChatGPT’s fault"), while proponents stress owning one’s input regardless of its origin.

3. **Skill Erosion Concerns**:  
   - Heavy reliance on AI risks eroding problem-solving skills and making engineers replaceable. One user analogizes it to GPS weakening spatial reasoning—AI might streamline tasks but could dull critical thinking if overused.  
   - Others counter that AI augments productivity when treated as a tool (e.g., brainstorming drafts), not a final authority.

4. **Technical Limitations**:  
   - LLMs’ inability to fact-check or grasp context is highlighted. Hallucinations and inaccuracies necessitate human validation, akin to verifying Wikipedia claims.  
   - Comparisons to Stack Overflow emphasize that AI should assist, not replace, domain expertise and structured research.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:  
   - Anecdotes illustrate real-world fallout: consultants using AI-generated names faced instant rejection, underscoring the need for scrutiny. Others note generational divides, with juniors over-relying on AI versus seniors prioritizing deeper analysis.  

**Consensus**: AI is powerful for exploration and drafting but must be synthesized, contextualized, and owned by the user. The line between "lazy" and "efficient" hinges on whether AI enhances human judgment or replaces it.

### ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02361) | 89 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45693591)

- TL;DR: The authors add lightweight “QK Adapters” to each transformer layer and a “Chunk Adapter” at the bottom to detect semantic chunk boundaries. They then attend only to selected chunks at boundary tokens. With the backbone frozen and adapters trained via attention distillation, they report up to 4.48x speedups on 120K-token inputs while retaining 98.64% of long-context performance and keeping only ~48.6% of the KV cache.

What’s new
- Pluggable adapters: Q-Adapter and K-Adapter per layer compress features and learn which past chunks matter; a Chunk Adapter at the input finds chunk boundaries using context.
- Frozen backbone: Only adapters are trained, making it easy to retrofit existing LLMs.
- Attention distillation: Trains the QK adapters to recover “key chunks,” aiming to avoid semantic loss seen in prior block-selection/compression methods.
- Event-driven selection: Chunk selection is triggered only at detected boundaries, reducing attention computations and KV cache growth.

Why it matters
- Long-context inference is dominated by quadratic attention and ballooning KV caches. This approach promises practical speed and memory wins without full model retraining.
- If broadly compatible, it could be a drop-in way to make long-context chat, code, and retrieval-heavy workloads cheaper and faster.

Reported results
- Speed: Up to 4.48x faster than a vanilla Transformer on 120K-token sequences.
- Quality: Comparable on short-text tasks; 98.64% of baseline performance on long-context benchmarks.
- Memory: KV cache retention of 48.58% versus the full cache, suggesting significant memory savings.

Open questions for practitioners
- Generality: How well does chunk detection and adapter training transfer across model sizes, domains, and architectures (e.g., RoPE variants, multi-query attention)?
- Overhead vs. gains: What is the latency/throughput trade-off in real-world serving (batching, streaming generation)?
- Training cost: How expensive is adapter training and data prep, and does performance hold on open-ended generation beyond the benchmarks?
- Compatibility: Interaction with other efficiency tricks (FlashAttention, paged KV cache, speculative decoding, retrieval-augmented prompting).

Paper: “ChunkLLM: A Lightweight Pluggable Framework for Accelerating LLMs Inference” (arXiv:2510.02361).

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Limitations & Trade-offs:**  
   - User `djldmn` highlights that Figure 5 in the paper suggests diminishing returns for very long contexts (e.g., slower performance at 30k tokens).  
   - `snwfld` adds that ultra-long contexts might interfere with existing RAG workflows, where models typically process smaller windows and rely on retrieval systems for larger documents.  

2. **Technical Concerns:**  
   - `ProofHouse` questions whether the approach accounts for “attention sink” concepts (managing irrelevant tokens) and raises concerns about latency overhead. They compare it to DeepSeek’s methods, implying potential redundancy with existing techniques.  

3. **Practicality & Broader Impact:**  
   - `Vipsy` views frameworks like ChunkLLM as part of a trend shifting complexity to hardware, noting trade-offs between cost, performance, and compatibility with evolving tech. They express interest in real-world plugin applications.  

4. **Positive Reception:**  
   - `Nav_Panel` praises the technique’s focus on efficient long-context handling.  
   - `tblkh` applauds the reported 4x speed gain with minimal quality loss (~2%), calling it promising.  

**Key Themes:**  
- Skepticism about scalability to extreme contexts (100k+ tokens) and integration with existing systems (RAG).  
- Debate over whether the approach introduces new overheads or duplicates prior work.  
- Optimism about speed gains and practicality for real-world use cases.

### Fast-DLLM: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22618) | 69 points | by [nathan-barry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nathan-barry) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45690219)

- What’s new: A training-free way to speed up diffusion-based LLMs by (1) introducing a block-wise approximate KV cache for bidirectional diffusion models, and (2) using a confidence-aware parallel decoding strategy that only emits tokens above a confidence threshold to avoid breaking token dependencies.
- Why it matters: Diffusion LLMs promise parallel, non-autoregressive generation but have lagged in real-world speed. Bringing KV caching (long a staple for autoregressive models) plus smarter parallel decoding narrows that gap without retraining.
- Results: On LLaDA and Dream across multiple LLM benchmarks, the authors report up to 27.6× throughput gains with minimal accuracy loss, claiming parity with autoregressive inference speeds in practice.
- How it works:
  - Block-wise approximate KV cache: reuses attention key/value states across diffusion steps in a way compatible with bidirectional conditioning.
  - Confidence-aware decoding: selectively parallel-decodes only high-confidence tokens to reduce dependency violations that usually degrade quality.
- Takeaway: If these results hold broadly, diffusion LLMs become far more practical for latency- and cost-sensitive deployments, retaining parallelism while closing the speed gap with standard autoregressive models.

Paper: “Fast-dLLM: Training-free Acceleration of Diffusion LLM by Enabling KV Cache and Parallel Decoding” (arXiv:2505.22618)

**Summary of Discussion:**  
A user ("ProofHouse") questions the speed claims of diffusion-based LLMs compared to traditional architectures. Another user ("grtntr") clarifies that while diffusion LLMs use **parallel decoding**, their bidirectional generation (needing to account for future/past tokens) inherently slows inference. For example, generating a 128-token window might require 128 diffusion steps.  

Replies highlight the paper’s proposed solutions:  
- ("yrwb") The method **dynamically adjusts the number of tokens decoded in parallel** using confidence thresholds and KV caching, balancing speed and quality without strict token-by-token generation.  
- ("am17an") Emphasizes that **parallel decoding** itself is key to the gains.  

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion underscores skepticism about diffusion LLM speeds and clarifies how the paper’s innovations (adaptive parallel decoding + KV caching) address bottlenecks tied to bidirectional generation.

### The Mainframe Six (2022)

#### [Submission URL](https://arcanesciences.com/os2200/app1.html) | 52 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45695956)

The “Mainframe Six” today: a 2022 snapshot of who’s left, where they sell, and how they run

- Big picture: Only six mainframe vendors remain—IBM, Unisys, Fujitsu, Hitachi, Atos/Bull, and NEC. Just three (IBM, NEC, Fujitsu) still design their own CPUs, and even Fujitsu may have only one more generation in it. Much of the non-IBM world runs on emulation, and customer counts are in the hundreds to low thousands. Estimates below are the author’s.

- IBM Z: Global and dominant, with roughly 3,000–7,000 customers. Scales to far higher core counts and performance than the rest.

- Unisys: Two lines—MCP (banking/telecom, stronger in Latin America) and OS 2200 (airline/government, more in East Asia). Custom CPUs ended in the early 2010s; both now use fast emulators. Rough counts: 800–1,200 MCP sites; fewer for OS 2200. Fun ISA trivia: MCP is descriptor-based; OS 2200 is 36-bit, ones’ complement.

- Fujitsu: Global except North America, with several families. BS2000 (ex-Siemens, concentrated in Germany) and GS21 (semi-IBM-compatible, Japan) share 390-based custom CPUs. The ICL/VME 29-series (descriptor machines) lives on mostly in UK finance/gov via long-running emulation. Estimated 1,000–1,500 customers, majority in Japan.

- Hitachi: Now Japan-only. Built custom CPUs until ~2020; latest AP10000 rebadges IBM Z hardware, running Hitachi’s MVS-derived VOS3. Estimated 200–300 sites, almost all in Japan.

- Atos/Bull: Two incompatible lines—GCOS 7 (32-bit, EBCDIC, vaguely MVS-like, POSIX used for TCP/IP; emulated on x86) and GCOS 8 (ASCII, 36-bit; emulated on Itanium). Fewer than 100 total sites, mostly Western Europe.

- NEC: ACOS-4 (a distant cousin of GCOS 7). Still ships custom processors—up to 48 cores and 256 GB RAM. Historically some sales outside Japan; today mostly domestic. Estimated 200–400 sites.

Takeaways: IBM towers over a patchwork of regional, legacy-rich ecosystems. Japan remains a stronghold for non-IBM mainframes. Many once-exotic ISAs persist via emulation, with custom silicon increasingly rare.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Mainframe Six" article highlights several key themes and debates:

### **1. Mainframes vs. Cloud Migration Challenges**  
- **Cost and Complexity**: Users argue that transitioning from mainframes to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS) is fraught with hidden costs, legacy integration challenges, and organizational inertia. While cloud billing models appeal to modern businesses, mainframes still offer lower **Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)** for specific workloads, especially when factoring in decades-old systems deeply embedded in industries like banking and government.  
- **IBM’s Dominance**: Critics note IBM’s aggressive billing practices ("millions upfront"), but defenders highlight mainframes’ unmatched reliability and performance for transaction-heavy workloads compared to distributed systems like SAP HANA or Oracle Exadata.  

### **2. Technical Advantages of Mainframes**  
- **Redundancy & Reliability**: Mainframes excel in disaster recovery (e.g., IBM’s **Parallel Sysplex** and **GDPS**), offering near-zero downtime and data loss (RTO/RPO = 0). Users contrast this with cloud providers’ AZ/region redundancy, which may not match the physical resilience of dedicated mainframe facilities.  
- **Architecture**: Modern IBM mainframes (e.g., z16) are compared to distributed systems, using LPARs/VMs and liquid cooling for efficiency. However, critics point to outdated practices like **36-bit addressing** and legacy constraints (e.g., file systems designed for "cylinders").  

### **3. Skills and Cultural Challenges**  
- **Specialized Expertise**: Operating mainframes requires niche skills (e.g., zOS, COBOL), creating a talent gap as older experts retire. Cloud platforms, while easier to learn, lack equivalent transaction-processing expertise.  
- **Organizational Resistance**: Anecdotes highlight cultural clashes, such as VAX systems being replaced by IBM mainframes in the 1990s, and modern executives’ reluctance to abandon proven (if archaic) systems.  

### **4. Vendor Landscape and Legacy**  
- **Non-IBM Vendors**: Fujitsu, Hitachi, and NEC cling to shrinking niches (notably in Japan). Atos/Bull and Unisys rely on emulation, with customer bases dwindling to sub-100 sites.  
- **Nostalgia and Trivia**: Users reminisce about defunct vendors (e.g., Burroughs, CDC) and debate whether IBM is fundamentally a "marketing company" or a tech innovator, given its patents and Nobel Prize ties.  

### **5. Hybrid Futures**  
- **Cloud Integration**: IBM’s zOS cloud offerings ($5/hour) and emulators like Hercules hint at hybrid models, but adoption is hindered by complexity. Some suggest mainframes will persist as legacy "bridges" until core applications are rewritten—a costly, multi-decade endeavor.  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The discussion underscores mainframes’ paradoxical role: simultaneously criticized as relics and lauded as irreplaceable pillars of critical infrastructure. While cloud platforms advance, mainframes’ reliability, transaction efficiency, and entrenched legacy ensure their survival—for now.

### Disable AI in Firefox

Firefox rolls out AI by default; here’s how to turn it off
A Firefox user documents that Mozilla has begun enabling new AI features by default—think highlight-to-chat popups, a sidebar chatbot, link previews, a “page assist” summarizer, and AI-powered Smart Tab Groups. If you find them distracting, the master kill switch is in about:config: set browser.ml.enable to false. Prefer granular control? Keep that on and toggle specific prefs:

- Chat UI: browser.ml.chat.enabled, browser.ml.chat.sidebar, browser.ml.chat.shortcuts, browser.ml.chat.page, browser.ml.chat.menu, plus the page/footer badges (browser.ml.chat.page.footerBadge, browser.ml.chat.page.menuBadge)
- Link previews: browser.ml.linkPreview.enabled
- Page summarizer/assistant: browser.ml.pageAssist.enabled
- Extensions access to ML API: extensions.ml.enabled
- Smart Tab Groups: browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled (and user toggle: browser.tabs.groups.smart.userEnable)

The author is opting to try Smart Tab Groups while disabling the rest and promises a follow-up on how well it organizes messy tab jungles.

The Hacker News discussion about Firefox’s new AI features reveals mixed reactions and broader concerns:

1. **Criticism of AI Integration**:  
   Many users express frustration over Mozilla enabling AI features by default, viewing them as unnecessary bloat. Some argue Mozilla should prioritize core browser performance over "gimmicks" like chatbots and link previews. Comparisons are drawn to Chromium’s dominance, with skepticism about Firefox’s ability to compete while diverting resources to AI.

2. **Technical Workarounds**:  
   Users share tips for disabling AI features via `about:config` settings, though some lament the increasing complexity of Firefox’s configuration system. Specific flags like `browser.ml.chat.enabled` and `browser.tabs.groups.smart.enabled` are highlighted for granular control.

3. **Local vs. Cloud AI**:  
   Debate arises over on-device AI models. While some praise local processing (e.g., translation tools still working without cloud dependencies), others question the practicality and efficiency of current implementations, suggesting they’re not yet mature enough to justify inclusion.

4. **Mozilla’s Priorities**:  
   Criticism targets Mozilla’s leadership, including the CEO’s high salary and perceived misallocation of funds toward AI instead of improving Gecko/Servo or privacy features. Concerns about Mozilla’s sustainability and alignment with its original mission surface repeatedly.

5. **Browser Alternatives**:  
   Alternatives like **Waterfox** (privacy-focused) and **Ladybird** (a newer engine) are suggested, though doubts linger about their viability against Chromium’s dominance. Nostalgia for older browsers like Netscape and Phoenix underscores frustration with modern bloat.

6. **Search Engine Distrust**:  
   Some users report switching from DuckDuckGo due to declining quality and over-reliance on AI, while others recommend niche engines like `ndckdckgcm` or proxy tools to avoid Google/Bing results.

7. **Engineering Challenges**:  
   Comments acknowledge the immense difficulty of developing a modern browser, with references to WebKit’s origins and the sheer scale of code required. Skeptics argue that Mozilla’s compromises are inevitable but lament the loss of a truly independent, high-performance browser.

Overall, the discussion reflects a community torn between technical pragmatism, nostalgia for simpler software, and skepticism toward Mozilla’s strategic choices in a Chromium-dominated landscape.
