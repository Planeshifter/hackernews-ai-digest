### Seven Dyson Sphere Candidates

#### [Submission URL](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2024/05/18/seven-dyson-sphere-candidates/) | 173 points | by [sohkamyung](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sohkamyung) | [298 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40397823)

The latest buzz on Hacker News is all about Dyson sphere candidates! Astronomers are abuzz with excitement over seven potential candidates for Dyson spheres, megastructures that could one day enclose stars to harness their energy. The discussion revolves around Project Hephaistos' latest paper in 2024, where researchers analyze infrared signatures of these candidates, hinting at possible extraterrestrial civilizations advanced enough to build such structures.

The paper delves into the complexities of photometry in detecting Dyson spheres, as it involves measuring light across different wavelengths to infer properties like distance, temperature, and composition. Modeling the effects of a Dyson sphere on a star's photometry requires accounting for both obscuration of the star and re-emission of absorbed radiation at longer wavelengths due to the megastructure's heat.

The team behind Project Hephaistos leveraged data from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE to identify stars potentially hosting Dyson spheres, focusing on partial spheres that partially obscure the star's light. By scrutinizing mid-infrared signatures for excess heat, they sifted through millions of models to pinpoint seven candidates that seem to be genuine infrared sources free of contamination.

While the researchers are cautious to label these sources as Dyson spheres, the tantalizing possibility of alien megastructures lurking among the stars sparks curiosity and contemplation within the scientific community. Stay tuned as astronomers continue to unravel the mysteries of these enigmatic candidates and push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos.

Today on TechTalks, we delve into the challenges neural networks face when attempting to tackle the famous Game of Life automaton. Developed by British mathematician John Conway, the Game of Life is a grid-based system where cells transition between life and death based on simple rules. Despite its straightforward nature, neural networks struggle to learn the game effectively, as highlighted in a recent research paper by AI experts from Swarthmore College and the Los Alamos National Laboratory.

The experiment involved training a neural network to predict cell states in the Game of Life grid. While a hand-crafted model could achieve this with precision, training a neural network from scratch failed to consistently replicate these results, even with a million training examples. The study underscores the challenges deep learning models face in grasping the underlying rules of complex systems like the Game of Life, offering valuable insights for future AI research.

This in-depth analysis of neural networks' struggle with the Game of Life sheds light on the limitations of current AI technologies and hints at potential directions for further exploration within the field. Stay tuned for more captivating insights from the world of artificial intelligence on TechTalks.
