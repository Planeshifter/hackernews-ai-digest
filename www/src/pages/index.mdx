### Watching o3 guess a photo's location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/) | 911 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [400 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43803243)

Over at Simon Willison’s Weblog, there's an eye-opening dive into the fascinating capabilities of OpenAI's new o3 model—a tool that blurs the line between thrilling tech and speculative fiction. The o3 model can analyze a photo and make educated guesses about its location, akin to the sci-fi 'Enhance Button' trope. In this particular experiment, a photo taken near Simon's home in El Granada, California, was submitted to test the model.

Initially, the model amusingly claimed it couldn’t "see" the image and needed to rely on metadata. However, it quickly shifted gears and employed its visual analysis skills. The AI impressively deduced characteristics from the image, noticing California poppies, olive trees, and coastal architecture typical of the Central Coast.

In a scene straight out of science fiction, the AI pretended to zoom into the license plate for more clues, employing Python code to crop and analyze different sections of the photo. This ‘zooming’ feature is part of its toolkit, providing more accurate insights.

The grand finale? It correctly identified the scene as Central Coast California, though it initially guessed Cambria rather than the actual location of El Granada. The AI’s first instinct wasn't spot-on, but its second guess hit the bullseye. This functionality is available on the $20/month Plus plan for eager testers.

Interestingly, some users have noted the possibility of the model using EXIF data, although Simon's experiment seems to negate this due to its location approximation. This ability to guess location isn’t unique to o3; other models like Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet similarly wow with their interpretations, albeit with less of that dramatic "zoom."

What sets o3 apart is its integration of tool usage into the problem-solving "thinking" phase, making its operations feel like science fiction manifesting in our daily tech experiences. While the practical effectiveness of the extensive zooming is debatable, it certainly adds to the engaging mystique of these AI advancements.

The Hacker News discussion around OpenAI’s image-analysis capabilities and broader AI implications reveals several key themes:

1. **AI’s Image Analysis Prowess**:  
   Users compared OpenAI’s o3 model to *Geoguessr*, praising its ability to infer locations from photos based on visual cues like vegetation, architecture, and infrastructure. While the model initially misidentified El Granada as Cambria, its iterative "zooming" technique (akin to sci-fi "enhance" tropes) impressed commenters. Some noted parallels with Claude 3.5/3.7’s abilities but highlighted o3’s unique integration of tool usage during analysis.

2. **Software Engineering Use Cases**:  
   - **Code Assistance**: AI models like Claude and Gemini excel at generating boilerplate code, CRUD apps, and simple scripts but struggle with complex, legacy codebases. Users debated whether AI could replace nuanced human reasoning in debugging or architectural decisions.  
   - **Debugging Success**: One user shared a positive experience using Gemini 25 Pro to debug a multi-layered issue, crediting its long-context analysis and chain-of-thought prompting.  
   - **Architecture Debates**: Microservices vs. monolithic systems resurfaced, with some arguing that AI’s context-window limitations might favor modular code, while others dismissed microservices as overhyped.  

3. **Economic and Workforce Implications**:  
   - Predictions ranged from gradual adoption (20–30 years for legacy systems like AS400 to phase out) to concerns about AI disrupting low-stakes industries first.  
   - Contrasting views emerged: HN commenters often critiqued AI’s limitations, while non-technical users reportedly find its output "magical." Jobs involving repetitive tasks (e.g., CMS configuration, basic integrations) were seen as vulnerable, but complex, creative engineering roles remain safer—for now.  

4. **Broader Speculations**:  
   - Some imagined an AGI-driven future where AI reshapes industrial workflows, while skeptics emphasized persistent challenges (e.g., physical-world interactions).  
   - Ethical and practical questions arose about AI’s potential to "memorize" code patterns from public repositories, raising concerns about originality and security.  

The discussion underscored both excitement for AI’s evolving capabilities and skepticism about its readiness for high-stakes, nuanced tasks. While tools like o3 and Gemini dazzle with near-sci-fi features, their real-world utility remains bounded by context limitations and the irreplaceable role of human intuition in complex problem-solving.

   - While neural networks (NNs) excel in perception and planning, they struggle with **real-time adaptation** and replicating human-like common sense. Current models often require extensive manual tuning and lack the ability to handle "edge cases" in dynamic environments.
   - OpenAI’s Rubik’s Cube-solving robot was cited as an example where simulation and domain randomization helped, but transferring such successes to the real world remains challenging. Participants critiqued end-to-end ML approaches, arguing for modular systems that separate perception, planning, and control.

3. **Simulation vs. Real-World Data**:
   - Simulations (e.g., MuJoCo, PyBullet) are crucial for training robots, but progress in improving their accuracy has been slow. Participants noted that even vast training data in simulations may not capture real-world complexity, unlike language models trained on extensive human knowledge.
   - Waymo’s approach to autonomous vehicles, which relies heavily on real-world data collection, was contrasted with robotics’ reliance on simulations, highlighting scalability challenges.

4. **Biological Inspiration vs. Robotic Constraints**:
   - Human and animal dexterity leverages **sensory feedback loops and adaptable biology** (e.g., flexible fingertips, neural plasticity) that are difficult to replicate in rigid robotic systems. Comments pointed out that biological systems handle uncertainty and learning in ways current robotics cannot.
   - Surgical robots, despite their precision, still fall short of mimicking human surgeons’ adaptability, underscoring the gap between mimicry and true functional equivalence.

5. **Future Directions**:
   - Suggestions included **continuous learning systems** (akin to lifelong learning in humans) and hybrid models combining classical robotics with adaptive ML. Others stressed the need for better hardware (e.g., softer, more sensitive grippers) and interdisciplinary collaboration to tackle challenges like real-time physics modeling.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism. While advancements in ML and simulations are driving progress, achieving human-level dexterity in robots remains a daunting task requiring breakthroughs in hardware, software, and our understanding of embodied intelligence.
