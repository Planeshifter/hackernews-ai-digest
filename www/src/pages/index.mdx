### Do Large Language Models know who did what to whom?

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16884) | 34 points | by [badmonster](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=badmonster) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43813879)

In a fascinating new study titled "Do Large Language Models Know Who Did What to Whom?" researchers Joseph M. Denning and his colleagues delve into the intricacies of language understanding by large language models (LLMs). The paper addresses the ongoing debate about whether LLMs truly "understand" language or merely process it. The authors focus specifically on a fundamental linguistic concept: thematic roles, which involve determining the agent and patient in a sentence—essentially, "who did what to whom."

The team conducted experiments on four different LLMs to analyze how well they capture these thematic roles. Surprisingly, they discovered that while humans tend to link sentence similarity to thematic roles, these models predominantly associate similarity with syntax alone, often overlooking thematic structures. Interestingly, some attention mechanisms within the models did manage to isolate thematic roles, suggesting that LLMs possess a latent ability to understand such language constructs, albeit less consistently than humans.

The paper provides significant insights into how LLMs construct "meaning" and highlights the nuanced differences in language understanding between artificial and human cognition. If you're intrigued by the intersection of computational language models and cognitive science, this study offers a rich exploration of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs regarding sentence comprehension. For further details, you can access the full paper via arXiv [doi:10.48550/arXiv.2504.16884](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2504.16884).

**Discussion Summary:**

1. **User 112233** questions whether LLMs truly understand narrative roles ("who did what to whom") or merely mimic patterns. They suggest models might superficially swap characters (e.g., agents and patients) while relying on syntactic structures rather than deeper thematic understanding. A reply by **NoToP** provides an example involving air traffic control transcripts, where a character’s role (e.g., "Y talking to traffic control") highlights potential inconsistencies in how models handle agent-patient assignments.

2. **bdmnstr** shares a direct link to the arXiv paper for reference.

3. **kzntr** argues that LLMs excel at preserving meaning in tasks like translation, implying syntactic competence. **chwxy** elaborates by summarizing the study’s key findings:
   - **Experiment 1**: LLMs prioritize syntax over thematic roles when assessing sentence similarity, unlike humans, who focus on meaning.
   - **Experiment 2**: Thematic role information is faintly detectable in some hidden layers and attention heads, enabling limited classification of sentences by roles. However, this capability is inconsistent and generally inferior to human performance, except in specific descriptive cases where attention heads surprisingly outperformed humans.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion underscores skepticism about LLMs’ grasp of thematic roles, emphasizing their syntactic bias. While some attention mechanisms show latent potential for role-based understanding, humans remain more robust at integrating meaning and context.

### AI Coding assistants provide little value because a programmer's job is to think

#### [Submission URL](https://www.doliver.org/articles/programming-is-a-thinkers-game) | 98 points | by [d0liver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=d0liver) | [183 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43815033)

In a recent critique, a developer highlights the gap between written code and the actual running programs, using a JavaScript example to drive home the point. This particular code snippet raises several issues about execution context, dependency on external functions, and the implicit nature of many JavaScript actions. The main argument is that while code may appear functional, many underlying complexities exist that aren't visible in the code itself. These include understanding browser behaviors, version compatibility, and the setup of event-driven programming, all of which require significant human reasoning.

The article further critiques the notion of AI-driven code generation, suggesting that these tools often churn out syntactically correct but logically flawed snippets. Since AI lacks deep understanding and reasoning capabilities, it tends to create code that might look right but falls short in practice, especially for non-trivial tasks. The complexity of integrating AI-generated code into real-world applications, needing human verification and corrections, often outweighs any time savings from automated generation.

Moreover, the article argues that successful software engineering is less about the act of writing code and more about understanding, discussing, and filling in the gaps that machine-generated code cannot acknowledge. Established modules, open source projects, and community-generated example codes remain invaluable assets because they provide context, documentation, and thoughtful abstractions necessary for high-quality software development.

In conclusion, the piece echoes the sentiment of Linux creator Linus Torvalds: real programming challenges require a deep understanding of the system, beyond the mere ability to write code. Debuggers, modules, and community resources help programmers focus on "the meaning of things," rather than the minutiae, ultimately elevating their craft above simple code generation.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the limitations and challenges of AI-generated code, centering on its inability to fully grasp context, dependencies, and domain-specific complexities. Key themes include:  

1. **AI as a Time-Saver, Not a Silver Bullet**:  
   - Many users report using LLMs (e.g., Claude, GPT) for boilerplate code, bug fixes, or repetitive tasks, saving hours of work. However, results often require significant human intervention for edge cases, debugging, and refining.

2. **Contextual Understanding Falls Short**:  
   - AI struggles with deep technical reasoning, such as understanding low-level system interactions (e.g., JSON parsing, configuration files) or niche frameworks/tools (e.g., Zig, Zephyr RTOS). Users highlight failures when AI lacks access to indexed documentation or misinterprats implicit project requirements.

3. **Testing and Code Quality**:  
   - While AI can generate code quickly, users emphasize the importance of rigorous testing. Tests written by humans (or explicitly guided by humans) are critical for ensuring robustness, as AI-generated tests may miss edge cases or produce misleading coverage metrics.

4. **Domain Complexity and Specialization**:  
   - In complex domains like finance, embedded systems, or legacy codebases, AI often falters. One developer notes how AI failed to handle C++ data structures or Qt UI intricacies, requiring manual problem-solving despite prompts.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**:  
   - Developers stress that AI tools are most effective when paired with human expertise. For example, AI might propose a fix, but developers must verify it and fill in gaps through deeper technical analysis. Over-reliance leads to "code monkeys pasting LLM output" without true understanding.

6. **Mixed Success in Workflows**:  
   - Some praise LLMs for accelerating tasks like CSV imports or React/Vue conversions, while others find them inadequate for bespoke projects lacking clear documentation. The consensus: AI aids productivity but cannot replace critical thinking or domain knowledge.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores that AI tools are valuable for accelerating repetitive or well-trodden tasks but falter in nuanced, highly specialized, or poorly documented scenarios. Human oversight, domain expertise, and rigorous testing remain indispensable for high-quality software development.

### Watching o3 guess a photo's location is surreal, dystopian and entertaining

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/26/o3-photo-locations/) | 911 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [400 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43803243)

Over at Simon Willison’s Weblog, there's an eye-opening dive into the fascinating capabilities of OpenAI's new o3 model—a tool that blurs the line between thrilling tech and speculative fiction. The o3 model can analyze a photo and make educated guesses about its location, akin to the sci-fi 'Enhance Button' trope. In this particular experiment, a photo taken near Simon's home in El Granada, California, was submitted to test the model.

Initially, the model amusingly claimed it couldn’t "see" the image and needed to rely on metadata. However, it quickly shifted gears and employed its visual analysis skills. The AI impressively deduced characteristics from the image, noticing California poppies, olive trees, and coastal architecture typical of the Central Coast.

In a scene straight out of science fiction, the AI pretended to zoom into the license plate for more clues, employing Python code to crop and analyze different sections of the photo. This ‘zooming’ feature is part of its toolkit, providing more accurate insights.

The grand finale? It correctly identified the scene as Central Coast California, though it initially guessed Cambria rather than the actual location of El Granada. The AI’s first instinct wasn't spot-on, but its second guess hit the bullseye. This functionality is available on the $20/month Plus plan for eager testers.

Interestingly, some users have noted the possibility of the model using EXIF data, although Simon's experiment seems to negate this due to its location approximation. This ability to guess location isn’t unique to o3; other models like Claude 3.5 and 3.7 Sonnet similarly wow with their interpretations, albeit with less of that dramatic "zoom."

What sets o3 apart is its integration of tool usage into the problem-solving "thinking" phase, making its operations feel like science fiction manifesting in our daily tech experiences. While the practical effectiveness of the extensive zooming is debatable, it certainly adds to the engaging mystique of these AI advancements.

The Hacker News discussion around OpenAI’s image-analysis capabilities and broader AI implications reveals several key themes:

1. **AI’s Image Analysis Prowess**:  
   Users compared OpenAI’s o3 model to *Geoguessr*, praising its ability to infer locations from photos based on visual cues like vegetation, architecture, and infrastructure. While the model initially misidentified El Granada as Cambria, its iterative "zooming" technique (akin to sci-fi "enhance" tropes) impressed commenters. Some noted parallels with Claude 3.5/3.7’s abilities but highlighted o3’s unique integration of tool usage during analysis.

2. **Software Engineering Use Cases**:  
   - **Code Assistance**: AI models like Claude and Gemini excel at generating boilerplate code, CRUD apps, and simple scripts but struggle with complex, legacy codebases. Users debated whether AI could replace nuanced human reasoning in debugging or architectural decisions.  
   - **Debugging Success**: One user shared a positive experience using Gemini 25 Pro to debug a multi-layered issue, crediting its long-context analysis and chain-of-thought prompting.  
   - **Architecture Debates**: Microservices vs. monolithic systems resurfaced, with some arguing that AI’s context-window limitations might favor modular code, while others dismissed microservices as overhyped.  

3. **Economic and Workforce Implications**:  
   - Predictions ranged from gradual adoption (20–30 years for legacy systems like AS400 to phase out) to concerns about AI disrupting low-stakes industries first.  
   - Contrasting views emerged: HN commenters often critiqued AI’s limitations, while non-technical users reportedly find its output "magical." Jobs involving repetitive tasks (e.g., CMS configuration, basic integrations) were seen as vulnerable, but complex, creative engineering roles remain safer—for now.  

4. **Broader Speculations**:  
   - Some imagined an AGI-driven future where AI reshapes industrial workflows, while skeptics emphasized persistent challenges (e.g., physical-world interactions).  
   - Ethical and practical questions arose about AI’s potential to "memorize" code patterns from public repositories, raising concerns about originality and security.  

The discussion underscored both excitement for AI’s evolving capabilities and skepticism about its readiness for high-stakes, nuanced tasks. While tools like o3 and Gemini dazzle with near-sci-fi features, their real-world utility remains bounded by context limitations and the irreplaceable role of human intuition in complex problem-solving.

### Robot Dexterity Still Seems Hard

#### [Submission URL](https://www.construction-physics.com/p/robot-dexterity-still-seems-hard) | 64 points | by [mhb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mhb) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43805683)

In a world where humanoid robots are increasingly becoming a reality, the quest for achieving significant robot dexterity remains a formidable challenge. Despite notable strides in robot design and capabilities, the path to mastering human-like manipulation is still rocky. As detailed in a post by Brian Potter, an influx of pioneering companies, from startups to established corporations like Tesla and Boston Dynamics, are fervently developing these mechanical beings, investing billions of dollars along the way.

The excitement around humanoids is undeniable, with some showcasing neck-breaking acrobatics and even competing in a humanoid half marathon in Beijing. Robots like Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and Unitree's G1 have amazed audiences with stunts and smooth walking gaits, emulating human movement with uncanny precision. Yet, these flashy demos often overshadow the real bottleneck in humanoid robotics: dexterity.

Dexterity is key for humanoids to transition from spectacle to practical utility. While robots excel at tasks requiring precision and repetition, they struggle to handle the spontaneous and versatile manipulation tasks that humans do with ease. When it comes to grasping and maneuvering diverse objects in real-time, the machines fall short, a classic case of Moravec’s Paradox, where seemingly simple tasks for humans prove to be intricate puzzles for robots.

Interestingly, applications of humanoids in real-world settings are emerging. Robots like Agility Robotics’ Digit and Apptronik’s Apollo are already laboring in warehouses and assembly lines, performing tasks that involve object movement rather than manipulation. Companies like 1X with its Neo robot are pushing boundaries further, experimenting with household chores as part of data-gathering projects aimed at refining their robots' abilities.

While the journey to replicate or even surpass human-like dexterity in robots is far from over, the industry continues to advance at a brisk pace. With sustained innovation and relentless pursuit, it's plausible that humanoid robots might soon wield the dexterity needed to transform them from impressive prototypes to indispensable aides in daily life.

The Hacker News discussion on the challenges of robot dexterity revolves around several key themes and insights:

1. **Complexity of Physical Interaction**:
   - Participants emphasized the difficulty of modeling **contact dynamics, friction, and object manipulation** in unstructured environments. Real-world scenarios involve variable factors (e.g., soft/hard objects, surface textures, and force sensitivity) that are computationally intensive to simulate and hard for robots to generalize.
