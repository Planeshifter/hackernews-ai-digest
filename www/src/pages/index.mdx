### I deleted my second brain

#### [Submission URL](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/p/i-deleted-my-second-brain) | 529 points | by [MrVandemar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MrVandemar) | [324 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44402470)

In a bold move against the tide of digital hoarding, Joan Westenberg recently erased her entire "second brain"—a meticulously curated collection of over 10,000 digital notes compiled over seven years. This vast trove of insights, quotes, and ideas, stored in systems like Obsidian and Apple Notes, was meant to enhance her productivity and creativity by capturing every fleeting thought. However, it became clear that instead of empowering her, it had turned into an oppressive weight stifling her curiosity and genuine thought processes.

The concept of a "second brain," popular among productivity enthusiasts, promises clarity and enhanced memory by externalizing and organizing one's thinking into a digital network. Yet, Westenberg found this system morphed into a mausoleum of past ideas and identities, diminishing her mental agility and curiosity. In her reflective journey, largely influenced by her sobriety milestones, she realized that true progress came not from archived notes but from lived experiences and personal evolution.

Citing cultural and psychological insights, Westenberg critiques the misconception that human memory functions like static data storage. Human cognition, she argues, thrives on the chaos and fluidity of life, not on rigidly categorized files. The promise of total capture through Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) systems often results in stored but unreflected upon ideas, creating an illusion of mastery without true understanding.

Furthermore, she addresses the guilt associated with unread reading lists, recognizing that her vast database of unread material served more as a monument to her ambitions than as a roadmap to wisdom. By letting go of this digital excess, Westenberg embraces a more organic and improvisational approach to learning and growth, one that favors true engagement over mere accumulation.

This act of digital decluttering, she suggests, is a liberating release from the tyranny of productivity tools that can ensnare their users. By returning to a simpler state of mental inquiry and presence, Westenberg champions the value of forgetting as a natural and necessary aspect of genuine knowledge and self-discovery.

In a world obsessed with capturing and categorizing, Westenberg’s story is a refreshing reminder of the power of letting go and trusting one's instincts to guide learning and creativity.

   - Valuing journals or analog notebooks as less overwhelming alternatives to digital PKM tools.  

3. **Technical Debates on Storage**:  
   A tangential thread debated long-term data storage, with users comparing HDDs, SSDs, and magnetic tape (LTO). Tape was noted for its cost-effectiveness and durability for archival purposes, though some questioned its practicality versus cloud storage or periodic data migration.

4. **Psychological Reflections**:  
   Participants explored the emotional weight of digital hoarding, comparing it to physical clutter. Some argued that retaining vast amounts of data creates a "psychological burden," while others admitted struggling with the fear of losing potentially valuable information. The act of decluttering was framed as a way to reclaim mental space and focus on the present.

5. **Nostalgia vs. Progress**:  
   A few users defended revisiting old notes or journals, citing the joy of rediscovering past perspectives. One mentioned how revisiting a 20-year-old HTML project sparked creativity. However, others countered that overly fixating on the past hinders growth, with one quipping, "Sometimes it’s nice to remind yourself you’ve [already] lived."

6. **Humor and Skepticism**:  
   Lighthearted critiques emerged about AI-generated comments (noting their "poetic but hollow" style) and the irony of productivity systems becoming distractions. One user joked that obsessive note-taking often feels like "insight hoarding" rather than genuine learning.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a tension between the desire to capture knowledge and the freedom of letting go. While some advocate for structured systems, many resonate with Westenberg’s conclusion: true growth often lies in lived experience, not archived data. As one user succinctly put it: "Human brains thrive on chaos, not categorization."

### SymbolicAI: A neuro-symbolic perspective on LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai) | 202 points | by [futurisold](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=futurisold) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44399234)

On today's Hacker News, we're spotlighting an exciting new library making waves in the programming community: SymbolicAI by ExtensityAI. This project offers a neuro-symbolic framework that marries the rigor of classical Python programming with the flexibility of Large Language Models (LLMs), all wrapped in a compositional differentiable programming library. It's no wonder the project has garnered 1.3k stars and 63 forks on GitHub! 

SymbolicAI aims to streamline the use of LLMs by introducing two key concepts: 'primitives' and 'contracts'. The heart of the library lies in 'Symbol' objects that can operate in dual modes—syntactic and semantic. The former treats data as traditional Python values, ensuring safety and speed, while the latter taps into the LLM’s depth, allowing for semantic understanding and context-aware operations. This duality facilitates a seamless weave of operations for developers seeking both precision and functionality in handling data.

The use of 'contracts' within SymbolicAI is particularly innovative. Drawing inspiration from Design by Contract principles, these contracts bolster code reliability by embedding correctness directly into design through decorators. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the reliance on post-hoc testing and ensure robust application logic.

With SymbolicAI, developers can harness modular, extensible tools to easily integrate web searches, image generation, and more. It sets a remarkable example of how to make complex LLM interactions feel natural in Python, opening doors for broader adoption and experimentation in AI-driven projects. If you're a developer interested in expanding the capabilities of your applications with neuro-symbolic programming, SymbolicAI might just be worth exploring.

Solutions proposed include **grammar-based constraints** (e.g., JSON schema validation) and leveraging SymbolicAI’s contracts for post-hoc validation.

2. **Contracts & Functional Equivalence**:  
   - The `contracts` concept sparked interest, with users likening them to **design-by-contract principles**. A key insight: contracts ensure LLM outputs meet functional specifications, enabling "equivalence" even if implementations vary. This abstraction could allow swapping LLMs without breaking systems.  
   - One user shared a project using contracts for document generation ([example PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va7ALq_N-fTYeumKhH4jSxsTrWD)), emphasizing their role in validation and system reliability.

3. **Integration with Existing Tools**:  
   - Commenters discussed integrating SymbolicAI with relational data tools (SQL, Splunk), notebooks, and dashboards. A "semantic dataframe" extension was proposed, blending symbolic logic with tabular data operations.  
   - Comparisons to **neuro-symbolic systems** (e.g., Type 3 architectures) highlighted SymbolicAI’s potential to unify neural flexibility with symbolic rigor.

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Philosophical debates emerged around semantics vs. syntax, referencing Peirce’s semiotics and Montague semantics. Users noted SymbolicAI’s alignment with classical symbolic AI but stressed the need for deeper integration with neural components.  
   - Practical critiques included code corrections (e.g., fixing `valid_sizes` in examples) and calls for clearer documentation.

5. **Community Contributions**:  
   - Links to [example notebooks](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai/blob/main/examples) and a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00854) were shared, showcasing SymbolicAI’s versatility in tasks like logical inference and data transformation.

**Takeaway**: SymbolicAI is seen as a promising bridge between classical programming and LLM-driven workflows, but its success hinges on addressing LLM non-determinism, expanding integrations, and fostering community-driven use cases. The discussion reflects optimism tempered with pragmatic technical scrutiny.

### Show HN: PILF, The ultimate solution to catastrophic oblivion on AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/dmf-archive/PILF) | 28 points | by [NetRunnerSu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=NetRunnerSu) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44395810)

Hacker News is abuzz today with a fascinating dive into the world of adaptive learning frameworks, thanks to the open-source project PILF (Predictive Integrity Learning Framework) hosted on GitHub. This innovative framework, inspired by Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT), aims to revolutionize the way models handle training by mitigating the effects of catastrophic forgetting and enhancing efficiency through a Surprise-gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.

At its core, PILF shifts from traditional fixed hyperparameters to dynamic strategies, driven by the "Surprise" of data encountered during training. The framework leverages this concept in several novel ways:

1. **Dynamic Learning Rate:** Unlike static approaches, PILF adjusts the learning rate in real-time based on the Surprise metric, which evaluates the novelty or importance of data. Moderate Surprise results in boosting the learning rate, while too low or too high Surprise sees it nearing zero, effectively ignoring or rejecting inadequate data. This challenges the traditional manually-set learning rate schedulers by allowing the system to "learn" how much to learn dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Capacity Usage:** Within the MoE architecture, the Surprise metric also dictates the number of "experts" activated for a given task. Simple tasks engage fewer experts, while complex tasks necessitate a dynamic enlistment of more, replacing fixed Top-K routing.

The development of PILF is broken down into evolutionary stages, each refining the adaptive capability further. Among those stages is the PILR-S (Predictive Integrity Learning Rate Scheduler), which introduces a sophisticated approach to learning rate adjustment, moving from binary gating logic to smooth continuous modulation.

The PILR-S module operates using a computational toolkit, SigmaPI, to calculate the learning value without waiting for heavy backpropagation processes, enabling a speedy assessment of data worthiness and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

The initiative is open for exploration on GitHub, where the community can examine the project's code, contribute, and witness the progress of adaptive learning frameworks firsthand. Whether you're a seasoned ML engineer or a newcomer, PILF offers a compelling glimpse into the future of smarter, more efficient AI training methodologies.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around PILF explores both enthusiasm and skepticism, focusing on technical nuances and philosophical parallels with human cognition:

1. **Skepticism & Validation:**  
   - Initial comments caution against potential "LARPing" (inauthentic claims), urging scrutiny. Advocates defend PILF’s scientific rigor, emphasizing its basis in Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT) and empirical precision.

2. **Model Stability Concerns:**  
   - Questions arise about whether the "Surprise" metric—steering learning rate adjustments—might destabilize models. Concerns include abrupt changes in gradients or hyperparameters leading to rigidity. A rebuttal likens PILR-S’s learning rate modulation to human psychology: avoiding extreme "surprises" (analogous to trauma) while balancing stability and plasticity.

3. **Cognitive Metaphors:**  
   - Deeper debate compares the framework to human cognition. Critics highlight risks of models becoming dogmatic, mirroring human cognitive rigidity when faced with contradictory data. Proponents counter that hyperparameters like `sigma_threshold` can tune "open-mindedness," balancing skepticism (conservative learning) vs. adaptability (accepting paradigm shifts).

4. **Hyperparameter Dynamics:**  
   - The shift from manual hyperparameter tuning to PILF’s dynamic approach is praised as a breakthrough, though some humorously lament the end of "parameter fiddling." The method is framed as a step toward meta-learning, where models self-optimize strategies over time.

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   - The discussion acknowledges PILF’s potential to bridge machine learning with cognitive science, particularly in understanding intelligence and consciousness through adaptive architectures.

In essence, the conversation balances technical critique with admiration for PILF’s ambition, underscoring challenges in aligning AI adaptability with human-like learning while avoiding pitfalls like instability or rigidity.

In the swirling landscape of AI-driven transformations, Salesforce is boldly accelerating its adoption of artificial intelligence while tech giants are re-evaluating their workforce needs. In a candid conversation with Bloomberg, Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce, revealed that AI now completes up to half of the company's work. However, this forward march comes with its human costs; Salesforce has laid off 1,000 employees, although it plans to hire another 1,000 to focus on selling its AI agent technology, Agentforce.

This scenario isn't unique to Salesforce. Amazon's CEO, Andy Jassy, recently indicated that AI could reduce the necessity for certain roles, in line with a broader tech industry trend toward workforce reductions amidst escalating AI capabilities. Microsoft, Google, and others have implemented layoffs as they channel resources into AI investments. The employment landscape is shifting rapidly, with over 63,000 tech workers laid off in 2025, many victims of AI-induced redundancies.

Commentators like Brian Merchant, author of "Blood in the Machine," highlight the harsh realities of AI's impact on jobs. As companies like Dropbox and CrowdStrike make cuts ostensibly linked to AI replacements, the drive towards AI optimization in Silicon Valley seems to be paradoxically about lessening the human touch while touting innovation. As these changes ripple through the industry, the question of AI’s ultimate role and how humans will adapt looms larger than ever. 

**Summary of workforce changes and broader tech industry trends reveals skepticism and critical analysis:

1. **Skepticism of AI Claims**:  
   - Users question Salesforce's assertion that AI handles 50% of work, suggesting it may be corporate hype. Concerns are raised about the quality and context of AI-generated code, with some noting that metrics like "30-50% AI completion" are vague (does it refer to code written or tasks automated?).  
   - Comparisons are drawn to past overhyped technologies, referencing the **Gartner Hype Cycle** and Salesforce’s stock price being inflated by AI buzz.

2. **Critiques of Salesforce’s Products**:  
   - Salesforce’s CRM is criticized as outdated, likened to "Microsoft Access for the web," with users highlighting frustrations over customization and usability. Competitors like HubSpot and Zoho are seen as more innovative.  
   - The new "Agentforce" AI product is met with skepticism, seen as part of a trend of rebranding rather than genuine innovation.

3. **Job Displacement and Labor Practices**:  
   - Layoffs are framed as part of a broader shift toward prioritizing AI over human labor, with anecdotes about 1990s-era job cuts resurfacing. Critics argue companies exploit the "Puritan work ethic" to justify reducing wages and headcount.  
   - Concerns about **AI’s impact on employment** are tempered by debates over whether AI truly replaces jobs or merely shifts roles, with some noting humans remain essential for complex tasks (e.g., interviews, strategic decisions).

4. **Broader Economic and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Users highlight corporate short-termism, with management prioritizing cost-cutting over workforce quality. Others call for new organizational structures to protect workers in an AI-driven economy.  
   - A subthread critiques the suppression of wages and the need for policy interventions to address AI’s societal impact.

5. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Jokes about AI generating code comments (e.g., "46% of comments") and Bitcoin references add levity, while security concerns and artistic implications of AI are briefly mentioned.

**Overall**: The discussion reflects widespread doubt about AI’s touted benefits, emphasizing corporate accountability, labor rights, and the need for transparency in an era of rapid technological change.
