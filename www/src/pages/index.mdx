In a recent update to the Valhalla JVM prototype, the use of Q-types and v-bytecodes has been removed, resulting in a simpler and more efficient VM design. Q-types were a new type of VM type introduced in Valhalla to support Java value classes, while v-bytecodes were special bytecodes for operating on these Q-types. However, new optimization techniques have made it possible to express struct-like values and their operations using normal Java classes without sacrificing performance. By removing Q-types and v-bytecodes, the VM design has been simplified and allows existing Java classes to operate as if no changes have been made. This has significant benefits for migration and binary compatibility, as it reduces the need for clients of these classes to be recompiled. The goal is to minimize changes to the classfile format and use existing classfile encodings as much as possible, allowing code that previously worked with the class to continue working seamlessly after it has been migrated to a value class. Overall, this update represents a major step forward in the development of Valhalla and its support for Java value classes.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the changes in the Valhalla JVM prototype and the implications for the Java programming language. Some commenters express their interest in the new design and the potential performance improvements it brings.
