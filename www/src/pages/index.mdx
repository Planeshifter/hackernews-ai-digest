### Chain of Thought empowers transformers to solve inherently serial problems

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12875) | 258 points | by [krackers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=krackers) | [175 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41562673)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers Zhiyuan Li and colleagues delve into the "Chain of Thought" (CoT) technique, which enhances the capabilities of transformer models in tackling complex computational tasks that typically require serial processing. While previous work established that transformer models struggle with such tasks, particularly when their depth is limited, this paper offers a theoretical insight into why CoT significantly boosts the models' performance in arithmetic and symbolic reasoning problems.

By examining the expressiveness of constant-depth transformers, the authors reveal that without CoT, these models can only handle simpler problems. However, when provided with intermediate steps through CoT, the depth-limited transformers expand their problem-solving abilities to encompass any issue solvable by boolean circuits of a certain size. The empirical results are compelling, showing substantial accuracy improvements in areas like permutation group composition and circuit value challenges as CoT is employed.

The findings pave the way for deeper understanding and application of CoT in enhancing language models' performance, especially in scenarios difficult for parallel computation. This research was accepted at ICLR 2024 and offers a fresh perspective on the computational potential of transformers.
