### Run CUDA, unmodified, on AMD GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://docs.scale-lang.com/) | 1070 points | by [Straw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Straw) | [315 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40970560)

Today on Hacker News, a new GPGPU programming toolkit called SCALE by Spectral Compute is making waves. SCALE allows CUDA applications to be natively compiled for AMD GPUs without requiring any modifications to the CUDA program or its build system. This innovative toolkit is designed to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA, making it easy for users to leverage their existing codebase for AMD GPUs.

Some key features of SCALE include accepting CUDA programs as-is, no need for porting to another language, and impersonating an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to ensure existing build tools and scripts work seamlessly. The toolkit has been tested with various open-source CUDA projects like NVIDIA Thrust, Blender Cycles, and xgboost, showcasing its capabilities.

In terms of GPU support, SCALE currently covers AMD gfx1030 and gfx1100, with plans to expand support to other AMD GPU architectures in the future. The toolkit comprises components like an nvcc-compatible compiler, implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs, and open-source wrapper libraries for handling CUDA-X APIs.

SCALE's goal is to eliminate the need for maintaining multiple codebases or sacrificing performance to support different GPU vendors. It offers opt-in language extensions to enhance the efficiency of GPU code, providing users with a seamless transition from nvcc to SCALE.

For those interested in learning more or trying out SCALE, there are resources available such as tutorials, examples, and ways to get in touch with the team through Discord or email at [email protected] This toolkit is continuously evolving, with plans to incorporate more features and support for additional GPU architectures in the future.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the new GPGPU programming toolkit SCALE by Spectral Compute delves into various technical aspects and opinions. Some users discuss the challenges of supporting AMD GPUs in contrast to Nvidia due to legal agreements and technical difficulties, while others point out the benefits and complexities of using the toolkit. There is a debate on the efficiency of porting solutions like HIP versus creating new solutions like HIP. Additionally, the conversation touches on the high costs associated with working with CUDA, potential alternatives like AWS instances, and the advantages and disadvantages of investing in CUDA knowledge. Moreover, there are humorous references to the value of gold and light-hearted comments about studying for CUDA and Ancient Rome's use of gold to measure power. Ultimately, the discussion emphasizes the technical intricacies, challenges, and practical considerations surrounding GPGPU programming with SCALE and CUDA.

### Solving Path of Exile Item Crafting with Reinforcement Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://dennybritz.com/posts/poe-crafting/) | 86 points | by [dennybritz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dennybritz) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40958436)

The post dives into the world of Path of Exile (PoE), an intricate ARPG game notorious for its complexity. Crafting in PoE involves modifying item attributes to create powerful gear, but the process is daunting for many due to a high risk of failure. Players often opt to buy items instead of crafting them. The article delves into the question of whether an algorithm can be used to learn the optimal sequence of crafting actions for a target item in PoE.

In PoE, crafting involves changing item modifiers through various actions to achieve a desired outcome. The post explains the mechanics of item modifiers, the limitations on the number of prefixes and suffixes an item can have, and the probability distribution of obtaining modifiers based on the item's base type, level, and existing modifiers.

Crafting in PoE can involve multiple steps, including applying currency or using crafting benches, with outcomes being stochastic. The post provides a simplistic example of crafting a Void Sceptre to illustrate the complexity of the process. Crafting in PoE can range from simple actions to highly intricate strategies that require careful planning and knowledge of modifier distributions.

The post emphasizes that determining the optimal crafting sequence for a desired item is challenging, as it may not always be straightforward. The optimal sequence could mean the fastest or most cost-efficient way to craft an item, and experienced players often need to research and experiment before finding a successful crafting strategy.

The article delves into the limitations of using game tree search algorithms like Minimax for crafting optimization in PoE due to the game's stochastic environment and single-player nature. Instead, the post suggests exploring model-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms to tackle the problem of finding the optimal crafting sequence for a target item in PoE.

### Prepare for AI Hackers (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2023/02/right-now-ai-hacking) | 37 points | by [joshagilend](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=joshagilend) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40951614)

In 2016, at DEF CON, the world's largest hacker convention, a groundbreaking event took place that hinted at a future dominated by AI hackers. The Cyber Grand Challenge, a hacking competition where artificial intelligence systems autonomously hacked each other, showcased a glimpse of the vulnerability to computer-based hacking on a massive scale.

Bruce Schneier, a computer-security expert, foresees a future where AI hackers could exploit vulnerabilities in financial, political, and social systems with unprecedented speed and sophistication, potentially going unnoticed until it's too late. AI hackers possess the ability to analyze vast amounts of data to find vulnerabilities and devise novel hacks that humans wouldn't consider.

The threat of AI hackers lies in both intentional exploitation instructed by their designers and unintentional hacking where AIs find solutions that were never intended, posing a significant challenge for detection. While the concept of AI hackers may seem like science fiction, the rapid advancement of AI technologies indicates that fully autonomous AI hackers may emerge sooner than expected.

The rapid progress of AI, exemplified by the AI Mayhem's improvement from a competition to being used by the Defense Department, underscores the imminent potential for AI hackers to operate. With existing technology pieces ready to be combined, the dawn of autonomous AI hackers is closer than we might think, as history has shown that AI capabilities can leap forward unexpectedly.
