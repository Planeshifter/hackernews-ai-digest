A recent video titled "George Carlin: I'm Glad I'm Dead" created quite a stir, with many people believing that an AI had generated new material from the legendary comedian who passed away in 2008. However, further investigation suggests that the video was actually a human-written and performed comedy routine using voice- and image-generation tools to create an "AI face." This case raises interesting questions about the public's understanding of AI capabilities and its acceptance of AI models as almost magical, potentially human-replacing technology. The situation with Dudesy's Carlin imitation may turn out to be a case of a human imitating an AI imitating a human, blurring the lines between AI-generated content and human creativity.

The discussion revolves around the recent video featuring what seemed to be an AI-generated imitation of George Carlin. Some users point out that it doesn't sound like Carlin and that it was probably a poorly written comedy sketch. Others mention that they are reminded of another podcast called "Dudesy," which may have used a similar gimmick with an AI-generated script. One user is surprised by the reference and mentions how they were forced to watch a thousand hours of content by X guy, finding similarities but still finding the AI text generation plausible. Another user adds a tangential note, mentioning the signs accompanying AI-generated messages and speculating that the images in the video were likely created by DALL-E, an AI capable of generating images from text.
