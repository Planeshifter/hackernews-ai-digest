### Hidden flaws behind expert-level accuracy of multimodal GPT-4 vision in medicine

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01185-7) | 55 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41104782)

A recent study unveiled intriguing insights about the capabilities of OpenAI’s multimodal Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4 with Vision (GPT-4V) in the medical field. While it has garnered attention for outperforming human physicians in medical inquiries—achieving an impressive 81.6% accuracy compared to the human benchmark of 77.8%—the findings highlight a crucial caveat: GPT-4V often presents flawed rationales that could mislead clinical decision-making, with incorrect reasoning appearing in 35.5% of its correct responses.

The study employed 207 challenging questions from the New England Journal of Medicine's Image Challenge to evaluate GPT-4V’s performance not only on direct question accuracy but also on the reasoning behind its choices across three key areas: image comprehension, knowledge recall, and step-by-step multimodal reasoning. While the AI demonstrated high accuracy and performed well even when human physicians faltered, its flawed rationales raise concerns regarding the model's reliability for real-world medical applications.

The researchers emphasize the need for deeper evaluations of AI rationales prior to its integration into clinical workflows, advocating for a careful examination of why the AI arrives at its conclusions—beyond just the answers it provides. This research serves as a reminder of the complexities involved in harnessing AI in critical fields like medicine, implying that accuracy alone does not suffice without robust, understandable justifications.

In a recent discussion about the study examining the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4V in the medical field, several users on Hacker News expressed a mix of skepticism and optimism regarding the AI's performance. Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Concerns Over Reliability**: Many commenters pointed out that while GPT-4V demonstrated higher accuracy than human physicians, its reliance on flawed reasoning could lead to substantial risks in clinical decision-making. There were notable concerns about how these rationales could mislead practitioners.

2. **Experience vs. Computation**: Several participants emphasized the importance of clinical experience. They argued that human experts bring irreplaceable judgment and context to medical diagnoses that AI lacks, highlighting the potential dangers of over-relying on AI-generated insights.

3. **Real-World Application**: Comments suggested a cautious approach towards integrating AI into medical workflows. Users advocated for comprehensive evaluations that consider not only the AI's answers but also the reasoning behind them before adopting such technologies in practice.

4. **Potential Benefits**: Some users acknowledged the significant benefits AI could provide, especially in handling large volumes of data and assisting medical professionals with diagnostics. However, there was a consensus that such tools should augment rather than replace human expertise.

5. **Need for Further Research**: A recurring theme was the necessity for more studies that explore AI performance in realistic clinical environments, including comparisons with actual patient cases and data from experienced clinicians.

Overall, the discussion reflected a balance of hope for AI advancements in medicine tempered with a healthy skepticism about its current limitations and potential risks, underscoring the complexity of incorporating AI into critical life-or-death scenarios.

### Amazon's Exabyte-Scale Migration from Apache Spark to Ray on Amazon EC2

#### [Submission URL](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/amazons-exabyte-scale-migration-from-apache-spark-to-ray-on-amazon-ec2/) | 29 points | by [nojito](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nojito) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41104288)

In an ambitious shift, Amazon's Business Data Technologies (BDT) team is migrating from Apache Spark to Ray on Amazon EC2 to enhance their business intelligence (BI) capabilities. Faced with the daunting task of managing massive datasets—previously reliant on an enormous Oracle Data Warehouse—this transition aims to diminish both processing time and costs while preserving operational continuity.

The move to Ray, an open-source framework often associated with machine learning rather than big data, comes as BDT grapples with the complexities of managing extensive data streams from Amazon S3. Historically, the team had to navigate significant challenges when merging change-data-capture logs at read time, often leading to performance bottlenecks. To mitigate this, they previously relied on Spark to conduct "copy-on-write" merges, generating read-optimized tables that would ease the strain on their analytics services.

Now, as part of this migration, BDT has contributed their first component, The Flash Compactor, to Ray's DeltaCAT project, aspiring to share these improvements with the broader open-source community. This strategic pivot not only showcases Amazon's ongoing commitment to innovation in data handling but also demonstrates their ability to adapt to meet the demands of their users—effectively transforming how they process and analyze vast quantities of data.

In the Hacker News discussion surrounding Amazon's migration from Apache Spark to Ray, users engaged in a mix of technical insights and reflections on the implications of this transition. 

One commenter expressed skepticism, referencing the project's long duration and Amazon's history of focusing on scalability rather than immediate performance improvements. They highlighted the challenges of managing massive datasets stored as CSVs on S3 and the surprising effectiveness of using Parquet format for large datasets.

Another user discussed Ray's capabilities, noting its support for multiple programming languages and potential performance advantages. They highlighted the importance of low-level control in distributed computing and mentioned that Ray allows for custom optimizations in data processing, which could alleviate some of the problems experienced with Spark.

A user named Narhem pointed out the difficulty of processing larger data volumes and emphasized the necessity of a robust solution that could manage distributed computing efficiently. They discussed how Ray balances efficiency with building customized hardware clusters, indicating that while existing distributed frameworks may perform adequately, there's a significant benefit to leveraging Ray’s capabilities for specific tasks.

Overall, the conversation conveyed a sense of cautious optimism about the shift to Ray, while acknowledging the complexities involved in managing large-scale data operations.
