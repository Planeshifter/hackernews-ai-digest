### Machine conquest: Jules Verne's technocratic worldmaking

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/review-of-international-studies/article/machine-conquest-jules-vernes-technocratic-worldmaking/E5897EB8F3FB9A8F0142075EE38D69BC) | 59 points | by [johntfella](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johntfella) | [61 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41894025)

In a thought-provoking article published in the *Review of International Studies*, researcher Jan Eijking explores the intricate ways in which Jules Verne’s literary work acts as a blueprint for technocratic worldmaking during the 19th century. Titled "Machine Conquest: Jules Verne’s Technocratic Worldmaking," the article highlights how Verne's *Extraordinary Voyages* series conjures a vision of global order that is driven by elite technocrats rather than traditional political entities.

Eijking argues that Verne’s narratives reflect a complex relationship with colonialism, showing how the writer's fictional adventures provided a framework that justified imperial expansion, particularly among contemporary explorers and colonial figures. By examining Verne’s portrayal of fully autonomous technocrats and their often violent methods, the article suggests that he crafted a unique perspective on global governance that resonates even today, particularly in discussions around techno-colonial projects like space colonization.

The analysis not only sheds light on Verne's ambivalent stance toward colonization—balancing romanticism with critique—but also encourages readers to reconsider the role of speculative fiction in shaping international thought and policy. Through this lens, Eijking's work elevates Verne from a mere adventure storyteller to a pivotal figure in the discourse of international relations and technocratic ideology.

In the discussion surrounding Jan Eijking's article on Jules Verne, various commenters engage in a nuanced examination of the themes presented by Eijking. The conversation highlights aspects of Verne's work related to technocracy, imperialism, and global narratives.

- **Jules Verne and Technocratic Ideology**: Commenters emphasize Verne's portrayal of technocrats as pivotal figures in shaping global governance. They discuss how Verne's characters often operate independently of traditional political structures, reflecting a preference for elite, private governance.

- **Colonialism and Adventure**: There is a recognition of the complex relationship between Verne's narratives and colonialism. Some commenters note how Verne's writings can be interpreted as justifying imperial expansion, while others highlight his ambivalent stance, suggesting he critiques colonial practices even as he embodies some aspects of them.

- **Speculative Fiction’s Role**: Commenters agree on the importance of speculative fiction in influencing political and international discourse. Eijking's assertion that Verne’s stories help readers understand modern global issues sparked discussions about the historical implications of narrative in shaping policies.

- **Contemporary Relevance**: The reflections on Verne's work also lead to discussions about contemporary parallels, particularly around topics such as space colonization and the influence of corporate governments on modern political structures.

Overall, the discussion reveals an appreciation for Verne's literary contributions while critiquing the colonial undertones of his narratives, inviting new interpretations that resonate with today's global and technocratic challenges.

### AI engineers claim new algorithm reduces AI power consumption by 95%

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/ai-engineers-build-new-algorithm-for-ai-processing-replace-complex-floating-point-multiplication-with-integer-addition) | 310 points | by [ferriswil](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ferriswil) | [137 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41889414)

In a groundbreaking development for artificial intelligence, engineers at BitEnergy AI have unveiled a new processing method called Linear-Complexity Multiplication (L-Mul). This innovative approach replaces traditional floating-point multiplication with integer addition while achieving comparable accuracy and precision. More importantly, it promises to slash power consumption by up to an astonishing 95%, which could dramatically alleviate the growing energy demands of AI systems.

As AI applications balloon, data centers have faced increasing power constraints, with their combined energy use exceeding that of over a million homes annually. This surge has caused even major companies like Google to compromise on climate goals to meet AI’s insatiable energy cravings. BitEnergy AI’s L-Mul offers a potential solution, enabling advanced AI technologies without compromising environmental sustainability.

However, the transition won't be seamless. Current hardware, such as Nvidia's upcoming Blackwell GPUs, is not optimized for L-Mul, leaving many AI firms in a quandary after investing heavily in existing technologies. If chip manufacturers can develop application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that harness this new algorithm, we might see a significant shift in how AI powers itself—possibly securing a greener future for AI development.

As the discourse around energy efficiency in AI heats up, L-Mul could be the key to balancing technological progress with ecological responsibility, allowing us to "have our AI cake and eat it too."

In response to the introduction of Linear-Complexity Multiplication (L-Mul) from BitEnergy AI, discussions among users on Hacker News touched on several technical aspects and implications of this new processing algorithm. 

1. **Energy Efficiency**: Many comments emphasized the radical reduction in energy consumption that L-Mul could bring to AI processes—claiming potential cuts by up to 95%. This has generated excitement, especially in light of current energy demands from AI technologies.

2. **Implementation Concerns**: Several users expressed skepticism about transitioning to L-Mul, pointing out that current hardware, including Nvidia's upcoming GPUs, may not support it, leading to potential roadblocks for companies heavily invested in existing architectures.

3. **Accuracy and Precision**: There were robust discussions surrounding the accuracy of L-Mul compared to traditional floating-point multiplication. Some commenters were concerned that L-Mul's reliance on integer addition could impact the precision needed in certain calculations, especially when handling complex models.

4. **Technical Challenges**: A few technical experts in the thread shared practical insights into how L-Mul would need extensive validation against standard benchmarks to ensure it can replace floating-point operations without losing performance.

5. **Future of AI Hardware**: The prospects of producing application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) designed for L-Mul were highlighted as a key factor that could either facilitate or hinder the algorithm's acceptance in the broader AI community.

Overall, while there is enthusiastic support for the energy-saving potential of L-Mul, significant skepticism remains regarding implementation feasibility, accuracy in critical calculations, and the readiness of current hardware to adapt to this new method.
