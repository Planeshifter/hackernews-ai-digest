### Lezer: A parsing system for CodeMirror, inspired by Tree-sitter

#### [Submission URL](https://marijnhaverbeke.nl/blog/lezer.html) | 150 points | by [goranmoomin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goranmoomin) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39805591)

Marijn Haverbeke's latest blog post dives into the world of parsing technology, specifically focusing on a new parsing system he developed for CodeMirror, a popular source code editor. Parsing, often seen as a complex and intimidating field, is broken down into a simple and engaging exercise by Marijn. He discusses the challenges of parsing different languages within an editor and the constraints involved in maintaining performance and responsiveness. 

The current parsing system in CodeMirror involves writing tokenizers for each language to categorize pieces of code. Over the years, various attempts have been made to abstract this process, with the introduction of projects like the Common JavaScript Syntax Highlighting Specification and parsing expression grammars. While these systems proved useful, they also had their limitations and challenges, leading Marijn to pursue a new approach.

Marijn embarked on a project to create a more abstract and efficient way to define incremental tokenizers, ultimately leading to a parsing system based on parsing expression grammars. Although this system showed promise and is currently in use, it came with its own set of challenges, particularly in implementing a stateful tokenizer due to backtracking issues. 

Through his detailed exploration, Marijn highlights the evolution of parsing technology in CodeMirror and sheds light on the complexities and trade-offs involved in developing a robust parsing system for source code editors.

- Users discuss Tree-Sitter, WebAssembly bindings, and the pros and cons of certain parsing systems in the context of CodeMirror's development.
- Additional topics include Yaade, a JSON extension language, recovery strategies in projects, and the intricacies of working collaboratively on existing projects.

Overall, the discussion covers a wide range of topics related to parsing technology, CodeMirror improvements, and various projects within the coding community.

### “Emergent” abilities in LLMs actually develop gradually and predictably – study

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-quickly-do-large-language-models-learn-unexpected-skills-20240213/) | 236 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [171 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39811155)

A recent study sheds light on how large language models (LLMs) develop unexpected skills over time. Researchers have discovered that what may appear as sudden breakthroughs in abilities are actually gradual and predictable, depending on how the performance of the models is measured. The study, led by a team from Stanford University, challenges the concept of "emergent" abilities in LLMs, suggesting that these skills do not emerge suddenly but rather evolve steadily as the models scale up. By changing the metrics used to evaluate the models' performance, the researchers found that the development of new abilities follows a more predictable path than previously thought.

As LLMs continue to grow in size and complexity, their effectiveness in tackling diverse tasks has significantly improved. However, the Stanford researchers argue that the perceived sudden jumps in abilities are more a result of how these abilities are measured rather than inherent properties of the models themselves. By reevaluating the way we assess the performance of LLMs, researchers aim to gain a better understanding of how these models acquire new skills and the implications for AI safety and potential risks. This study challenges existing notions of emergence in AI systems and highlights the importance of careful evaluation methods in uncovering the true capabilities of large language models.

The discussion on the submission "How Quickly Do Large Language Models Learn Unexpected Skills?" on Hacker News delves into various aspects related to the study on large language models (LLMs) and their evolution of skills. Some points raised in the comments are:

- One user mentions that by changing the metrics used for evaluation, potentially emergent abilities in LLMs can be found predictably rather than surprisingly. They emphasize the need to revisit the methods for assessing these models.
- Another user draws parallels between human arithmetic errors and LLM capabilities, stating that while humans struggle with certain calculations, LLMs have their limitations in learning logical structures.
- Other comments focus on the challenges LLMs face in representing grammar and performing complex tasks like multi-digit number processing due to limitations in short-term memory and carry operations.
- The discussion also touches upon the differences in how humans and LLMs approach problem-solving, highlighting the need for LLM training to prompt step-by-step learning akin to human thought processes.
- Lastly, there are mentions of how providing external tools or programming languages to LLMs can influence their problem-solving abilities and the complexity of tasks they can accomplish.

Overall, the comments highlight the ongoing exploration of the capabilities and limitations of LLMs, comparing them to human cognitive abilities and pointing out areas where further research and advancements are needed.

### How ML Model Data Poisoning Works in 5 Minutes

#### [Submission URL](https://journal.hexmos.com/training-data-poisoning/?src=hn) | 64 points | by [R41](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=R41) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39807735)

Data poisoning in LLMs, where malicious data is injected into training sets, can wreak havoc on machine learning models, leading to incorrect outcomes and exposing vulnerabilities that may compromise the integrity of the model and downstream applications. Three notable data poisoning attacks are discussed, including the infamous case of Microsoft's chatbot Tay going rogue on Twitter in 2016 and the challenges faced by artists due to image-generation models copying their work.

The incident at Virus Total exemplifies how data poisoning can infiltrate even established platforms, leading to misclassifications and potentially harmful outcomes. The intricate nature of such attacks makes them difficult to detect and rectify, as reverting the effects of poisoning requires a meticulous analysis of historical data and retraining of models, which can be a laborious and challenging task.

The impacts of data poisoning are far-reaching, encompassing degraded performance, biases in outcomes, and the introduction of embedded backdoors for targeted attacks. One insidious form of attack involves backdoors, where triggers inserted into data samples can manipulate model responses, leading to misclassifications or discriminatory outputs.

To combat data poisoning, developers are advised to implement input validation checks, anomaly detection techniques, and limit the disclosure of sensitive technical details to thwart potential attacks. Vigilance and proactive measures are essential to safeguard against the insidious threat of data poisoning in the realm of Large Language Models.
