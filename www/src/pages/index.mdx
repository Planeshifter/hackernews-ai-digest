### Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16141) | 52 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38552186)

A new research paper titled "Brain-Inspired Efficient Pruning: Exploiting Criticality in Spiking Neural Networks" has been submitted to arXiv. The authors, Shuo Chen and his colleagues, discuss the challenges of pruning deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) due to the binary and non-differentiable nature of spike signals. Pruning is an important technique for reducing the computational and storage requirements of SNNs, making them more suitable for deployment on devices with limited resources. However, existing pruning methods for SNNs often require high time overhead to make pruning decisions. 

To address this issue, the authors propose a regeneration mechanism based on criticality, inspired by the critical brain hypothesis in neuroscience. They introduce a low-cost metric for the criticality of pruning structures and rerank the pruned structures based on their criticality. By regenerating the structures with higher criticality, they are able to obtain more efficient pruned networks. The authors evaluate their method using popular deep neural network architectures, VGG-16 and ResNet-19, for both unstructured and structured pruning. Their method achieves higher performance compared to the current state-of-the-art methods with the same time overhead. Furthermore, they achieve comparable performances, and even better results on VGG-16, compared to the state-of-the-art methods with 11.3x and 15.5x acceleration.

The authors also investigate the underlying mechanism of their method and find that it efficiently selects potential structures, learns consistent feature representations, and reduces overfitting during the recovery phase. The paper is categorized under Neural and Evolutionary Computing, Artificial Intelligence, Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, and Machine Learning.

Overall, this research paper presents a novel approach to efficient pruning of Spiking Neural Networks by exploiting criticality, offering promising results compared to existing methods.

The discussion on this submission includes several different points of view. Some users discuss the challenges of training Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) compared to traditional neural networks, emphasizing that SNNs are not differentiable and cannot use backpropagation. However, there is disagreement on this point, with one user arguing that recent work has shown it is possible to compute gradients in SNNs using backpropagation algorithms that involve spike communication. Another user suggests a technique for recording spike events in an SQL database, allowing for efficient queries and determining the contributors to specific output spikes.

There is also discussion about the feasibility of implementing SNNs on hardware and the potential benefits of event-driven architectures. A user mentions that SNN models can be run on simple CPUs but may require specialized hardware for improved performance. Another user highlights the efficiency of event-driven software and its implications for simulating networks.

In response to a comment about the gradient computation in SNNs, another user suggests using differentiable approximations for spike-based learning in order to optimize the weights of the network. They propose a principled version of injecting noise into the network, which can help in classifying patterns with different probabilities.

There is a brief exchange about the scalability of training large SNNs, with one user mentioning that they stopped using a method that involved billions of neurons for training long short-term memory (LLM) SNNs. Another user points out that current hardware may not efficiently support the constraints of SNNs.

Towards the end of the discussion, a user shares their curiosity about improving the functioning of brains, prompting another user to express interest in improved brain models, particularly in relation to memory and communication abilities.

### How to create an AI narrator for your life

#### [Submission URL](https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ai-narrator) | 32 points | by [Charlieholtz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Charlieholtz) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38550486)

In a recent viral video, an AI clone of Sir David Attenborough narrated a man's everyday activities, bringing a touch of whimsy and humor to the mundane. Inspired by this, the video's creator shared how to create your own AI narrator for your life. The process involves using three AI models: a vision model that can "see" through your computer camera and describe what it sees, a language model that generates the script in the style of your chosen narrator, and a text-to-speech model that gives the script a spoken audio output.

To "see" through your camera, you can use the Llava 13B model, which is cheap and fast, or the GPT-4-Vision model, which is smarter but slightly slower and more expensive. These models take images and text prompts as inputs and provide text responses about the image. 
To feed images to the vision model, you can use your computer's webcam. You'll need a script that takes a photo from the webcam every few seconds and saves it to a file. Downsizing the images will make it faster and cheaper for the vision model to process.
For generating the script, you can use a language model like Mistral 7B. You can prompt the model to write a script in the style of your chosen narrator, using the output from the vision model as the description. Limiting the maximum tokens returned will ensure faster response times.
Finally, you'll need a text-to-speech model to give the script a spoken audio output. The aim is to make it sound natural and not robotic. By following these steps, you can create your own AI narrator to add a touch of creativity and entertainment to your daily life.

So, why not embrace the magic of AI and let an AI narrator bring your everyday activities to life in a fun and whimsical way?

The discussion surrounding the submission includes several comments:
- User "krdlssgn" shares a link to a GitHub repository that replicates the style of Sir David Attenborough's narration using OpenAI's models. They provide instructions on how to download the JSON file and import the pipeline using MittaAI.
- User "msingh_5" expresses concern about installing cameras at home, particularly in the kitchen and front door areas, due to privacy issues. They mention that they would rather use reminders for tasks like cooking chicken or bringing shopping bags or an umbrella based on weather updates and calendar events.
- User "crtvnl" criticizes the idea, calling it a shameless and negligent way of promoting a particular company under the guise of a creative project.
- User "Borrible" suggests an alternative to using AI narration, mentioning a service called SupernannAI, which offers a more centralized and flexible voice-over solution. They also jokingly mention the Spanish Inquisition.
- User "dr" expresses enjoyment in running video deep fakes in real-time.

- User "Charlieholtz" humorously agrees with the concept and mentions that it could be a fun way to play with the models.

### DiLoCo: Distributed Low-Communication Training of Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08105) | 42 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38549337)

Researchers Arthur Douillard and his team have developed a distributed optimization algorithm called DiLoCo, which enables the training of language models on islands of devices that are poorly connected. Large language models (LLMs) are a critical component in many machine learning applications, but their training typically requires tightly interconnected accelerators that exchange gradients and other intermediate states at each optimization step. This creates a challenge when building and maintaining a single computing cluster with many accelerators.

In a recent blog post, Corey Quinn discusses AWS's (de)Generative AI blunder and how it has further fueled the perception that AWS is lagging behind in the Generative AI space. At the recent re:Invent 2023 event, AWS made 22 GenAI-related announcements, but half of them are still in preview. This indicates that many of these announcements were rushed and developed hastily since the release of ChatGPT a year ago. Quinn argues that this obsession with GenAI has distracted AWS from addressing more pressing customer challenges. One particular aspect of AWS's GenAI extravaganza that Quinn highlights is the introduction of Amazon Q, a catchall brand that encompasses coding assistance, chatbots, and natural language processing interfaces. However, the implementation of Amazon Q has been problematic. The chatbot, which shows up on every AWS page load, often provides false information and displays poor knowledge of AWS services. Quinn even points out instances where Amazon Q gave incorrect recommendations regarding AWS instance choices. Despite these flaws, AWS has given Amazon Q prominent placement and promotion. Other users have also reported receiving incorrect answers from Amazon Q on various topics. Overall, Quinn believes that AWS's rush to GenAI has resulted in a violation of its own leadership principles and a failure to meet customer expectations. On the positive side, given Amazon Q's presence and positioning, it may be seen as an official statement on behalf of AWS, which is an upgrade over Amazon's own public relations. Ultimately, ChatGPT still remains the dominant force in the Generative AI space.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of the topic. 

- "urbandw311er" agrees with the points made in the article and suggests that AWS's rush to release previews without proper quality checks is concerning.
