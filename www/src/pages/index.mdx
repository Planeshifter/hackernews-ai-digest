### A* Search Without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04518) | 33 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38395959)

Researchers Forest Agostinelli, Alexander Shmakov, Stephen McAleer, Roy Fox, and Pierre Baldi have introduced a new search algorithm called Q* search, which uses deep Q-networks to efficiently solve problems with large action spaces. The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the sum of the transition costs and heuristic values of a node's children can be computed with a single forward pass through a deep Q-network, eliminating the need to generate those children explicitly. This significantly reduces computation time and requires only one node to be generated per iteration. The researchers applied Q* search to solve the Rubik's Cube with a large action space and found that it incurred only a 4-fold increase in computation time and a 3-fold increase in the number of nodes generated compared to A* search. Additionally, Q* search was up to 129 times faster and generated up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A* search. The researchers also proved that Q* search is guaranteed to find a shortest path with an admissible heuristic function. The paper, titled "A* Search Without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks," provides further details on their findings.
