### Stanisław Lem's vision of artificial life

#### [Submission URL](https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/stanislaw-lems-prescient-vision-of-artificial-life/) | 441 points | by [axiomdata316](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=axiomdata316) | [152 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38475545)

Stanisław Lem's novel "The Invincible" is a prescient vision of artificial life that still resonates today. In the story, a space cruiser is sent to investigate the disappearance of a sister spaceship on the planet Regis III. What they discover is a form of life that has evolved from self-replicating machines, possibly the survivors of a robot war. The crew is faced with the quandary of what to do when faced with the unknown. Published in 1964, the book predicted the concept of artificial life before it became a scientific field. Lem explores the idea of whether evolutionary programs and devices can be considered alive or if they simply simulate life. The novel presents a hybrid view of artificial life, where automata on Regis III evolve through a struggle with indigenous life forms and among different types of automata. Lem imagines a world where solar-powered artificial organisms, driven by swarm intelligence, become the dominant force. This vision aligns with contemporary research that shows swarms of artificial beings can exhibit complex behaviors with simple rules. Lem's novel challenges our understanding of life and our place in the universe.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.techdirt.com/2023/11/29/lets-not-flip-sides-on-ip-maximalism-because-of-ai/) | 95 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [108 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38472367)

In a recent article on Techdirt, author Matthew Lane discusses the importance of fair use in copyright law and its implications for AI companies. Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission, primarily for purposes such as commentary, criticism, and parody. Lane highlights how fair use has filled an important gap in social media and art, allowing us to retweet or link content without fear of copyright infringement. Moreover, many creators who make a living from streaming video games or creating "react" content rely on fair use protection. However, Lane expresses concern over public interest advocates who are willing to sacrifice fair use in order to regulate AI companies. He argues that using copyright in this way would be both unnecessary and detrimental, as it would hinder the ability of AI to analyze content and potentially lead to the exploitation of artists. Lane suggests that addressing the issues surrounding AI, such as worker exploitation, requires thoughtful policy-making rather than using copyright as a blunt instrument. He draws parallels to the fights against "on a computer" software patents, which caused problems in the past and still persist today. Lane concludes by emphasizing the need to preserve fair use and prevent its erosion in the face of new technological advancements.
