#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03854-1) | 38 points | by [birriel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birriel) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38520757)

IBM has announced the development of the first quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits â€“ the quantum equivalent of digital bits in a classical computer. However, instead of continuing to increase the number of qubits in its machines, IBM will now focus on improving error resistance. Quantum states are notoriously prone to errors, and IBM plans to address this issue by using error-correction techniques that would require fewer physical qubits. The company aims to build chips designed to hold a few error-corrected qubits in about 400 physical qubits and network them together. This approach could reduce the number of physical qubits needed for useful computations by a factor of 10 or more. IBM's road map for its quantum research envisions achieving useful computations within the next decade.

The discussion on this submission primarily revolves around the topic of logical qubits and error-correction techniques in quantum computing. One user, vlovich123, points out that the reported numbers of qubits in quantum computers may refer to logical qubits rather than physical qubits. They mention that research generally indicates that error-correction techniques require around 1000 physical qubits for each logical qubit, and express excitement about an alternative error-correction scheme called quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) that could reduce this ratio by a factor of 10.

Another user, d-bcn, argues that 10 logical qubits defined on just one physical qubit is a reasonable definition of a logical qubit and highlights Google's work on quantum error correction. They discuss experiments that demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum error correction using 13 physical qubits and note that other groups have also achieved small-scale logical qubits with improved performance.

In response to vlovich123's earlier comment, d-bcn mentions that they have likely managed to create a logical qubit, pointing to experimental evidence from Egan and Google. They provide links to two experiments that showed small improvements in logical performance, although the improvements were relatively small in scale.

In conclusion, the discussion involves a technical debate about the definition and implementation of logical qubits, as well as the advancements and challenges in error-correction techniques for quantum computing.

### Run 70B LLM Inference on a Single 4GB GPU with This New Technique

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.gopubby.com/unbelievable-run-70b-llm-inference-on-a-single-4gb-gpu-with-this-new-technique-93e2057c7eeb?gi=cbe7920f4cd2) | 108 points | by [gardenfelder](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gardenfelder) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38508571)

Have you ever wondered if it's possible to run inference on a single GPU with a large language model? Well, Gavin Li has come up with a new technique that allows you to do just that. In a recent article, he explains the key techniques for extreme memory optimization of large models. The most critical technique is layer-wise inference. By leveraging the divide and conquer approach, Li shows that you don't actually need to keep all layers in GPU memory. Instead, you can load whichever layer is needed from disk when executing that layer, do all the calculations, and then free up the memory. This significantly reduces the GPU memory required per layer.

Li also introduces flash attention, which is a critical optimization for large language models. Flash attention deeply optimizes CUDA memory access to achieve multi-fold speedups for inference and training. This optimization reduces the memory complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n), making it much more efficient. To further optimize the memory usage, Li discusses model file sharding. The original model file is typically sharded into multiple chunks, but loading the entire file for each layer execution wastes a lot of memory and disk reading time. By pre-processing the model file and sharding it by layers, the memory usage is minimized. To implement these techniques, Li utilizes the meta device feature provided by HuggingFace Accelerate. The meta device is a virtual device designed for running ultra large models. It allows you to dynamically transfer parts of the model from the meta device to a real device like the CPU or GPU during execution, reducing memory usage. If you're interested in trying out these optimizations for yourself, Li has open-sourced the code in a library called AirLLM. The library, which can be found on the Anima GitHub, allows you to achieve extreme memory optimization with just a few lines of code.

So there you have it, with these techniques and the AirLLM library, you can run inference on a single 4GB GPU with a 70B large language model. It's truly unbelievable!

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of running inference on a single GPU with a large language model. Here are some key points from the comments:

- One commenter mentions that they tried running the techniques on a GTX 1060 6GB GPU but found it to be slow, taking 13 hours to generate a sentence. They speculate that the GPU memory usage might be the bottleneck.
- Another commenter discusses the technique of model file sharding and suggests looking into PyTorch's gradient checkpointing for efficient memory usage.
- A discussion arises regarding the difference in performance between CPU and GPU inference. Some commenters mention that CPU inference is typically limited by memory bandwidth, whereas GPU inference benefits from loading weights onto the GPU. SSD loading of weights is also mentioned as a way to reduce GPU memory usage.
- There is some skepticism raised regarding the capabilities of non-batched inference for large language models. Commenters mention that certain context and historical understanding provided by complete sentences might be necessary for relevant embeddings and projections in custom matrix operations.
- The potential drawbacks of extreme memory optimization are also discussed, with one commenter pointing out that the process seems to swap VRAM to RAM and disk, which can significantly impact performance.
- Various optimization techniques and resources are shared, including libraries such as AirLLM and llmcpp, as well as discussions on quantizing models and using DirectStorage for improved IO.
- Further discussions revolve around distributed computing and the benefits of using multiple GPUs to process different layers simultaneously, though latency is a concern in such setups.

Overall, the discussion explores different techniques, optimizations, and limitations related to running inference on a single GPU with a large language model.

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/12/unsupervised-speech-to-speech.html) | 20 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38497549)

Google Research has introduced Translatotron 3, an unsupervised speech-to-speech translation architecture that can learn the translation task from monolingual data alone. Traditional speech-to-speech translation models rely on parallel speech data, which is scarce, leading to the need for synthesized data. However, Translatotron 3 eliminates the requirement for bilingual speech datasets by incorporating techniques such as back-translation, pre-training with SpecAugment, and unsupervised embedding mapping based on Multilingual Unsupervised Embeddings (MUSE). Experimental results between Spanish and English show that Translatotron 3 outperforms a baseline cascade system. By preserving paralinguistic characteristics, such as tone and emotion, Translatotron 3 aims to improve the quality and authenticity of translated speech.

The discussion revolves around the Translatotron 3 submission on Hacker News. One user, "xnx," comments on the challenges of translating languages and mentions that it often stretches the mind. Another user, "grsv," responds, stating that it is humans' sentience and comprehension that allows them to learn languages, and the proposed method relies on training models with monolingual speech-text datasets. "grsv" further explains that the proposed method utilizes a shared embedding space for languages, forcing the model to learn semantics independently of the language. Additionally, they mention using back-translation for training and conducting performance checks using a Spanish-English-Spanish translation loop. They express enthusiasm for the promising and interesting results, wondering how similar the languages need to be at a lexical level for the model's performance to excel. Another user, "IanCal," shares their curiosity about the level of complexity in English and internal linguistic representation, and suggests that if there is a low complexity in mapping internal representations, then a sensible sentence in English should result in a sensible sentence in the translated language.

Overall, the discussion focuses on the methodology and potential implications of Translatotron 3, with users expressing interest in the results and exploring the nuances of language translation.

### Galactic algorithm

#### [Submission URL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galactic_algorithm) | 115 points | by [sockaddr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sockaddr) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38500782)

In computer science, there is a concept called a galactic algorithm. These are algorithms that have incredible theoretical performance but are never actually used in practice. There are a few reasons for this. Sometimes the performance gains only apply to problems that are so large they never occur in real-world scenarios. Other times, the complexity of the algorithm outweighs the relatively small gain in performance. These algorithms are named "galactic" because they will never be used on any data sets here on Earth.

Even though galactic algorithms are not used in practice, they can still contribute to computer science in a few ways. Firstly, they may introduce new techniques that can eventually be used to create practical algorithms. Secondly, as computational power advances, previously impractical algorithms may become feasible to use. Thirdly, even if an algorithm is impractical, it can still demonstrate that certain bounds can be achieved or prove that proposed bounds are incorrect, thereby advancing the theory of algorithms.

For example, there are galactic algorithms for problems like integer multiplication, matrix multiplication, communication channel capacity, sub-graph testing, cryptographic breaks, and the traveling salesman problem. These algorithms have impressive theoretical performance, but their large constants make them impractical for real-world use. However, they still serve important purposes. For instance, they can inspire further research and refinement to make them more practical or they can settle important open problems in computer science, like the P versus NP problem.

So, while galactic algorithms may never be used in practice, they still have value in advancing the field of computer science and pushing the boundaries of what is possible.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to galactic algorithms. One commenter shares a link to a paper that discusses a simulated annealing algorithm for solving global optimization problems. Another commenter expresses doubt about the practicality of these algorithms, suggesting that simulated annealing and random restarts may not be effective. Another user finds the topic interesting and mentions that numbers can be fascinating. 

One commenter asks if the concept of galactic algorithms can be applied to other fields. Another user shares a link to Optimal Universal Search, which is related to the topic of optimal algorithms. 

There is also a discussion about the classification of General Relativity as a galactic algorithm for solving Newtonian Equations. A user argues that General Relativity is not a true galactic algorithm because it provides similar answers when calculating the motion of spacecraft around a black hole. However, another user argues that the comparison is not accurate and that the complexity and practicality of General Relativity differ from galactic algorithms.

The discussion ends with a user mentioning that General Relativity is used in GPS to correct clock discrepancies based on its small correction below a galactic scale.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tu-darmstadt.de/universitaet/aktuelles_meldungen/einzelansicht_410816.en.jsp) | 51 points | by [FinnKuhn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FinnKuhn) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38494466)

Scientists at the Technische UniversitÃ¤t Darmstadt in Germany have developed a technique using the optical Talbot effect to increase the number of qubits in a quantum computer without requiring additional resources. Qubits are the basic units of information in quantum computing and can process both "0" and "1" simultaneously, allowing for parallel calculations. Currently, quantum computers are limited to a few hundred qubits, but for practical applications, such as optimizing traffic flows, thousands or millions of qubits are needed. The Darmstadt team's approach uses laser beams and a glass element with microlenses arranged like a chessboard to create a 3D lattice of focal points that can hold individual atoms as qubits. By exploiting the Talbot effect, multiple layers of qubits can be added without needing additional laser output. The researchers were able to create 16 layers of qubits, potentially allowing for over 10,000 qubits. The team plans to further develop the technology for applications in quantum technologies and high-precision optical atomic clocks.
