### AI models collapse when trained on recursively generated data

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y) | 248 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [175 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41058194)

A recent study delves into an intriguing phenomenon called "model collapse," affecting generative AI models like GPT when they are trained on data generated by their predecessors. As we enter an era where large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate online content, researchers warn that using this model-generated text indiscriminately can lead to irreversible defects in subsequent AI models. 

The study highlights a degenerative process whereby future models, trained on polluted datasets mostly consisting of prior AI outputs, begin to lose touch with genuine human-generated content. This degeneration occurs in two phases: initially, these models start to forget details about the "tails" of data distributions, leading to a simplified and less varied understanding of text. Over time, this can culminate in a severe divergence from the original data, significantly impairing the output quality.

The implications are substantial; it suggests that as LLMs disseminate content more widely, the importance of preserving original, human-generated data becomes crucial. Researchers point out that without this genuine source, the future quality of AI-generated content may decline dramatically, reducing the effectiveness of these models in understanding and producing complex, high-quality human language. Thus, as AI technologies evolve, preserving authentic human interactions could be key to maintaining the richness and accuracy of generative models in the digital age.
