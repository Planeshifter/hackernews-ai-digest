### How to Build Your Own AI-Generated Images with ControlNet and Stable Diffusion

#### [Submission URL](https://www.datature.io/blog/how-to-build-your-own-ai-generated-image-with-controlnet-and-stable-diffusion) | 172 points | by [gkeechin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gkeechin) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37993202)

Generative AI, a type of artificial intelligence that can generate new content without explicit programming, has gained recognition for its ability to create original images, music, text, and even video. By using machine learning algorithms to analyze and learn from large datasets, generative AI models can produce content that closely resembles the training data but is not identical.

The usefulness of generative AI lies in its potential to automate processes, improve content quality and diversity, and offer new insights and predictions. It can be applied in various ways, such as creating original content for advertising, marketing, and entertainment, generating new data samples to enhance machine learning, simulating environments for testing technologies like autonomous vehicles, personalizing content based on user preferences, and providing predictive analysis based on extensive datasets.

When it comes to generating images, generative AI models excel at producing diverse variations with a clear foreground object and a contextualized background. These models can seamlessly replace objects or backgrounds, change graphic styles, or create similar variations, enabling users to create impressive art, high-quality product advertisements, and even augment computer vision datasets.

Several methods are employed in generative AI. One popular technique is Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which use a pair of neural networks—an image generator and an image discriminator—to produce new content. The generator creates samples while the discriminator evaluates their similarity to the training data. Through adversarial training, the generator aims to deceive the discriminator, resulting in the creation of new samples that closely resemble the original data.

Another method is Stable Diffusion, which gradually generates an image from a noise signal by passing it through a series of increasingly complex convolutional neural networks. This process refines the image until the final output—an image resembling the training data—is achieved. Stable Diffusion addresses the challenges faced by other generative AI techniques, such as GANs, offering stability and the ability to produce high-quality, diverse, and realistic images.

In an interesting application example, generative AI can be used to augment backgrounds for single objects, benefiting object identification and product placement. By combining object transform and color augmentations, background in-painting, and object in-painting, users can generate pristine images with varying environments and smooth transitions between the foreground and background.

Generative AI offers immense potential for content creation, data augmentation, simulation, personalization, and predictive analysis. As the field continues to advance, we can expect even more impressive applications of generative AI in numerous industries.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the topic of generative AI, specifically Stable Diffusion and ControlNet models. Some users discuss the benefits and limitations of using these models for content generation. One user mentions their experience using DALL-E and generating thousands of images with it. Another user shares examples of images generated using SDXL (Stable Diffusion).

There is also a discussion about the learning curve and time required to achieve good results with generative AI models. Some users suggest tweaking prompts and experimenting with different approaches to improve the quality of generated content. The topic of customization and control over the generated content is also mentioned, with users discussing the advantages and limitations of different models.

Some users recommend specific tools and resources for working with generative AI models, such as ComfyUI for ControlNet and SDXL for Stable Diffusion. There is also a mention of other AI models like ChatGPT and RealVis XL.

### How does macOS manage virtual cores on Apple Silicon?

#### [Submission URL](https://eclecticlight.co/2023/10/23/how-does-macos-manage-virtual-cores-on-apple-silicon/) | 227 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37991295)

Apple's new Sonoma chip, which is used in their M-series processors, includes two types of CPU cores: Efficiency (E) cores and Performance (P) cores. The E cores are energy-efficient but slower, while the P cores provide higher performance. The allocation of threads to these cores is determined by the Quality of Service (QoS) of the apps running on macOS. However, with the introduction of Game Mode in Sonoma, CPU scheduling can be adjusted to reserve E cores specifically for gaming.

This article explores how Sonoma handles CPU core allocation when running macOS virtual machines (VMs) with a set number of virtual cores. The M-series chips have different configurations of E and P cores depending on the model, with Pro and Max models having more cores than base models. The allocation of threads to cores depends on their QoS and the clustering of the cores.

In the case of VMs, all virtual CPU cores are equivalent to P cores, and there is no option to allocate threads to E cores on the host machine. This is demonstrated in tests performed on a Mac Studio M1 Max running Sonoma 14.0, where VMs with different numbers of virtual cores were used. The tests showed that the core allocation in the VMs mirrored the core clustering on the host machine's P cores.

Overall, the article provides insights into how Sonoma handles CPU core allocation for different workloads, highlighting the importance of QoS, clustering, and core types in determining thread scheduling and performance.
