### Invalid SMILES beneficial rather than detrimental to chemical language models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42256-024-00821-x) | 6 points | by [Bluestein](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bluestein) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40980639)

The latest research in the field of generative machine learning models reveals a surprising discovery - the ability to produce invalid outputs is actually beneficial to chemical language models. Contrary to popular belief, the generation of invalid SMILES strings serves as a self-corrective mechanism that filters out low-likelihood samples, ultimately improving the model's performance. Enforcing valid outputs, on the other hand, can lead to structural biases in the generated molecules, hindering distribution learning and limiting generalization to new chemical spaces.

This new perspective challenges the prevailing assumption that invalid outputs are a flaw in chemical language models and instead presents them as a feature that enhances model functionality. By embracing the presence of invalid outputs, these models are better equipped to explore the vast and complex landscape of chemical space, potentially leading to the discovery of novel molecules with unique properties.

The study highlights the importance of understanding the nuances of model outputs and sheds light on how embracing imperfections can actually improve overall performance in the realm of chemical language models.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission focuses on the idea that allowing the generation of invalid outputs in chemical language models may actually benefit the model's performance. Users Grimblewald and Bluestein engage in a conversation about the importance of including unlikely or conditional instances in the model's output. Grimblewald argues that removing extremely unlikely instances would prevent the model from capturing extreme rare instances, leading to a limited distribution learning capability. Bluestein agrees with Grimblewald, emphasizing that considering unlikely conditions can lead to interesting results and enhance model performance. Overall, the discussion underlines the significance of accounting for imperfections and unlikely scenarios in chemical language models to achieve better outcomes.

This innovative toolkit is designed to be fully compatible with NVIDIA CUDA, making it easy for users to leverage their existing codebase for AMD GPUs.

Some key features of SCALE include accepting CUDA programs as-is, no need for porting to another language, and impersonating an installation of the NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit to ensure existing build tools and scripts work seamlessly. The toolkit has been tested with various open-source CUDA projects like NVIDIA Thrust, Blender Cycles, and xgboost, showcasing its capabilities.

In terms of GPU support, SCALE currently covers AMD gfx1030 and gfx1100, with plans to expand support to other AMD GPU architectures in the future. The toolkit comprises components like an nvcc-compatible compiler, implementations of the CUDA runtime and driver APIs for AMD GPUs, and open-source wrapper libraries for handling CUDA-X APIs.

SCALE's goal is to eliminate the need for maintaining multiple codebases or sacrificing performance to support different GPU vendors. It offers opt-in language extensions to enhance the efficiency of GPU code, providing users with a seamless transition from nvcc to SCALE.

For those interested in learning more or trying out SCALE, there are resources available such as tutorials, examples, and ways to get in touch with the team through Discord or email at [email protected] This toolkit is continuously evolving, with plans to incorporate more features and support for additional GPU architectures in the future.
