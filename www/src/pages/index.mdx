### Stylized image binning algorithm, for the web

#### [Submission URL](https://benjdd.com/posts/stylized-image-binning-algorithm/) | 38 points | by [bddicken](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bddicken) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39651677)

A new stylized image binning algorithm has been unleashed, merging photography, programming, the web, and coffee into a creative blend. This innovative tool uses a binning algorithm to transform images into pixel art masterpieces, all powered by Javascript and the <canvas> element. By adjusting the parameters binSize and binGap, users can control the size and spacing of the bins, ultimately creating a unique and stylized pixelated effect. The magic begins by dividing the input image into bins based on the chosen binSize. Smaller bins result in higher resolution but fewer brightness values for manipulation. The binGap parameter determines the spacing between each bin, adding a stylistic touch to the final product. Each bin is filled with a black square sized according to the average brightness of its pixels, creating a visually appealing pixelated look.

To bring this algorithm to life on the web, Javascript and <canvas> element are the weapons of choice. Despite the limitations of web-based image processing, the magic of pixel manipulation is made possible by extracting and modifying the RGB pixel data array from the canvas. Slide through the original and stylized versions with an interactive slider, thanks to the img-comparison-slider tool by Dimah Snisarenko.

The process is rounded off by setting up sliders, image loading functionalities, and custom Javascript functions to load images onto the canvases. The binning algorithm works its charm by retrieving pixel data, calculating bin sizes, and drawing black rectangles within each bin to forge the pixelated art style. Let your creativity flow by adjusting the parameters and uploading your images to experience the magic of this stylized image binning algorithm!
