### Stable Diffusion and ControlNet: “Hidden” Text (see thumbnail vs. full image)

#### [Submission URL](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1561k15/free_tool_to_generate_hidden_text_using_stable/) | 98 points | by [b0ner_t0ner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=b0ner_t0ner) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36832271)

BoostPixels, a Reddit user, has created a fascinating tool that uses Stable Diffusion and ControlNet to generate hidden text in images. The tool works in a unique way – when the image is small, the text stands out clearly. However, as the image enlarges, decoding the text becomes a challenging task. This curious phenomena has captured the attention of many users who have tried to decipher the hidden messages. Some strategies, such as squinting, blinking rapidly, or scrolling the image, seem to help make the text more visible. While it's an interesting experiment, /u/BoostPixels hopes that this tool won't be used for evil purposes.

The discussion on the submission starts with GaggiX acknowledging the use of the ControlNet model by the OP, BoostPixels. They share a link to an installation guide for the ControlNet model and mention that previous methods of generating QR codes didn't produce high-quality messages. There is then a conversation about AI generating QR codes and patterns similar to natural ones, with LanternLight83 wondering if complex text content can be sorted by the complexity of the ControlNet Local Linear Models (LLMs).
 
ben_w points out that generating text visually is difficult for short words with no distinctive landmarks, but GaggiX argues that ASCII art limits the expressiveness of sentences. cpblwb offers a poetic interpretation of the hidden text. gdlsk joins the discussion, expressing praise for the comments on Reddit and acknowledging the community's collective understanding of the tool's implementation.

The conversation then delves into the different user experiences when viewing the hidden text. Some discuss how the text becomes more visible when zoomed or viewed on a mobile phone, while others mention difficulties in spotting the text unless they hold their phone at a specific angle. There is also discussion about the visibility of the text on different screens, with some users mentioning that enlarging the image on a high-resolution monitor makes the text disappear while others find it readable. 

The link in the submission is mentioned by ch, who confirms that the stable diffusion method works on a MacBook Pro M1 Max. tmm shares a similar illusion they made in 2014 that involves thumbnail squinting. strng comments on the exploitability of resizing algorithms, mentioning that Photoshop filters can produce misleading results. tlstptml and hpfnsprgrj offer explanations related to human contrast sensitivity and letter squinting, respectively.

### Decoding the ACL Paper: Gzip and KNN Rival Bert in Text Classification

#### [Submission URL](https://codeconfessions.substack.com/p/decoding-the-acl-paper-gzip-and-knn) | 30 points | by [abhi9u](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=abhi9u) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36806577)

A recent paper presented at the ACL conference for natural language processing (NLP) has gained attention for its innovative approach to text classification. The paper shows that combining the use of gzip and K-nearest neighbour (KNN) can achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art models like BERT. This is a refreshing perspective at a time when most research focuses on large language models. The paper's findings are explained in layman's terms in this article, with a follow-up article planned to delve deeper into the approach and its implications for NLP research. The traditional approaches to text classification, such as linear regression or neural networks, often require training on large datasets and can be computationally expensive. In contrast, the gzip and KNN approach offers a simpler and more cost-effective solution. The key steps involve compressing the input text using gzip, computing the Normalized Compression Distance (NCD) between the compressed texts, and then finding the k-nearest neighbors based on these distances. The majority class of the neighbors is then chosen as the target label. The NCD measures the amount of shared information between two texts, and if they have similar content, their concatenation will achieve higher compression. This approach leverages compression algorithms and information theory to achieve accurate text classification without the need for massive language models.

The discussion around the submission primarily revolves around the potential of the gzip and KNN approach for text classification. One user points out that the technique may overestimate performance relative to BERT, and recommends evaluating its accuracy against expected KNN compressed data. Another user suggests that the paper has the potential to start an interesting discussion on finding synonymous word classes, to which another user responds that such an approach could work using semantic modeling and embeddings. The second user also mentions that they are writing an article to explain how gzip can be helpful in text classification. One user jokingly adds that the approach wouldn't find synonyms that are closer to random strings.

More than 9,000 authors have signed an open letter calling out tech companies behind generative AI for exploiting copyright-protected works without consent, credit, or compensation. The authors argue that these companies are using their writings to train chatbots, such as GPT-4 and ChatGPT, to summarize and imitate their works. The open letter specifically calls out tech giants like OpenAI, Alphabet, Meta, IBM, and Microsoft, urging them to obtain permission and fairly compensate authors for the use of their works in generative AI programs and outputs. The Authors Guild highlights the threat that generative AI poses to writers' professions, as it floods the market with machine-written content and contributes to a decline in authors' income. This comes shortly after bestselling authors Mona Awad and Paul Tremblay filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, claiming that ChatGPT was trained using portions of their novels without their consent. Both the open letter and the lawsuit shed light on the ethical and legal questions surrounding the use of copyrighted material in AI technology.

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of copyright law, fair use, and the impact of generative AI on the distribution of content.  One commenter raises the point that purchasing a book does not necessarily grant the purchaser the right to modify or use the content in AI systems. They argue that there is a distinction between creating a parody or satire, which may be protected as fair use, and using copyrighted works without permission in generative AI. Another commenter questions whether embedding AI crops into AI systems through modification would qualify as fair use. They further discuss the complexity of copyright claims and the applicability of fair use factors in determining the legality of using copyrighted works. A reply to this comment emphasizes the importance of the four factors considered in fair use cases: the purpose and character of the use, the nature of the copyrighted work, the amount and substantiality of the portion used, and the effect on the potential market for the copyrighted work. They also mention that the commercial nature of the AI applications and the potential harm to the market for original works could be significant factors to consider. In response to a comparison made between modifying the Mona Lisa and using AI-generated crops, another commenter mentions a recent Supreme Court decision involving Warhol and Goldsmith. They note that the decision clarified the high level of commerciality necessary to define copying as illegal for derivative works. The discussion then delves into the proprietary nature of AI algorithms and the commercial rush to capitalize on generative AI. The commenter suggests that the AI community is protecting their proprietary interests and refusing to engage with AI regulation. One commenter expresses skepticism about prevailing legal arguments in the court proceedings and hopes that people will learn to synthesize new content based on existing works.

Now, this application puts users in the shoes of these skilled operators, allowing them to create vowel formants by pressing specific button combinations. While the results may not sound exactly like the original video, due to subtle articulations and dynamics, it provides a unique glimpse into the past.

### Generative AI space and the mental imagery of alien minds

#### [Submission URL](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/07/generative-ai-space-and-the-mental-imagery-of-alien-minds/) | 244 points | by [RafelMri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RafelMri) | [106 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36767837)

In a recent post on his blog, Stephen Wolfram explores the concept of alien minds and how artificial intelligence (AI) can help us understand them. Wolfram explains that AIs are essentially accessible forms of alien minds because they are not aligned with human thought processes. To capture the "mental imagery" of an alien AI, Wolfram suggests modifying a generative AI by resetting weights in its neural net. This "alien" neural net still produces images, but they become increasingly different from human perception as the neural net is modified. By studying these progressively alien images, Wolfram believes that we can gain insight into the worlds of different and alien minds. Additionally, Wolfram explains how AIs are trained to generate images by capturing the regularities found in billions of images from the web. These "random images" exhibit the statistical patterns of the training data and can show recognizable objects or scenes. Overall, Wolfram's exploration of alien minds and generative AI provides a fascinating perspective on perception and cognition.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the concept of AI-generated images and how they relate to human perception. Some comments touch on the similarities and differences between AI dream-like images and human dreams.

### A Theory on Adam Instability in Large-Scale Machine Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09871) | 135 points | by [vov_or](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vov_or) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36771484)

A new theory has emerged in the field of machine learning that explains the previously unexplained divergent behavior observed in the training of large language models. The theory suggests that the phenomenon is due to the optimization algorithm used for training, called Adam. The researchers argue that Adam can reach a state where the parameter update vector has a large norm and is uncorrelated with the direction of descent on the training loss landscape, leading to divergence. This behavior is more likely to occur in the training of deep models with large batch sizes, which is common in large-scale language model training. The theory is supported by observations from training runs of language models with varying scales. The paper, titled "A Theory on Adam Instability in Large-Scale Machine Learning," is authored by Igor Molybog and 16 other researchers. It is available for download on arXiv.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the new theory proposed by the researchers regarding the divergence in training large language models due to the use of the Adam optimization algorithm. Some users suggest trying different techniques such as controlling the term of the gradient or restarting the training process to mitigate the issue. Others discuss the potential of using CMA-ES (Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy) and other optimization methods for better results. There are also discussions on the limitations of gradient-based optimization methods and the challenges faced in finding global minima. Some users mention the possibility of using swarm optimization and genetic algorithms to improve the search process. One user points out the importance of local minima and the difference between biological neural networks and machine learning models.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09960) | 14 points | by [rileyphone](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rileyphone) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36776920)

The paper titled "A Latent Space Theory for Emergent Abilities in Large Language Models" by Hui Jiang explores the relationship between languages and their underlying meanings. The study categorizes languages as unambiguous or epsilon-ambiguous and demonstrates that large language models (LLMs) can exhibit emergent abilities, such as language understanding, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and effective instruction fine-tuning, through Bayesian inference on the sparse joint distribution of languages. This paper presents quantitative results and sheds light on the capabilities of LLMs in language processing.

The discussion around the submission focuses on the structure and analysis of languages. One user argues that languages are created randomly for specific purposes and convey information through distinct and independent units such as sentences or programming languages. Another user adds that language messages represent intended meanings in a space, where different intentions constitute distinct regions and simple intentions are represented by elements in a finite set. They suggest that the study of language should consider discrete countable assumptions.  In response, another user provides research that supports the effectiveness of transformer-based language models. They share two articles that discuss the reasonable effectiveness of these models.  However, one user disagrees with the assumption that language messages contain intentions recursively in a fundamental space of meaning. They argue that this approach to studying language is oversimplified and may not fully capture the complexity of the field.  Finally, a user points out that the discussion seems to lack an interdisciplinary perspective and suggests that siloing of perspectives may prevent a comprehensive understanding of the topic.

An AI-powered policing tool has come under scrutiny after it identified a gray Chevrolet as a possible criminal vehicle in a drug trafficking case in New York. The AI analyzed the driving patterns of the car using a database of 1.6 billion license plate records and determined that it was following routes known to be used by drug traffickers. The car was subsequently pulled over and a search led to the discovery of crack cocaine, a pistol, and a large amount of cash. The case highlights the potential constitutional issues that come with AI-powered policing, as there was no judicial oversight in this instance. The AI tool used in the case was developed by Rekor, which has sold its automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) technology to numerous police departments across the US. Privacy advocates are concerned about the scale of surveillance and the lack of oversight in these systems.

- User "tmrd" argues that the AI system operates on the assumption that certain locations are visited by criminals, which they claim is unfair.

- User "spprtngnr" mentions that the AI system is designed to support law enforcement and that any potential flaws should be addressed through improvements in the technology.

### Ziplm: Gzip-Backed Language Model

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Futrell/ziplm) | 235 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36732430)

Introducing ziplm - a useless but mildly interesting language model using compressors built into Python. This model is based on the fact that there is an equivalence between probability distributions and codes. By converting code lengths to probabilities, ziplm generates text based on the compressed lengths of the input data. Although it doesn't produce perfect results, it is capable of generating somewhat recognizable text.

### Ada Outperforms Assembly: A Case Study

#### [Submission URL](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~adagroup/sigada-website/lawlis.html) | 54 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36741990)

In a case study from 1992, a defense contractor attempted to prove that Ada programming language could not produce real-time code by writing a portion of their software in Ada. The expectation was that the resulting machine code would be too large and too slow for a communications application. However, the opposite was found to be true. The compiled Ada code was smaller and executed at approximately the same speed, if not faster, than the corresponding assembly code. This challenged the belief that assembly language was the only appropriate language for certain applications. The contractor had initially disregarded the use of Ada, despite it being required by the Department of Defense for mission critical computer resources. Despite the results of this case study, the use of Ada over assembly language was still a topic of debate in the industry at the time.

The discussion in the comments revolves around various aspects of the Ada programming language and its usage in different industries. Some comments point out that modern CPUs and instruction scheduling techniques have made assembly language less necessary, while others argue that certain industries still rely on Ada for safety-critical systems. There are also mentions of other programming languages and their suitability for different applications. Some comments discuss personal experiences with Ada, including its use in defense contractors and aerospace systems. The discussion also touches on topics such as version control systems, job opportunities for Ada programmers, and the perception of ROI (return on investment) for different programming languages.
