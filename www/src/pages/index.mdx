The June 2024 issue of IEEE Spectrum delves into a thought-provoking analogy between online privacy and fishing. In the aftermath of a Microsoft spying incident involving state-backed hackers utilizing AI tools, questions arose about privacy expectations and surveillance practices. The comparison draws parallels from the world of fishing, where overfishing due to technological advances led to a decline in fish populations. The concept of "shifting baseline syndrome," as explained by scientist Daniel Pauly, highlights the tendency for each generation to accept a lower standard as normal, ultimately contributing to catastrophic consequences. This insightful article explores how evolving perspectives on privacy can be likened to the gradual decline in fish populations, urging a reevaluation of our understanding of online privacy in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

The discussion on the Hacker News thread primarily revolves around the concept of trust, progress, and societal implications related to different levels of trust in a society. Users discuss the idea of living in a low-trust society versus a high-trust society, drawing analogies between living off the grid and societal progress. They mention examples of individuals like Henry David Thoreau who lived a simple, off-grid lifestyle and its influence on societal development. Additionally, users analyze the dynamics of trust in different societies, with references to research articles and historical figures like Leo Tolstoy and Mahatma Gandhi. The conversation delves into the impact of trust on business, technology, and politics, exploring the implications of trust on individual well-being and societal advancement.

### DuckDuckGo offers “anonymous” access to AI chatbots through new service

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/06/duckduckgo-offers-anonymous-access-to-ai-chatbots-through-new-service/) | 34 points | by [leeny](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leeny) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40602327)

DuckDuckGo has introduced a new "AI Chat" service where users can interact with various mid-range large language models from different providers. Although the service strives to maintain privacy by anonymizing chats and deleting them after 30 days, there are still concerns about potential privacy vulnerabilities, especially with models like GPT-3.5. The available models have varying levels of accuracy and capability, with some still prone to confabulation and inaccuracies. While the service offers a novel experience, the practical utility of having fully private AI conversations with potentially error-prone outputs remains to be seen. Users are advised to approach the interactions with caution and verify information from other sources.

- **tmbrt** and **wkat4242** discuss the potential privacy risks associated with AI chatbots like Kagi Ultimate and ChatGPT. They raise concerns about the number of API calls made, with tmbrt mentioning that Kagi made 20,000 calls to GPT-4o. wkat4242 expresses skepticism about the privacy claims of these services.
- **prmstch** mentions the release of an article on June 6th, highlighting models like GPT-3.5, Claude, 3Llama, and Mixtral. **84ydk** comments on the active development of these models. **halJordan** adds a comment about traffic on California highways.
- **hm-nh** notes the fast performance of the Mixtral model.
- **hhdhdjhhgwv** cautions against the misleading perception of privacy provided by VPNs and proxy services in the context of AI chatbots. They give an example of AOL releasing search queries publicly in 2006, emphasizing the potential risks of data exposure. **lxgr** adds that anonymity in publishing can still reveal personal details through writing styles. hhdhdjhhgwv illustrates that using VPNs with AI models like DuckDuckGo's can only offer limited privacy and performance benefits. They also mention the trend of AI spam and the significance of building trustworthy privacy solutions.
- **halJordan** suggests making conversations private by joining the rest of the participants.

Overall, the discussion emphasizes the importance of understanding the privacy implications of AI chat services and the limitations of existing privacy protection measures like VPNs when interacting with language models.
