### Call Centers Introduce 'Emotion Canceling' AI as a 'Mental Shield' for Workers

#### [Submission URL](https://gizmodo.com/call-center-ai-softbank-softvoice-first-horizon-1851546327) | 13 points | by [ourmandave](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ourmandave) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40721488)

SoftBank and First Horizon Bank are delving into the realm of emotional support AI systems for call center employees, aiming to alleviate the stress and emotional strain these workers face daily. SoftBank's "emotion canceling" technology, SoftVoice, alters angry customer voices into calm tones, acting as a shield for operators. On the other hand, First Horizon had plans to send personalized family photo montages to employees on the verge of burnout, but it seems these plans have been put on hold. These initiatives may seem dystopian, but they highlight a transition towards AI potentially taking over customer service roles in the future. It's a peculiar limbo where AI is addressing the challenges of call center jobs while preparing to handle customer interactions independently.

The discussion on this submission includes contrasting views. 

- "rlph" appears to suggest that intervention in call centers may be necessary due to possible negative outcomes, such as 911 calls being crossed and intercepted, possibly leading to unpleasant experiences for callers.
- "slwt" argues that issues like miscommunication can arise when companies prioritize profit over the well-being of their employees, leading to a lack of protection for workers in challenging customer service roles. The comment expresses concerns about corporations prioritizing disruptive and degenerative behaviors over addressing mental health issues of highly demanding customers. The comment also criticizes the difficulty in delivering clear messages to corporations regarding unsustainable practices. In addition, there is a mention of creating an AI that could monitor the emotional activation of call center agents in real-time, providing questionable feedback that is perceived as aggravating. 
- "ymmypnt" compares the situation to the idea that whenever something goes wrong, companies like Microsoft (MS) just throw blame elsewhere and avoid taking responsibility.
- Lastly, "frtng" briefly mentions a specific technical aspect related to a 256-bit architecture that can handle certain types of loads.
