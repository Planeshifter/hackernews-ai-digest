A critical flaw has been discovered in the VAE (Variational Autoencoder) used for Stable Diffusion 1.x/2.x and other models, such as DALL-E 3. The flaw is likely due to bad training and affects the latent space created by the VAE. The latent space has a massive KL divergence and is smuggling global information about the image through a few pixels. This issue hampers the models that use this VAE. SDXL, on the other hand, has its own VAE and is not subject to this problem. The VAE is responsible for translating regular pixel-space images into a latent space that is smaller and easier for the diffusion model to process. Ideally, the latent space should be robust to noise, spatially related to RGB pixels, and able to accurately reconstruct the image. The issue with the KL-F8 encoder is that it produces a latent space with inconsistent log variance, characterized by a "black hole" that contains significant information about the entire image. This flaw hinders the training of new models and calls for caution when using the affected VAE.

XFaaS, a paper presented at the Symposium on Operating Systems Principles, describes Meta's internal system for serverless functions. XFaaS runs trillions of function calls per day on over 100,000 servers and addresses several challenges in running a large-scale serverless system. These challenges include handling load spikes, ensuring fast function startup and execution, global load balancing, resource utilization, and preventing overload of downstream services. 

The architecture of XFaaS consists of five main components: Submitter, load balancers, DurableQ, Scheduler, and Worker Pool. Clients schedule function execution through the Submitter, which interfaces with downstream components of the system. Load balancers ensure effective utilization of distributed system resources, and the Scheduler determines the order of function calls based on their criticality, execution deadline, and capacity quota. The Scheduler also uses a traffic matrix to decide if functions should be sourced from different regions for load balancing purposes. Worker Pool handles the execution of functions, and Locality Groups limit a function's execution to a subset of the pool to improve worker utilization.

XFaaS implements performance optimizations such as time-shifted computing, which allows flexibility in when a function executes, and cooperative JIT compilation. It also prevents overload of downstream services by implementing backpressure, a concept borrowed from TCP and other distributed systems.

Overall, XFaaS provides insights into Meta's serverless system and the challenges they faced in achieving hyperscale and low-cost serverless functions.

The discussion on this submission covers several aspects of serverless functions and their implementation. One commenter mentions that larger organizations often struggle with adopting new practices and mandates, while others discuss how Firebase is a good case study for successful serverless function implementation. The simplicity and fast deployment of serverless functions are highlighted, although there are concerns about the difficulty of maintaining codebases over time. Some commenters also discuss the potential benefits of using FaaS in contrast to traditional infrastructure providers. The discussion also touches on topics such as event-driven architecture, the importance of observability, and the trade-offs between serverless functions and other technologies like Kubernetes. There are varying opinions on the suitability of FaaS for different types of workloads and the role of infrastructure providers in managing hardware resources. The discussion also includes comments about the historical context of FaaS and its relation to disruptive technologies. Overall, the discussion provides additional insights and perspectives on the topic of serverless functions.
