### Binary vector embeddings are so cool

#### [Submission URL](https://emschwartz.me/binary-vector-embeddings-are-so-cool/) | 75 points | by [emschwartz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=emschwartz) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107196)

In a recent post that has captivated Hacker News, the impressive capabilities of binary quantized vector embeddings are brought to the forefront. These embeddings compress data up to 32 times while maintaining over 95% accuracy in retrieval and achieving around 25 times faster performance compared to traditional methods.

So, what exactly are embeddings? They transform text into numerical representations, allowing for efficient searches of semantically similar content. Typically, these embeddings use 32-bit floating point numbers, but binary quantization converts these to single bits—mapping positive weights to '1' and negative weights to '0'. This innovative technique not only reduces the size of the embeddings significantly, but it also retains a remarkable amount of information, providing high retrieval accuracy using Hamming distance instead of cosine similarity.

The article highlights findings from a blog post co-authored by MixedBread.ai and HuggingFace, illustrating that the binary quantized embeddings can shrink the original embedding size to just 3.125% with minimal loss in performance—making it akin to JPEG compression for images. Additionally, it explores a method known as Matryoshka embeddings, which arranges information hierarchically within the vector, allowing for further efficient dimension reduction.

Combining binary quantization with Matryoshka embeddings allows for even greater compression. For instance, achieving a 90.76% accuracy with an embedding only 1.56% the size of the original is nothing short of astounding. Beyond storage savings, these binary embeddings also dramatically speed up distance calculations, making them a game changer for computational efficiency.

The author shares a personal anecdote about transitioning to MixedBread's model for building a personalized content feed, reflecting the real-world impact of this technology. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, techniques like these are set to revolutionize how we handle and process large datasets.

One contributor emphasized the difficulty in scaling Hamming distance calculations across thousands of vectors, implying that traditional methods might serve better in some applications.

2. **Model Training Insights**: A discussion point arose about the implications of binary quantization during the training process. One participant questioned whether the model could benefit from flipping bits randomly with probabilities based on weights. This led to an exploration of potential advanced techniques for quantization during training.

3. **Integration with Existing Technologies**: There was mention of using vector embeddings with PostgreSQL, highlighting a scenario where innovative techniques are being integrated with popular database technologies.

4. **Dimensional Reduction**: Another contributor speculated about achieving quantization with fewer bits and the impact of careful design in mapping dimensions. This touches on the broader theme of enhancing computational efficiency in data representations.

5. **Potential Impacts of Non-linear Functions**: The role of non-linear activation functions like ReLU and Sigmoid in relation to Hamming distance and similarity contexts was discussed, exploring how different functions might influence the effectiveness of binary embeddings.

Overall, the conversation reflects a rich blend of technical considerations, theoretical exploration, and practical implications of using binary quantized vector embeddings in various applications.
