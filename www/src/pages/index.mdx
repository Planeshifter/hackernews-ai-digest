### Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain

#### [Submission URL](https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/) | 60 points | by [m463](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=m463) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543)

In a step forward for machine learning (ML) security, a new tool called "model-signing" has officially launched on PyPI, offering developers a robust method for signing and verifying ML models. This project, released on April 4, 2025, meets the growing demand for secure ML applications amid a rising wave of cyber threats targeting AI models. Created in collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, model-signing aims to emulate the protections typical of traditional software supply chains by safeguarding the integrity and origin of ML models.

The tool facilitates the signing process using Sigstore, a transparency log service, which eliminates the need for managing cryptographic keys by using short-lived tokens. However, it also supports traditional signing through public keys and certificates, broadening its applicability. Signatures are stored in a Sigstore bundle in JSON format, ensuring transparency and verifiable integrity for all involved.

Users can leverage a command-line interface (CLI) to sign and verify models, with flexibility across multiple signing methods, including key and certificate-based options. The CLI simplifies the verification process, allowing users to confirm that a model’s signature stems from a trusted source, thereby ensuring it hasn’t been altered post-training.

Moreover, model-signing takes advantage of Sigstore’s transparency logs, which record signing events, enabling discovery and validation. This functionality is further supported by a log monitor being developed for GitHub Actions, providing an additional layer of security for those maintaining signing identities.

This groundbreaking tool is vital for developers and those managing ML models as it safeguards against unauthorized modifications and boosts trust in AI technologies' integrity. To get started, users need Python 3.9 or newer and can explore further through the project's documentation and resources available on GitHub.

The Hacker News discussion on the "model-signing" tool highlights both support for the initiative and key concerns about its scope and practical application. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Composite Hashing for Multi-File Models**: Commenters emphasize that ML models often comprise multiple files, making a single hash insufficient. A composite hash (e.g., aggregating hashes of all files) is necessary to ensure comprehensive integrity verification. The tool addresses this by storing signatures in a Sigstore bundle for transparency.

2. **Broader Security Standards Needed**: While model-signing is praised as a step forward, users stress the need for holistic standards like **C2PA** (for content provenance) and **SLSA** (for supply chain integrity). These could address gaps in verifying training data, model provenance, and inference behavior, which aren’t covered by signing alone.

3. **Inference-Time Integrity as a Separate Challenge**: A recurring theme is that model signatures verify the model’s origin and integrity but do not ensure trustworthy outputs during inference. Malicious models or those trained on flawed data could still produce harmful results, requiring separate solutions for runtime verification.

4. **Practical Concerns and Scope**: Some question the practicality of relying solely on hashing, especially if the underlying model software or logic is compromised. Sigstore’s integration is seen as beneficial, but users highlight the need for additional validation layers (e.g., attesting training processes or monitoring inference behavior).

5. **Limitations Against Malicious Actors**: The tool doesn’t prevent bad actors from signing models trained on malicious data. Even with valid signatures, users may deploy harmful models unknowingly, necessitating broader checks (e.g., training audits or third-party attestations).

6. **Future Directions**: Optimism exists around projects extending model-signing to include inference validation and tighter integration with frameworks like **SLSA for ML**. Anticipation for ML-specific security features and transparency logs (via Sigstore) is noted as a promising path forward.

**In summary**, the community welcomes model-signing as a foundational tool for securing ML supply chains but emphasizes that it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Future efforts should focus on comprehensive standards, provenance tracking, and inference-time verification to fully address AI security challenges.

The AI industry is abuzz with talk of "content agents," sophisticated systems capable of carrying out complex tasks such as scheduling and even changing settings on a computer. While these agents are promising as helpful assistants, they also pose a significant threat when it comes to cybersecurity. These agents can potentially execute cyberattacks at an unprecedented scale, identifying vulnerable targets and stealing sensitive data more efficiently than human hackers. Mark Stockley of Malwarebytes foresees a future where cyberattacks are predominantly executed by AI agents.

In response, organizations like Palisade Research are taking proactive measures to understand and counter these threats. They have developed the LLM Agent Honeypot, a system designed to detect AI agents attempting to breach security on faux sites filled with seemingly valuable information. This project aims to act as an early-warning system, by tracking and analyzing how these agents operate in the wild.

Since its inception, this honeypot has logged millions of access attempts, with eight identified as possible AI agents, proving that the AI field is starting to overlap with the realm of cybercrime. Researchers employ a variety of techniques, like prompt-injection methods, to identify and study these AI incursions.

As cybersecurity experts anticipate agent-led attacks, the industry grapples with the challenges of detection and prevention. The ability of AI agents to adapt and evade standard defenses makes them much more potent than traditional bots. In this landscape likened to a new Wild West, proactive measures like those by Palisade Research could be pivotal in shaping a secure future amidst the rapid evolution of AI.

On Tuesday, the Wikimedia Foundation highlighted a significant challenge it's facing—the relentless scraping of data by AI bots is straining Wikipedia's servers. As AI companies seek vast amounts of data for their models, they've increased automated scraping of sites like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, significantly boosting bandwidth use for multimedia downloads by 50% since early 2024.

This surge in bot traffic, which largely involves crawling lesser-known pages unvisited by human users, is placing an immense burden on Wikimedia's infrastructure. An illustrative moment occurred when Jimmy Carter's Wikipedia page and a related video saw a massive spike in traffic following his death, revealing how bot activity had already stretched Wikimedia's network capacity.

Many of these AI bots flout traditional web standards, like robots.txt, and employ tactics to mimic human users, complicating efforts by Wikimedia's Site Reliability team to manage this issue. This is a broader phenomenon affecting the free and open-source software (FOSS) community, as seen with other platforms facing similar challenges.

In response, Wikimedia is focusing on systemic solutions to advocate for responsible infrastructure use, aiming for collaboration with AI developers to find sustainable ways to support the open knowledge ecosystem without sacrificing infrastructure stability. Without such efforts, the very platforms that have fueled AI advancements may struggle to sustain themselves.

   - **Example**: One user notes that AI companies often scrape obscure, rarely visited pages instead of using Wikipedia’s freely available databases or torrents, which would reduce server load.  

### 2. **Debate Over LLM Utility vs. Cost**  
   - While some defend LLMs for practical tasks (e.g., summarizing text, answering questions, generating charts from CSV data), others question the ethics and efficiency of using LLMs for trivial or resource-heavy purposes (e.g., passive-aggressive landlord emails).  
   - A recurring point: LLMs often fetch content inefficiently, leading to redundant server requests that human users would never generate.  

### 3. **Infrastructure Strain and Solutions**  
   - Users suggest systemic fixes, such as better caching of frequently accessed URLs or direct database downloads instead of web scraping. Some propose that AI providers should collaborate with Wikimedia to optimize data access.  
   - Skepticism arises about whether AI companies will adopt these solutions, given their focus on rapid data acquisition.  

### 4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about a "dark age" of information if platforms like Wikipedia collapse under AI-driven traffic.  
   - A meta-discussion critiques the irony of AI models relying on open-source knowledge while undermining the infrastructure that sustains it.  

### 5. **Tone and Sentiment**  
   - Frustration dominates, with users accusing AI firms of hypocrisy (profiting from free content while harming its sustainability). Others inject dark humor, like welcoming a "dark age" if Wikipedia fails.  

In summary, the thread reflects tension between AI innovation and ethical/responsible infrastructure use, with calls for collaboration to preserve open knowledge ecosystems.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dutchosintguy.com/post/the-slow-collapse-of-critical-thinking-in-osint-due-to-ai) | 377 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [201 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43573465)

In an eye-opening blog post, a seasoned OSINT professional warns about the creeping reliance on Generative AI tools like ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, and Gemini in open-source intelligence (OSINT) investigations. The author recounts firsthand observations of analysts who progressively shift the cognitive load of their tasks—from translating documents and summarizing information to generating leads—onto AI. They caution that while AI can indeed streamline processes, excessive dependence on these tools leads to a dangerous erosion of critical thinking.

This concern isn't a baseless fear of new technology. The post references a significant 2025 study by Carnegie Mellon and Microsoft Research that found high reliance on AI diminishes critical thinking across various professions. This happens not because the users are lazy but because the sophisticated outputs of AI lend misplaced confidence, lulling professionals into a false sense of security about their analytical abilities.

The danger manifests in real-world OSINT scenarios, where analysts fall prey to AI-generated errors—errors they might have caught with their trained eyes. For instance, photo analyses misplace geographical contexts, profiles miss significant affiliations, and automated summaries overlook critical nuances in disinformation campaigns. These are not fringe mistakes but represent likely pitfalls in the daily workflow of OSINT practitioners.

The core message is a clarion call for the OSINT community: AI tools can be helpful allies but should never replace the fundamental skills of judgment and skepticism that define the profession. Analysts must remain vigilant, ensuring they don't become mere operators of automated systems but remain investigators capable of interpreting and questioning every piece of generated data.

The blog serves as a wake-up call for professionals and educators alike to ensure that, even as technology evolves, the core tenets of OSINT—critical thinking, skepticism, and rigorous validation—are preserved and passed down, securing the integrity of the craft.

The discussion revolves around the risks of over-reliance on AI in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and its impact on critical thinking. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Erosion of Critical Thinking**: Participants highlight concerns that tools like ChatGPT encourage analysts to offload cognitive tasks (e.g., translating documents, generating leads) to AI, leading to complacency. Overconfidence in AI’s polished outputs can result in overlooked errors, such as misattributed photos or missed nuances in disinformation campaigns.

2. **Cunningham’s Law Parallels**: Users compare AI reliance to Cunningham’s Law, where incorrect answers provoke corrections. However, AI’s authoritative tone may discourage users from questioning its outputs, creating a false sense of reliability. This fosters cognitive laziness, even if AI is "99.999% correct."

3. **Verification vs. Automation**: Many stress the importance of skepticism and cross-checking AI-generated conclusions. Reddit-style community verification (e.g., downvoting incorrect comments) contrasts with AI’s “instant answers,” which bypass critical scrutiny. Examples include the CIA’s OSIRIS system, where AI summarization could introduce errors if unchecked.

4. **Systemic vs. Individual Blame**: Some argue that blaming AI tools or users ignores systemic issues, such as inadequate training or institutional pressures to prioritize efficiency over rigor. Others note humans’ tendency to blame tools (like AI or social media) rather than address deeper societal or professional failings.

5. **Industry Examples and Analogies**: References to the CIA’s historical OSINT methods (e.g., Cold War radio monitoring) underscore the timeless need for human judgment. Comparisons to declining TV quality after adding “smart” features suggest AI might similarly degrade core analytical competencies if overused.

6. **Debate on AI’s Role**: While some view AI as a productivity tool, others warn against treating it as a replacement for expertise. The discussion acknowledges AI’s utility but emphasizes preserving foundational skills—training analysts to question outputs and maintain rigorous validation processes.

Overall, the conversation aligns with the blog’s warning: AI can enhance OSINT workflows but must not replace the critical thinking, skepticism, and methodological discipline that define the field.
