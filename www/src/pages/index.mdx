Privacy4Cars released a new tool called the Vehicle Privacy Report that reveals how much information car manufacturers can collect from your vehicle's data. The tool creates privacy labels for what manufacturers collect and whom they share data with. Typically, most modern vehicles are like "smartphones on wheels," with the ability to collect significant amounts of data wirelessly and send the information to manufacturers. The Vehicle Privacy Report works by using a car's Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) and analyzing each manufacturer's public policy documents. The study showed Toyota collects personal information such as name, address, driving license number, phone number, email, and driving behavior, including acceleration, speed, braking functionality, and travel direction. It may also gather favorite locations saved on its systems and images taken by external cameras or sensors. Some models of Toyota cars can also scan drivers' faces for face recognition. It is unknown whether Toyota collects data from people's phones that are synced with its vehicles. Commenters in the discussion express varying opinions about data privacy, government regulation, and the role of car manufacturers in protecting consumer privacy.

### Many in the AI field think the bigger-is-better approach is running out of road

#### [Submission URL](https://www.economist.com/science-and-technology/2023/06/21/the-bigger-is-better-approach-to-ai-is-running-out-of-road) | 207 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [287 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36462282)

As the cost and strain of training and running AI models grows, researchers are beginning to focus on making these models more efficient, rather than simply larger. Instead of pursuing a bigger-is-better approach, the goal is to get more performance out of fewer resources. One approach is to optimize trade-offs, such as cutting the number of parameters but training models with more data, so they are smaller, faster, and cheaper to use. Another option is to use a similar rounding technique, which has been shown to cut down memory consumption, while some users are fine-tuning general-purpose LLMs to focus on a specific task. Google has invented a different option, which involves extracting specific knowledge from a larger model into a smaller, specialized one.

The comments section features a debate about the nature of language processing and the limits of deterministic systems in understanding and modeling language. Some participants argue that human language understanding is complex and probabilistic, and that current language models are limited in their ability to recognize nuanced meanings and higher level concepts. Others suggest that human reasoning is a deterministic process, and that deterministic systems can model language effectively given enough training data. There is also discussion about the potential and limitations of machine learning in emulating human cognitive processes and generating language.

### Open source licenses need to leave the 1980s and evolve to deal with AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/06/23/open_source_licenses_ai/) | 79 points | by [gumby](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gumby) | [103 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36444854)

Open source licenses and free software have yet to adequately evolve to handle AI models, which raise grayer legal issues than code-centric software. With programming datasets so reliant upon open source and free software code, Stefano Maffulli, executive director at Open Source Initiative, among other tech leaders, is looking into ways to align AI and open source licenses for more clarity. Concerns over copyright infringement and proprietary licenses mean that tech companies producing AI-generated code will ultimately regard them as private IP, just as software code was considered the property of the software company in previous years. Other discussions pertained to how to license datasets involved with AI models, despite how they don't fit under traditional copyright models, and the difficulties found with open sourcing medical data versus commercial LLM datasets, which are typically black boxes. Several organizations are collaborating on defining a common understanding of open source AI principles that they intend to use to lobby legislative bodies. In the ensuing discussion, users debated the legal issues regarding AI models, such as whether AI-generated weights should be considered copyrightable, and whether there is a clear precedent in copyright law for AI. Additionally, the discussion highlighted the complexities of licensing AI and how some view AI-generated data as non-copyrightable.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/millions-of-github-repos-likely-vulnerable-to-repojacking-researchers-say/) | 124 points | by [pyeri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pyeri) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36452322)

AquaSec's security team, Nautilus, has issued a warning that millions of repositories on GitHub may be vulnerable to dependency repository hijacking, or RepoJacking. The attack involves a malicious actor registering a username under the name of an older repository, used by an organisation that has since changed their name or had a change in ownership. Any project using the dependency of the attacked project will subsequently fetch dependencies and code from the attacker-controlled repository, which could contain malware. AquaSec scanned major organisations and found exploitable cases in repositories managed by Google and Lyft, in which vulnerable dependencies pointed to rogue repositories.

The discussion includes various comments, such as the difficulty of implementing global namespaces, the use of SSL certificates, and the dangers of compromised domain names. Furthermore, there are some comments about the importance of maintaining package lockfiles and regularly auditing packages for vulnerabilities in package managers like npm. The discussion also touches on GitHub integration systems and the differences between package managers such as npm and Python. Finally, there is a comment about potential alternatives to GitHub.

As a programmer, there is something very important that we are losing in today's world, according to an article on Hacker News. The author believes that programming should be telling us more than we are telling it, and that we've got it all backwards. Unlike other professions, when a programmer encounters a situation where conflicting meanings happen, each of which is correct, it is a much more profound piece of information to provide the client. The article ends with a quote from a friend: "I think some of the best programs were essays, in the sense that the authors didn't know when they started exactly what they were trying to write."

The submission on Hacker News discusses how programming should be telling us more than we are telling it. The discussion that follows explores the limitations of the current programming system, especially in the context of part-time employees, and the importance of abstractions. Some commenters argue that abstractions are broken, but others point out that they can be useful in creating a better understanding of complex concepts. Additionally, some commenters assert that different professionals have different approaches to their work and that there is no universal logical world. Others suggest that the key to solving business problems is dependent on the depth of knowledge and intelligence of the business partners and that there should be more personal learning opportunities. Overall, the conversation touches on the role of programming in the real world and the complexities it faces.

### From word models to world models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12672) | 97 points | by [dimmuborgir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dimmuborgir) | [100 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36445197)

A group of researchers has proposed a framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural models of language with probabilistic models for rational inference. The framework, called "rational meaning construction", views linguistic meaning as a context-sensitive mapping from natural language into a "probabilistic language of thought" (PLoT), which is a general-purpose symbolic substrate for probabilistic, generative world modeling. The paper illustrates the framework in action through examples covering four core domains from cognitive science and extends the framework to integrate cognitively-motivated symbolic modules to provide a unified, commonsense thinking interface from language.

A group of researchers have suggested a framework for language-informed thinking that combines neural models of language with probabilistic models for rational inference. However, several users are skeptical about the approach, with one argument being that the models currently lack high-quality training data and cannot answer complex questions. Some users believe that the language models' ability to understand the world in a limited symbolic representation is not fully effective for intelligence. Still, others contend that natural language processing is a vital step towards achieving artificial general intelligence. Some users suggest that the research illustrates the limitations of current large language models, while others argue that such models can drink and perform very well. There are also discussions about the capacity of humans to comprehend complex thought and whether machines can do likewise.

### Generating SQL with LLMs for fun and profit

#### [Submission URL](https://iamnotarobot.substack.com/p/generating-sql-with-llms-for-fun) | 63 points | by [diego](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=diego) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36440760)

Language models are being used to generate SQL code for querying databases, but this could lead to potentially dangerous situations if the generated SQL code is not thoroughly checked. As demonstrated by Diego Basch, language models can easily generate queries that alter or drop tables, and even create infinite loops. While attempts to train the model to recognize risky queries have been made, there is still a risk of prompt injection leading to SQL injection. Basch suggests making the database read-only or creating a restricted role for the language model to use as a preventive measure. However, language models should not yet be trusted to generate executable code on the fly.

The discussion on the submission suggests that language models are still not yet able to generate executable code on-the-fly and should be used with caution. There are also concerns about data security and measures to prevent unauthorized access to databases. Suggestions were made to create a read-only database or create a restricted role for the language model to use. The discussion also touched on the importance of manual tracking and overseeing the process of generating SQL code. However, solutions such as making database read-only or creating restricted access have its limitations. There is also a mention about how language models should not be trusted to generate code for production systems before being thoroughly tested. The commenters also discussed the potential dangers of prompt injection leading to SQL injections. One solution proposed was to enforce reasonable time limits and database permissions and to add security measures such as read-write security in PostgreSQL, to prevent unauthorized access to databases. Finally, a few commenters raised concerns about proper communication to the audience, where the content generated by language models should be closely monitored to avoid misunderstandings or potential risks.

### Giving LLM’s a Backspace Token

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.05426) | 76 points | by [bilsbie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bilsbie) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36425375)

Researchers Chris Cundy and Stefano Ermon have developed a new method called SequenceMatch for autoregressive sequence modeling with backtracking. Unlike the traditional maximum-likelihood objective method, SequenceMatch involves imitation learning (IL), allowing for a variety of divergences between the generated and dataset sequences, including those generated out of distribution. The model can also incorporate backtracking by introducing a backspace action into the generation process. SequenceMatch training has shown improvements in text generation over MLE on language models. The paper outlines the SequenceMatch-$\chi^2$ divergence as a more suitable training objective for autoregressive models. The discussion on the submission revolves around the latency and interactivity of the models and how they could be used in practical applications. Some have raised concerns about the validity of the evaluation metrics used in the study, while others have suggested exploring Beam search as an alternative to backtracking.

### How RLHF Works

#### [Submission URL](https://www.interconnects.ai/p/how-rlhf-works) | 159 points | by [natolambert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=natolambert) | [31 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36418807)

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) works when two conditions are met, according to Nathan Lambert, who says there needs to be some signal showing that applying vanilla supervised learning only does not work and a complex optimization landscape that needs to slowly change over time to achieve success. The setup, however, is hard and Lambert explains it using the example of generating chat agents that are both helpful and not spewing toxic statements, which requires a capable language large model to follow instructions and applying a combination of fine-tunings and systems engineering for the harm reduction half. Data practices that can tank model performance, such as imitating models and using imperfect datasets, should also be avoided.

The submission is about reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and how it works only under specific conditions, as explained by Nathan Lambert. Successful RLHF requires a signal that demonstrates that applying supervised learning algorithms does not work and a complex optimization landscape that changes slowly over time. The discussion revolved around various topics such as the Direct Preference Optimization paper, resources for RLHF, the applications of RLHF, and the challenges associated with creating models that generate content that conforms to human values. One commenter stressed the importance of honesty and truthfulness in the development of models, while others discussed the limitations of RLHF based on the data and features of the model.

#### [Submission URL](https://newatlas.com/technology/gps-alternative-muon-cosmic-rays-underground-underwater-navigation/) | 49 points | by [wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wjSgoWPm5bWAhXB) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36402086)

Researchers at the University of Tokyo have developed a proof-of-concept navigation system called the muometric wireless navigation system (MuWNS) that uses cosmic rays to track movement underground and underwater with precision of a few metres. Unlike GPS, which bounces signals off rocks, walls, and water, MuWNS tracks particles called muons that pass through solid materials. The particles are generated when cosmic rays enter the Earth’s atmosphere and produce a cascade of secondary particles. By tracking the paths of muons picked up by reference stations and a handheld detector, the scientists were able to trace the scientist's position with a high degree of precision deep inside a multi-story building.

One user points out that the technology is currently expensive and difficult to implement in real-time applications.

### AI: First New UI Paradigm in 60 Years?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ai-paradigm/) | 277 points | by [ssn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ssn) | [203 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36394569)

AI is introducing the third user-interface paradigm in computing history, shifting to a new interaction mechanism where users tell the computer what they want, not how to do it — thus reversing the locus of control. The newest paradigm, called intent-based outcome specification, is the first new interaction model in more than 60 years and is poised to replace graphical user interfaces as the dominant UX model. With the advent of conversational AI systems such as ChatGPT, the locus of control is shifted to the user rather than the computer, allowing for more natural and intuitive interaction. Some users argue that AI is limited in low-risk applications, while others object to the use of the term "hallucination" to describe AI errors. The conversation ultimately turns to the limitations of humans and how civilization has evolved to reduce variability and protect against unpredictable threats.

Camera Restricta is a potential new kind of camera that uses GPS to locate itself and searches online for photos that have been geotagged nearby, to prevent the user from contributing to the overflow of generic digital imagery. It blocks the viewfinder if it decides that too many photos have been taken at that location and could be funded or subsidised by public or private sector institutions to regulate photography in certain places. While it could be controversial and be seen as a tool for censorship, it could be used to create unique and special photos of a place and limit the number of photos taken in a given location. The camera features a retractable shutter, antenna, speaker, and a smartphone that handles GPS and data connection, generating sounds and acting as the camera screen. The project is not only a political statement about censorship but also questions our photographic practice and introduces new limitations to prevent an overflow of digital imagery.

In the discussion, some users approve of the idea, stating that it could prevent an overflow of generic digital imagery and promote creativity, while others criticize it, calling it a tool for censorship. Some users suggest that limiting the number of photos taken in a location could lead to unique and special photos, while others argue that good photography relies on composition and lighting rather than location. There is also some discussion about the camera's technical features and its potential use in various settings. Overall, the discussion is a mix of support and skepticism towards the concept of Camera Restricta.

### LLMs can label data as well as human annotators, but 20 times faster

#### [Submission URL](https://www.refuel.ai/blog-posts/llm-labeling-technical-report) | 49 points | by [nihit-desai](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nihit-desai) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36384015)

Refuel, an AI company, has introduced a benchmark for evaluating performance of Language Model Models (LLMs) for labeling text datasets. The benchmark aims to compare the performance of LLMs and human annotators on three axes: quality, turnaround time and cost. The company found that LLMs can label text datasets with comparable quality to skilled human annotators, but 20 times faster and seven times cheaper. The benchmark also found that GPT-4 is the best choice for achieving the highest quality labels, while GPT-3.5-turbo, PaLM-2 and open source models like FLAN-T5-XXL are compelling for achieving the best tradeoff between label quality and cost.

The comments on the Hacker News submission express some skepticism of the benchmark and discuss concerns around LLMs replacing human annotators, PII (personally identifiable information) privacy issues, and the existence of true ground truth in human annotation. Some users share their own experiences with text labeling and suggest alternatives to LLMs, while others argue for the benefits of LLMs in speeding up and reducing the cost of text labeling tasks.

### Google Go language goes with opt-in telemetry

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2023/05/17/googles_go_data_collection/) | 37 points | by [el_hacker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=el_hacker) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36380292)

The stewards of Google's open-source Go language (Golang) have announced that they will implement software telemetry on an opt-in basis rather than turning data collection on by default and requiring developers to opt-out. This decision was made due to objections from Go developers who were concerned about data collection without permission. Many users also pointed out that Google, an advertising platform, had consistently opposed opt-in data collection. The telemetry will consist of recording various events like cache hits, feature usage, latency, and more to a local file. According to Russ Cox, the Golang tech lead at Google, even with "tens of thousands of users opted in, we should be able to get helpful data".

The discussion on the submission revolves around the topic of telemetry and whether it should be opt-in by default or not. Some believe that opt-in is the right approach, and Google, being an advertising platform, was hypocritical for not adopting this approach earlier. Others argue that telemetry is reasonable and essential for improving user experience and finding and fixing bugs. However, some users question the effectiveness of telemetry in environments with forwarded or repurposed networks and whether it can cause performance delays and false configuration overhead. There is also a debate over what level of telemetry should be considered reasonable and sufficient. Some respondents suggest an explanatory approach to telemetry, and others point out that the concern is overstated, citing examples of other applications and services that use telemetry.

### Researchers warn of ‘model collapse’ as AI trains on AI-generated content

#### [Submission URL](https://venturebeat.com/ai/the-ai-feedback-loop-researchers-warn-of-model-collapse-as-ai-trains-on-ai-generated-content/) | 78 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36368848)

Researchers from the UK and Canada have discovered that as AI-generated content proliferates, it causes "irreversible defects" in generative AI, leading to poorer performance over time and a distortion of reality. The use of model-generated data in AI training ultimately leads to what is called model collapse, which means that the AI learns based on other models, dropping the true underlying data distribution for mistakes. These mistakes in generated data compound over time, ultimately leading the AI model to misperceive reality.

There was also a discussion about the limitations of generative AI models and the potential implications for human-AI interaction, along with some suggestions for potential solutions such as a more systematic training approach and the use of multiple AI models. Additionally, there were some concerns about the exploitation of AI-generated content for profit and the need for privacy laws to limit access to human data.
