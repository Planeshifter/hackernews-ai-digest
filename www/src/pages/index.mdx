### Classifying customer messages with LLMs vs traditional ML

#### [Submission URL](https://www.trygloo.com/blog/classify-text-llms-learnings) | 248 points | by [hellovai](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hellovai) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36681839)

A recent post on Hacker News shared five key learnings from classifying 500k customer messages using Language Models (LLMs) compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The first learning emphasized that LLMs tend to prefer generating some output rather than none, leading to false-positives. To address this, the authors added a catch-all class like "other" to account for this tendency. 

The second learning highlighted the usefulness of tracking hallucinations, which are instances where the LLMs generate labels that are not present in the prompt. By analyzing these hallucinations, the authors found that simple and direct class names improved accuracy. They noted ongoing research regarding replacing class names with symbols to avoid bias towards using the class names themselves. The third learning emphasized the cost and latency advantages of using fine-tuned classification models in combination with LLMs. In one instance, a customer required lower-latency processing, so the authors trained Sentence-BERT (SBERT) using ChatGPT-labeled data. This approach achieved 85% parity with ChatGPT and over 90% accuracy on a subset of classes.

The fourth learning described "prompt engineering" as a well-known technique to enhance accuracy in text classification. By prompting the LLM to extract relevant clues before classification, state-of-the-art accuracy (96%+) can be achieved. The fifth learning stressed the importance of standardizing input for both fine-tuned models and LLMs. Longer text inputs can lead to less accurate predictions. To address this, the authors applied a preprocessing step to paraphrase the last user message with the previous context, particularly for multi-context chat messages, emails, long documents, and non-English messages.

The discussion on the Hacker News post includes various points and perspectives on the topic of using Language Models (LLMs) for text classification. Here are the key points that were discussed:

- Some users mentioned the use of keyword-based approaches or TF-IDF vectors for text classification, pointing out that the technique described in the post seemed to be categorizing and extracting semantic meaning from the text.
- Others noted that LLMs can be slower than traditional machine learning models and can be resource-intensive, especially when trained on large datasets.
- The topic of sentence embeddings and text embeddings was brought up, with some users expressing difficulty in understanding the underlying mathematics and concepts.
- A comparison was made between LLMs and attention algorithms, noting that they both have similar mechanisms.
- The relevance of the discussion to zero-shot learning was mentioned, with some users pointing out that although the technique described in the post is related, it is not exactly the same as zero-shot learning.
- The potential applications of LLMs in various domains and their ability to create novel solutions were discussed.
- Some users expressed skepticism and questioned the accuracy and reliability of LLMs for text classification tasks.

Overall, the discussion provided a mix of opinions and insights into the topic, with users sharing their experiences and raising interesting points for further exploration.

### Chat-based Large Language Models replicate the mechanisms of a psychic’s con

#### [Submission URL](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/) | 24 points | by [EventH-](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EventH-) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36586540)

In a thought-provoking article, Baldur Bjarnason investigates the phenomenon of language models, specifically chat-based large language models (LLMs), being perceived as intelligent. Bjarnason argues that LLMs are not capable of reasoning or thinking like humans do, as they are merely mathematical models of language tokens. He presents two possible explanations for the intelligence illusion: either the tech industry has unintentionally developed a completely new kind of mind, or the illusion lies in the mind of the user. Bjarnason aligns himself with the latter camp, drawing a parallel between the intelligence illusion and the tactics used by psychics in cold reading. By employing validation statements and statistically probable guesses, both chatbots and psychics create the illusion of intelligence and specificity. Bjarnason suggests that the rise of chat-based LLMs has unintentionally resulted in an automation of the psychic con, where users are tricked into perceiving an intelligence that doesn't truly exist.

The discussion in the comments starts with a user expressing frustration with system administrators and suggesting that GPT-4, a large language model (LLM), might help solve system problems. Another user points out that defining intelligence is a subjective and fluff-filled discussion, and that minimizing attention given to doubts and definitions can hinder understanding. Another commenter is impressed by LLMs' ability to understand instructions to some extent, giving an example of using LLMs for debugging. However, they argue that LLMs' capabilities are limited to statistical matching rather than true intelligence. A user counters this argument by suggesting that intelligence can be learned through training data, mentioning the concept of predictive coding and the recursive identification of models within the human brain. They propose that LLMs could potentially reach a level of intelligence similar to humans. Someone else brings up the objective view that LLMs simply produce text based on probabilistic matrices and do not actually possess intelligence. They argue that LLMs mimic structures but lack the complexity for reasoning and consciousness. Another user agrees with this view, stating that the development of LLMs has not led to the invention of a new kind of mind, but rather the tech industry stumbled upon unknown principles and processes. They assert that intelligence lies in the mind of the user rather than the LLM itself. Finally, there is a mention of the challenges scientists face in understanding the intricacies of the human brain. A user sarcastically remarks that people impressed with LLMs should reconsider granting machines rights, hinting at potential issues surrounding artificial intelligence and its impact on society. One user concludes the discussion by referring to "scientism," suggesting that there is an overreliance on science as an ideology.

In a refreshing twist on AI implementation, a California man has created a business that uses chatbots to frustrate telemarketing scammers. The Jolly Roger Telephone Company offers customers the ability to merge their calls with chatbots that engage the scammers in bizarre and nonsensical conversations, ultimately wasting their time. The company has a range of bots available, each with their own unique voice and quirks. Not only does this business provide entertainment for those annoyed by telemarketers, it also serves as an effective tool against scammers. The Jolly Roger Telephone Company has thousands of subscribers paying $23.80 a year for the service.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of telemarketing scams and the use of chatbots to counter them. Some commenters discuss the technical implementation and efficacy of using chatbots to frustrate scammers, while others highlight the potential ethical and legal concerns.  One commenter suggests using machine learning or AI-powered call blockers instead of chatbots, mentioning that the computational resources wasted on engaging with scammers could be better used elsewhere. Another commenter argues that relying on external networks and third-party services for call-blocking could pose security risks and may not be ideal from a privacy standpoint.  There is also a discussion on the terminology used, particularly the term "telemarketing," with some pointing out that it traditionally refers to phone calls and not online advertising or billboards. The conversation diverges into debates about free speech, the regulation of advertising, and the banning of billboards in certain states.  Commenters express concerns about the limitations and potential abuse of AI-powered systems, such as flooding emergency services with fake calls or spamming local businesses with negative reviews. Some also discuss the challenges of identity verification and the potential for AI-powered bots to handle sensitive information in the future. The discussion ends with a couple of comments highlighting examples of AI implementation in other contexts and imagining the potential consequences of widespread adoption of AI.
