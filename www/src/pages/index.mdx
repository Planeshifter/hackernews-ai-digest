Researchers at Flower Labs have demonstrated the power of federated learning by fine-tuning OpenAI's Whisper model for keyword spotting. This blog post provides a code example that shows how to perform this downstream task in a federated manner. By leveraging large models trained on publicly available data and federating the learning process, Flower ensures client privacy without the need to copy data to a central server. The example walks through the process of designing a federated learning pipeline with Flower for keyword spotting classification using a pre-trained Whisper encoder. The pipeline consists of client-server interactions, where the server samples clients and sends them the classification head. Each client trains the classification head using its own data and communicates the updated head back to the server. The server then aggregates the heads and sends a new global head to the clients in the next round. The researchers used the Google SpeechCommands dataset and achieved over 97% accuracy in classifying keywords after just a few rounds of training.
