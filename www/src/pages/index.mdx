### IBM releases first-ever 1k-qubit quantum chip

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03854-1) | 38 points | by [birriel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birriel) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38520757)

IBM has announced the development of the first quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits – the quantum equivalent of digital bits in a classical computer. However, instead of continuing to increase the number of qubits in its machines, IBM will now focus on improving error resistance. Quantum states are notoriously prone to errors, and IBM plans to address this issue by using error-correction techniques that would require fewer physical qubits. The company aims to build chips designed to hold a few error-corrected qubits in about 400 physical qubits and network them together. This approach could reduce the number of physical qubits needed for useful computations by a factor of 10 or more. IBM's road map for its quantum research envisions achieving useful computations within the next decade.

The discussion on this submission primarily revolves around the topic of logical qubits and error-correction techniques in quantum computing. One user, vlovich123, points out that the reported numbers of qubits in quantum computers may refer to logical qubits rather than physical qubits. They mention that research generally indicates that error-correction techniques require around 1000 physical qubits for each logical qubit, and express excitement about an alternative error-correction scheme called quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) that could reduce this ratio by a factor of 10.

Another user, d-bcn, argues that 10 logical qubits defined on just one physical qubit is a reasonable definition of a logical qubit and highlights Google's work on quantum error correction. They discuss experiments that demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum error correction using 13 physical qubits and note that other groups have also achieved small-scale logical qubits with improved performance.

In response to vlovich123's earlier comment, d-bcn mentions that they have likely managed to create a logical qubit, pointing to experimental evidence from Egan and Google. They provide links to two experiments that showed small improvements in logical performance, although the improvements were relatively small in scale.

In conclusion, the discussion involves a technical debate about the definition and implementation of logical qubits, as well as the advancements and challenges in error-correction techniques for quantum computing.

Mozilla's innovation group has released an open-source method called "llamafile" to turn a set of weights into a single binary file, making it easier to distribute and run Large Language Models (LLMs). Llamafile supports six different operating systems and ensures that a particular version of an LLM remains consistent and reproducible. It uses the "Cosmopolitan" build-once-run-anywhere framework created by Justine Tunney, along with the llama.cpp tool. Sample binaries using different LLMs are available, with the LLaVA 1.5 LLM being the only one that can run on Windows due to the 4 GB limit on executable files.

The discussion about the submission revolves around the technical aspects of llamafile and how it can be beneficial in distributing and running Large Language Models (LLMs). Some users mention that distributing LLMs as multiple files can be challenging to distribute, as changes and tweaks to the software can lead to different results with different versions. One user mentions that llamafile supports multiple operating systems including macOS, Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, and NetBSD. They also point out that using llamafile dramatically simplifies the distribution process of LLMs, ensuring that a specific version of an LLM remains consistent and reproducible indefinitely. Another user notes that llamafile relies on the Cosmopolitan build-once-run-anywhere framework developed by Justine Tunney, specifically llama.cpp. This framework is commended for its efficiency in running self-hosted LLMs. In the comments, a link to a related discussion is shared. It is not clear what the specific topic of that discussion is.

Finally, one user simply mentions "ppl" (presumably referring to people) and "llmcpp" without further clarification, leaving their comment's meaning open to interpretation.

### Run 70B LLM Inference on a Single 4GB GPU with This New Technique

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.gopubby.com/unbelievable-run-70b-llm-inference-on-a-single-4gb-gpu-with-this-new-technique-93e2057c7eeb?gi=cbe7920f4cd2) | 108 points | by [gardenfelder](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gardenfelder) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38508571)

Have you ever wondered if it's possible to run inference on a single GPU with a large language model? Well, Gavin Li has come up with a new technique that allows you to do just that. In a recent article, he explains the key techniques for extreme memory optimization of large models. The most critical technique is layer-wise inference. By leveraging the divide and conquer approach, Li shows that you don't actually need to keep all layers in GPU memory. Instead, you can load whichever layer is needed from disk when executing that layer, do all the calculations, and then free up the memory. This significantly reduces the GPU memory required per layer.

Li also introduces flash attention, which is a critical optimization for large language models. Flash attention deeply optimizes CUDA memory access to achieve multi-fold speedups for inference and training. This optimization reduces the memory complexity from O(n²) to O(n), making it much more efficient. To further optimize the memory usage, Li discusses model file sharding. The original model file is typically sharded into multiple chunks, but loading the entire file for each layer execution wastes a lot of memory and disk reading time. By pre-processing the model file and sharding it by layers, the memory usage is minimized. To implement these techniques, Li utilizes the meta device feature provided by HuggingFace Accelerate. The meta device is a virtual device designed for running ultra large models. It allows you to dynamically transfer parts of the model from the meta device to a real device like the CPU or GPU during execution, reducing memory usage. If you're interested in trying out these optimizations for yourself, Li has open-sourced the code in a library called AirLLM. The library, which can be found on the Anima GitHub, allows you to achieve extreme memory optimization with just a few lines of code.

So there you have it, with these techniques and the AirLLM library, you can run inference on a single 4GB GPU with a 70B large language model. It's truly unbelievable!

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of running inference on a single GPU with a large language model. Here are some key points from the comments:

- One commenter mentions that they tried running the techniques on a GTX 1060 6GB GPU but found it to be slow, taking 13 hours to generate a sentence. They speculate that the GPU memory usage might be the bottleneck.
- Another commenter discusses the technique of model file sharding and suggests looking into PyTorch's gradient checkpointing for efficient memory usage.
- A discussion arises regarding the difference in performance between CPU and GPU inference. Some commenters mention that CPU inference is typically limited by memory bandwidth, whereas GPU inference benefits from loading weights onto the GPU. SSD loading of weights is also mentioned as a way to reduce GPU memory usage.
- There is some skepticism raised regarding the capabilities of non-batched inference for large language models. Commenters mention that certain context and historical understanding provided by complete sentences might be necessary for relevant embeddings and projections in custom matrix operations.
- The potential drawbacks of extreme memory optimization are also discussed, with one commenter pointing out that the process seems to swap VRAM to RAM and disk, which can significantly impact performance.
- Various optimization techniques and resources are shared, including libraries such as AirLLM and llmcpp, as well as discussions on quantizing models and using DirectStorage for improved IO.
- Further discussions revolve around distributed computing and the benefits of using multiple GPUs to process different layers simultaneously, though latency is a concern in such setups.

Overall, the discussion explores different techniques, optimizations, and limitations related to running inference on a single GPU with a large language model.
