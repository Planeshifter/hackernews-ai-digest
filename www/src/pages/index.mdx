### Why AI is failing at giving good advice

#### [Submission URL](https://maximzubarev.com/why-ai-is-failing-at-giving-good-advice) | 28 points | by [mxmzb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mxmzb) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40162915)

In a thought-provoking examination, Maxim Zubarev delves into why AI often falls short in offering meaningful advice. Drawing on the limitations inherent in machine learning models like ChatGPT, which rely on statistical probabilities derived from vast amounts of internet data, Zubarev asserts that the resulting advice tends to be generic, lacking the depth and nuance that human experience and empathy can impart. Through a fascinating exploration of how ChatGPT processes language input mathematically, Zubarev highlights the inherent constraints of relying on text-based algorithms for personalized guidance. The article underscores that while AI excels at explaining concepts, it struggles to provide truly insightful, tailored advice that resonates with individuals on a deep level.

By dissecting a public experiment where ChatGPT was tasked with generating money-making strategies, Zubarev exposes the disconnect between algorithmic responses and real-world success. Despite the AI's ability to regurgitate popular online narratives, its recommendations often lack practicality and genuine understanding of complex human endeavors like entrepreneurship. Ultimately, Zubarev argues that AI, although proficient at processing information, falls short in replicating the nuanced guidance and empathy offered by human mentors or teachers. While AI may excel at certain tasks, the art of providing genuinely helpful and personalized advice remains a realm where human intuition and experience still reign supreme.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission primarily revolves around the limitations and capabilities of AI models like ChatGPT in providing meaningful advice to users. NiagaraThistle brings up Pieter Levels as an example of successful AI-driven therapy and suggests that AI can offer good results but may not be perfect. Joker_vD discusses how rephrasing or paraphrasing internet-related text can lead to ambiguous answers. In response, mxmzb mentions the importance of giving individuals helpful and specific advice.

tv talks about how people tend to trust their friends and coworkers more than a device like ChatGPT when it comes to providing accurate information. In contrast, ltxr points out that people may confidently provide incorrect information, emphasizing the importance of learning from mistakes and correcting them. vbrsl highlights the value of AI in certain tasks but argues that true personalized guidance comes from human understanding and empathy. On the other hand, vsrg delves into the nature of AI models and their ability to learn from feedback to improve over time.

CuriouslyC discusses the perspective of GPT in providing advice based on varying viewpoints. asp_hornet brings up the challenge of AI understanding alternative perspectives. jkthgy shares a personal experience where traditional therapy was more helpful compared to AI solutions like GPT.

Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of viewpoints on the abilities and limitations of AI in providing personalized, insightful advice compared to human mentors or therapists.

### The "it" in AI models is the dataset

#### [Submission URL](https://nonint.com/2023/06/10/the-it-in-ai-models-is-the-dataset/) | 101 points | by [alvivar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alvivar) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40152908)

OpenAI's researcher, reflecting on a year of training generative models, realizes that regardless of different configurations and hyperparameters, the models all converge to similar results by approximating their datasets extremely well. This remarkable finding suggests that with enough complexity, all models narrow down to the same point when trained on the same data for a sufficient duration. Surprisingly, it's not the architecture or training choices that determine a model's behavior, but the dataset itself. This insight implies that the key to model differences lies in the data rather than in the model's structure, shedding light on how models like Lambda, ChatGPT, Bard, or Claude are essentially representations of their datasets, not just their weights.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the significance of model architecture and hyperparameters in machine learning. Some commenters emphasize the importance of the right architecture in achieving success, while others argue that the dataset plays a more critical role in determining model behavior.

### Make Invalid States Unrepresentable

#### [Submission URL](https://geeklaunch.io/blog/make-invalid-states-unrepresentable/) | 69 points | by [satvikpendem](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=satvikpendem) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40150159)

Today's top story on Hacker News dives deep into the realm of programming types. The post emphasizes the importance of utilizing powerful type systems in languages like Rust to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime, resulting in clearer and more robust code.

Types define the range of allowable states for data in an application, with legally representable states ($\mathbb{R}$) and valid, handleable states ($\mathbb{V}$) often differing. By minimizing the gap between these sets, developers can reduce bugs either by handling more cases or by restricting the representable states.

An example with colors illustrates this concept effectively. By defining a custom Color data structure with specific variants for RGB and RGBA colors, developers can ensure that all representable states are valid, eliminating the need for extensive runtime error handling.

This approach offers several benefits, including improved code separation, early validation guarantees, reduced complexity in business logic, enforced consistency through compile-time errors, and enhanced code readability and maintainability in larger projects.

The post concludes by suggesting that aligning data types with business logic can lead to more robust and understandable code, using examples such as a modal text editor akin to Vim to showcase the advantages of structuring data types effectively.

The discussion on the top story about programming types covers a range of topics related to data type management and software development practices.
