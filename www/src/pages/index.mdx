### Code for the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm, commonly used in LLM tokenization

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/karpathy/minbpe) | 66 points | by [magoghm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=magoghm) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39407407)

The repository "minbpe" by karpathy provides minimal and clean code for the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm, commonly used in Large Language Models (LLMs) tokenization. The BPE algorithm operates at the byte level on UTF-8 encoded strings and has been popularized by papers like GPT-2 and GPT-4 for training tokenizers. 

The repository includes two tokenizers: BasicTokenizer and RegexTokenizer, with RegexTokenizer extending the text splitting by categories before tokenization approach. There's also a GPT4Tokenizer that replicates tokenization in GPT-4. The provided `train.py` script demonstrates training the tokenizers on input text and saving the vocabulary for visualization. 

Usage examples are given in the code files, showcasing how to train, encode, and decode text using the implemented tokenizers. There are future plans to optimize the Python version for handling large files, potentially create a C or Rust version, and explore adding support for GPT-2 with a renamed tokenizer. Additionally, there is a plan to create a LlamaTokenizer inspired by SentencePiece and handle special tokens.

This repository is licensed under the MIT license and has garnered attention with 1.9k stars and 78 forks on GitHub.

### Recording and visualising the 20k system calls it takes to "import seaborn"

#### [Submission URL](http://blog.mattstuchlik.com/2024/02/16/counting-syscalls-in-python.html) | 106 points | by [sYnfo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sYnfo) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39402868)

Today's top story on Hacker News delves into the world of system calls (syscalls) and how to analyze them using a new tool added to Cirron. The tool, called Tracer, allows you to see exactly what syscalls a piece of Python code is making. It works by using the strace tool to trace the system calls, capturing the output in a file for later analysis.

For example, tracing a simple print("Hello") statement reveals that it ultimately maps to a write syscall, writing the string "Hello\n" to stdout with some interesting details like the number of bytes written and the time taken for the call. 

Furthermore, the author tracks the syscalls generated by importing Seaborn library and finds that it results in around 20,000 syscalls which can be overwhelming to analyze manually. To overcome this, they introduce Perfetto Trace Viewer as a tool to visualize and analyze the syscall traces more efficiently. By converting the Tracer output to Trace Event Format, one can load the trace into Perfetto for detailed analysis.

Overall, the article provides a fascinating insight into how syscalls can be traced and analyzed using the Cirron tool, demonstrating a unique way to gain deeper understanding of the system-level operations carried out by Python code.

### V-JEPA: Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA) Model

#### [Submission URL](https://ai.meta.com/blog/v-jepa-yann-lecun-ai-model-video-joint-embedding-predictive-architecture/) | 62 points | by [agnosticmantis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=agnosticmantis) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39392104)

Today, the tech world is buzzing with the release of the Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture (V-JEPA), a significant leap towards achieving advanced machine intelligence as envisioned by Yann LeCun. This model excels at understanding detailed interactions between objects in a physical world model. Released under a Creative Commons license, V-JEPA aims to pave the way for more grounded machine intelligence.

V-JEPA operates by predicting missing parts of a video in an abstract space, enhancing training efficiency by up to 6x. The model uses self-supervised learning, pre-training solely with unlabeled data, and then adapts to specific tasks with labeled examples. By focusing on abstract representations rather than specific pixel details, V-JEPA demonstrates improved learning efficiency.

The unique masking strategy of V-JEPA ensures that the model learns complex aspects of the world by predicting masked spatio-temporal regions in videos. This approach makes the model adept at frozen evaluations, enabling efficient adaptation to new skills with minimal additional training.

Excitingly, V-JEPA outshines other video models in label efficiency, proving its effectiveness in low-shot settings. As the tech world marches towards more human-like machine intelligence, V-JEPA's release marks a significant milestone in this journey.

### Safe and reliable production changes, and how Rivian recently got this wrong

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.substrate.tools/safe-and-reliable-production-changes-for-fast-moving-teams-and-how-rivian-recently-got-this-wrong/) | 58 points | by [kelp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kelp) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39386611)

A recent over-the-air (OTA) software update to Rivian vehicles went wrong, causing the infotainment screens to go into a reboot loop. While the vehicles were still drivable, many controls were unavailable for several days while Rivian worked on a fix. This incident raises questions about the process and design flaws at Rivian. One suggestion is to have a canary fleet of vehicles that receive updates first to catch any issues before they reach customer vehicles. Another recommendation is to have a pre-flight check that validates the update before installation, which could have prevented the faulty update from being installed. Additionally, implementing an automatic rollback mechanism for failed updates could minimize downtime. It's important to note that there is rarely a single root cause for such incidents, but rather a combination of mistakes, bugs, or design flaws.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the recent software update issue faced by Rivian vehicles. Some users suggest that Rivian should implement pre-flight testing and canary fleet testing to catch any issues before they reach customer vehicles. Others draw comparisons to Volvo's recent software problems and highlight the risks of over-the-air updates. The importance of thorough testing and the potential benefits of automatic rollback mechanisms are also mentioned. The discussion diverges into debates about the reliability of software in vehicles, the weighing of heavy trucks versus passenger cars, and the importance of public transportation infrastructure.
