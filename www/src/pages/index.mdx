### Does current AI represent a dead end?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bcs.org/articles-opinion-and-research/does-current-ai-represent-a-dead-end/) | 510 points | by [jnord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jnord) | [962 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42521865)

In a recent thought-provoking article, Professor Eerke Boiten from De Montfort University Leicester argues that the current state of artificial intelligence—largely dominated by large neural networks and systems like ChatGPT—poses fundamental challenges for responsible software engineering. He contends that these AI models are inherently unmanageable, making their application in critical areas irresponsible. 

Boiten critiques the prevalent attitude toward AI development, suggesting that the community has neglected accountability and ethical considerations in favor of unchecked technological advancement. He highlights two major issues: the prevalent lack of scrutiny regarding the data feeding these AI systems—a process he links to the rise of “surveillance capitalism”—and the troubling idea that the outcomes of AI algorithms are not the responsibility of their creators.

Further, he distinguishes between the emergent properties of AI systems and the principle of compositionality that underlies effective software engineering. While compositionality allows for the modular development of software, Boiten asserts that current AI systems defy this approach due to their opaque and unpredictable nature. As a result, he raises a critical question about whether current AI technology represents a dead end, where complexities in management and accountability prevent its safe deployment in any serious context.

Boiten's insights highlight the urgent need for a reevaluation of AI ethics and the processes governing its development, suggesting that without a shift towards responsible practices, the promise of AI may just lead us to a perilous crossroads.

In the discussion surrounding Professor Eerke Boiten's article on the challenges of artificial intelligence, participants express a range of perspectives regarding the implications of large neural networks and AI systems on software engineering and society.

Several commenters highlight their long-term observations of neural networks, with some discussing their experiences working with these technologies and the evolution of AI.

### OpenAI is Visa – Buttering up the government to retain a monopoly

#### [Submission URL](https://sherwood.news/tech/openai-is-visa/) | 245 points | by [gpi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gpi) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42517260)

In a recent analysis by Taylor Lorenz, OpenAI is likened to Visa in its approach to dominating the artificial intelligence landscape. As Visa faced competition from emerging digital payment providers, OpenAI is grappling with rivals like Google, Meta, and Amazon, all of which are rolling out their own large language models. Lorenz suggests that OpenAI is attempting to solidify its market position not purely through technological innovation, but by creating barriers that limit competition—much like Visa did in the payment processing industry.

OpenAI's projected revenue of $100 billion by 2029 comes with the acknowledgment that the technology powering this growth—large language models—may soon be widely accessible, turning the innovative edge into a commodity. In response, OpenAI has been lobbying for regulatory measures that could stifle competition while also securing exclusive deals with investors and firms, as seen in its recent funding rounds. This strategy, aimed at making OpenAI the default choice for AI applications, raises questions about the sustainability of such a competitive moat in an evolving tech landscape.

However, as Musk becomes a notable challenger and political winds shift regarding AI regulation, OpenAI may face significant hurdles in maintaining its edge. The article underscores a key takeaway: in the battle for AI supremacy, competition may yet prove to be the ultimate loser.

In the discussion surrounding Taylor Lorenz's analysis comparing OpenAI to Visa, several users express skepticism about the parallels drawn between the two companies. One commenter, "insane_dreamer," questions whether Visa's regulatory influence truly helped maintain its monopoly and suggests that the article lacks strong supporting evidence. The conversation then dives deeper into the regulatory dynamics, discussing how OpenAI's push for AI regulations might aim to reduce competition akin to Visa's strategies.

Another user, "Spooky23," highlights the problematic nature of credit card systems where consumers and small businesses often bear the costs, emphasizing a lack of incentive for credit card companies to offer fairer terms, similar to the issues OpenAI might face in establishing a competitive edge. Comments also touch on the broader implications of financial regulation and competitive practices, with references to how large corporations navigate their advantages over smaller players.

While some participants debate the nuances of Visa's market impact, they acknowledge that the tech landscape's evolving nature might bring significant competition that challenges OpenAI’s current strategies. Overall, there is uncertainty surrounding whether OpenAI's approach can effectively secure long-term dominance in a rapidly changing AI ecosystem, with some indicating that such tactics could ultimately backfire as competition increases.

As AI heavyweights like OpenAI, DeepMind, and xAI continue their quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), one intrepid developer decided to take the challenge into his own hands. On Christmas Day 2024, inspired by the frustration with not seeing AGI realized yet, he shared his candid account of attempting to create his own version, despite lacking expertise in machine learning and neuroscience.

Drawing an analogy to a struggling Formula 1 driver, he recognized that following established paths (such as deep learning) would lead to inevitable defeat. With this in mind, he opted for an unconventional route, diving into concepts from neuroscience to create an asynchronous neural network on the Tokio runtime in Rust.

Through his exploration, he illustrated the intricacies of a neuron's function using a simplified model that highlights neuron components—dendrites, cell body, and axon—while lamenting the limited understanding of how brains truly operate. He mused about various types of neurons and the potential of information encoding in neuron firing times versus rates.

Despite acknowledging the complexity he might face, he proposed that his biologically inspired design could leverage emergent properties of neuron configurations, hinting at possibilities for something akin to consciousness within the network.

With ambitious implementation plans utilizing Tokio for its fast asynchronous features, he detailed his neuron struct and its communication-oriented architecture. His approach—bold, albeit filled with uncertainty and inherent challenges—raises questions about the nature of intelligence itself and what truly defines consciousness.

In this insightful piece, the reader is encouraged to ponder the possibilities and limitations of AGI through the lens of one man's earnest experiment, showcasing both the excitement and vulnerability inherent in pioneering AI frontiers.
