### AutoBNN: Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2024/03/autobnn-probabilistic-time-series.html?m=1) | 57 points | by [simonpure](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonpure) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39862828)

Google Research has introduced AutoBNN, a groundbreaking open-source tool that combines the interpretability of traditional Bayesian approaches with the power and scalability of neural networks for time series forecasting. This new package, written in JAX, automates the process of discovering interpretable forecasting models and provides reliable uncertainty estimates, all while delivering efficient performance on large datasets. AutoBNN utilizes a compositional structure, similar to Gaussian processes, with learned Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) that replace GPs while retaining the compositional kernel architecture. The BNNs offer advantages over GPs, such as improved computational efficiency, better hardware acceleration compatibility, and the ability to seamlessly integrate with deep neural networks for feature discovery.

By leveraging techniques such as Sequential Monte Carlo and incorporating innovative components like a OneLayer kernel, a ChangePoint operator, and a WeightedSum operator with learnable mixing weights, AutoBNN enables users to perform "soft" structure discovery by training a linear combination of various potential models. Overall, AutoBNN brings together the best of both worlds by enhancing predictive accuracy, interpretability, and scalability in time series forecasting, making it a valuable addition to the toolkit of data scientists and researchers working in this domain.

1. **HuShifang**: HuShifang emphasizes the advantages of using Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) over Gaussian Processes (GPs) for time series forecasting. They mention that training large GPs can be computationally expensive due to the traditional training algorithms scaling poorly with the number of data points in the time series. In contrast, training BNNs scales approximately linearly with the number of data points. BNNs are also well-suited for hardware acceleration on GPUs and TPUs. They suggest that Hilbert Space Gaussian Processes (HSGPs) might be relevant in this context and highlight their potential benefits over conventional GPs, such as improved performance. However, they point out that HSGPs lack domain expertise and suggest that AutoBNN could be a suitable alternative.

2. **chaz6**: chaz6 mentions their work on developing a non-parametric matrix model for the National Grid to predict gas supplies. The model considers various factors like weather-related variables, temperature, wind, and public holidays to forecast against the current Service Level Agreement (SLA) performance. This approach aims to enhance the response to variable factors affecting gas reserves.

3. **mlndnky**: mlndnky expresses amazement at the rapid pace of advancements in time series frameworks. They find the theoretical aspects intriguing but suggest that in practice, it may be challenging to implement and benefit from such cutting-edge technologies. They point out the inherent trade-offs between practicality and theoretical sophistication in the field. Additionally, they mention the preferences of the Deep Learning (DL) community for practices like using PyTorch over TensorFlow and suggest exploring new avenues in time series forecasting research that leverage novel techniques like LSTMs.
