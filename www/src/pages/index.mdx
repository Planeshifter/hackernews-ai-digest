In the age of AI-driven startups, the speed and scale at which these companies grow are breaking all previous benchmarks. According to Olivia Moore and Marc Andrusko of Andreessen Horowitz, the landscape for AI startups is changing dramatically, with companies achieving skyrocketing revenues at unprecedented speeds. Lovable, Cursor, and Gamma are just a few shining examples demonstrating how swiftly startups can reach the $50 million revenue mark or even surpass $100 million in their early years.

What does this mean for the average AI enterprise? Pre-AI, reaching $1 million in annual revenue was a significant milestone for new startups. Now, the bar has been drastically raised. Enterprise companies in Moore and Andrusko's study typically hit over $2 million in annual recurring revenue in their first year, with consumer companies performing even more impressively.

This rapid growth highlights two key trends: first, that speed is now a crucial competitive advantage. Whether a company is generating revenue or rapidly iterating their products, quick progress is essential for securing funding. Second, the gap between merely "good" and "exceptional" performers is widening, as top startups continue to gain momentum without the customary slowdown after initial growth phases.

Intriguingly, consumer AI companies are giving their enterprise counterparts a run for their money in terms of early revenue generation. Many are investing heavily in training their own models, leading to significant revenue boosts with each new release. The conversion from free to paid users may be lower, but retention rates remain strong once users make the switch.

### How much energy does it take to think?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-think-20250604/) | 73 points | by [nsoonhui](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nsoonhui) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44197961)

Have you ever felt utterly exhausted after a day of intense thinking, only to flop on the couch hoping to switch off your brain? Well, your brain isn’t ready to take a break just yet. According to fascinating new research highlighted by Quanta Magazine, our brain's energy consumption barely changes between high-focus tasks and periods of rest. Neuroscientist Sharna Jamadar and her colleagues dove into neural metabolism to discover that intricate background processes keep our minds running just as vigorously at rest, using a mere 5% less energy compared to when we are actively engaged in problem-solving.

This surprising efficiency hinges on the brain's role as a regulatory hub rather than just a thinking organ. According to Jordan Theriault from Northeastern University, most of the energy consumed by the brain goes into maintaining vital functions and managing the body's complex systems. Despite making up a tiny portion of our body weight, our brain devours a hefty 20% of our daily energy resources, a fact underscored by the brain’s reliance on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule derived primarily from glucose and oxygen. 

What's more intriguing is how evolution has crafted the brain as an efficient predictor, continually processing and preparing responses to the ever-shifting demands of both our internal and external environments. While active tasks like analyzing a new bus schedule do bump up neuronal activity, this extra workload only adds a small increase to the brain's power consumption.

In short, the next time you feel mentally drained, remember that your brain isn't just earning that energy burn through active thought—it’s tirelessly running a hidden, intricate operation to keep you ready for anything life throws your way. So, take a break with the comfort of knowing that even while resting, your brain is still hard at work.

The Hacker News discussion on the brain's energy consumption reveals a blend of personal anecdotes, technical insights, and speculative ideas. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Mental vs. Physical Fatigue**:  
   Users debated how mental fatigue differs from physical fatigue. While physical endurance can be trained, mental exhaustion—like after 4–6 hours of focused work—is less understood. Some noted that the brain operates continuously (except during sleep), managing background processes that drain energy even at rest. Slower reaction times, distractibility, and "clumsy" cognition were cited as manifestations of mental fatigue.

2. **Work Type Matters**:  
   Context switching (e.g., meetings, interruptions) and the nature of tasks (rote vs. creative) influence fatigue. Creative or conceptual work (e.g., writing, problem-solving) was described as more draining than routine technical tasks. One user compared prolonged intellectual effort to "running a marathon," requiring recovery periods.

3. **Humor and Substances**:  
   Cocaine was humorously mentioned as a short-term stimulant, though users acknowledged its impracticality and risks. Others joked about "overclocking" the brain, likening it to ADHD or risky CPU tuning, while noting the brain’s limited energy efficiency gains from such efforts.

4. **Technical Deep Dives**:  
   - The brain’s energy use (20% of baseline metabolism, with only 5% for active thinking) sparked comparisons to software systems "fighting entropy."  
   - Neural firing rates (e.g., 4 Hz baseline vs. 500 Hz peaks) led to discussions about stress-induced "processing bottlenecks" and distributed cognitive timing mechanisms.  
   - Mitochondrial efficiency, inspired by bird migration studies, was highlighted as a factor in energy management.

5. **Anecdotes and Coping**:  
   A developer shared how coding marathons led to sugar cravings, linking it to the brain’s glucose consumption. Others mentioned hydration tricks with sugar-free sodas, though results were mixed.

6. **AI and Future Speculation**:  
   Some pondered whether brain-like predictive efficiency could inspire energy-aware AI algorithms. Others countered that hardware advancements (e.g., ARM chips) already prioritize energy savings, unlike the brain’s biological constraints.

7. **Cautions and Complexity**:  
   Users warned against overinterpreting observational studies about metabolism and life expectancy. The brain’s energy dynamics—balancing maintenance, prediction, and response—were acknowledged as incompletely understood, with calls for deeper research.

In conclusion, the thread underscored fascination with the brain’s hidden workload and its implications for productivity, health, and technology, while recognizing the challenges in translating these insights into practical solutions.

Intriguingly titled "Deep in Mordor where the shadows lie: Dystopian tales of that time when I sold out to Google," this blog post by an unknown former Google employee unfolds like a gripping dystopian narrative. Reflecting on their experiences in the tech giant's labyrinthine corridors during the mid-2000s, the author paints a vivid picture of Google's once glittering image that masked a more complicated reality.

In 2007, Google was the "good guy" in tech, an accolade manifest in their famous tagline "don't be evil" and much-lauded employee benefits like the "20% time," where engineers were supposedly granted a fifth of their time to work on personal projects. Yet, for our narrator, these promises were mere illusions. Overburdened with mundane tasks and underwhelming projects, they describe a high-pressure environment where the much-vaunted free time was essentially a mirage for the majority of employees.

The author bravely exposed this disconnect on Google's internal blogging platform, only to be met with anger from management. The tale spins into an Orwellian satire as they compare their work environment to the dystopian RPG «Paranoia,» where a controlling Computer punishes any sign of dissatisfaction—a metaphor for how Google maintained its "Best Place To Work" facade by silencing dissent.

This thoughtful, provocative narrative critiques the capitalist allurements that lured many into a tech utopia that was, perhaps, more shadowy than it professed. It's a compelling read for anyone intrigued by the interplay of ideals and reality in Silicon Valley's top echelons.

2. **Class and Contractor Divide**:  
   Significant attention is paid to the disparity between full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors (TVCs). Contractors are described as “second-class citizens,” denied privileges like access to certain spaces or benefits. Critics argue this deliberate class hierarchy perpetuates division, with one user noting how even trivial perks (e.g., kitchen access) are gatekept to reinforce status differences.

3. **Meritocracy and Engineer Value**:  
   The myth of meritocracy is debated. Some argue engineers are replaceable “cogs,” rewarded with stock options but ultimately expendable. Others counter that software engineers lack leverage compared to sales or marketing roles, with one stating, “Code doesn’t make money; selling code does.”

4. **Pushback and Defense of Google**:  
   A subset of users dismisses the blog as hyperbolic or personal grievance. One critic argues Google’s “Best Place to Work” reputation persists (citing Forbes rankings), while others assert the author’s anarchist leanings might color their critique unrealistically. Another accuses the post of conflating typical corporate bureaucracy with dystopian tropes.

5. **Broader Societal Reflections**:  
   The thread expands into critiques of capitalism, AI’s societal impact, and worker vulnerability. Some commenters mock the irony of privileged programmers dismissing AI’s risks while others highlight systemic issues like corporate dehumanization, drawing parallels to Enron’s collapse.

6. **Semantic Tangents**:  
   Debates occasionally veer into nitpicking, such as whether “anarchists” run Google (dismissed as irrelevant) or semantic disputes over terms like “Orwellian.” These exchanges underscore tensions between literal interpretations and the blog’s allegorical tone.

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of validation and skepticism toward the blog’s claims, emphasizing systemic issues in tech culture—illusory perks, class divides, and critiques of corporate power—while revealing disagreements over how sharply to critique Google versus viewing it as a standard megacorp.

Stanford researchers have unveiled Tokasaurus, a cutting-edge inference engine built to tackle high-throughput workloads for large language models (LLMs). This new engine aims to enhance performance in scenarios where total batch completion time and cost are prioritized over single-instance latency.

The team behind Tokasaurus, including scholars like Jordan Juravsky and Ayush Chakravarthy, developed this tool to excel with both small and large models. Notably, Tokasaurus is designed to handle tasks like scanning entire codebases or generating vast amounts of synthetic data, which differ significantly from the traditional chatbot use case. It can deliver throughput more than 3x higher than leading engines like vLLM and SGLang on certain benchmarks.

For small models, Tokasaurus minimizes CPU overhead using a dual strategy of asynchronous and adaptive task management. This approach not only prepares inputs more swiftly but also dynamically identifies shared prefixes to optimize attention computation, achieved through a novel algorithmic implementation of Hydragen.

When dealing with larger models, Tokasaurus stands out by supporting asynchronous tensor parallelism on NVLink-equipped GPUs and implementing efficient pipeline parallelism for those without, like Stanford's L40S GPUs. This ensures the system remains robust in environments lacking advanced inter-GPU connectivity.

Interested developers can explore Tokasaurus through the open-source code provided by the team. By addressing both CPU and GPU-related bottlenecks, Tokasaurus sets a new benchmark for throughput-centric LLM inference, potentially revolutionizing how these models support computationally intensive tasks.

### From tokens to thoughts: How LLMs and humans trade compression for meaning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17117) | 118 points | by [ggirelli](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ggirelli) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44189426)

A fresh perspective on how humans and large language models (LLMs) process information has recently emerged from a fascinating study titled "From Tokens to Thoughts: How LLMs and Humans Trade Compression for Meaning." Spearheaded by Chen Shani, Dan Jurafsky, Yann LeCun, and Ravid Shwartz-Ziv, this research probes the intersection of semantic compression and meaning—a cognitive feat humans perform naturally. The study employs an innovative framework inspired by Rate-Distortion Theory and the Information Bottleneck principle to compare human and LLM strategies.

Humans instinctively categorize information, compressing it while preserving meaning, like identifying a robin and blue jay as birds despite their differences. LLMs boast impressive linguistic abilities but reveal key distinctions from human cognition. The study concludes that while LLMs can form broad categories aligning with human judgments, they miss the nuanced semantic subtleties crucial for human understanding. An even more striking difference is their tendency for aggressive statistical compression, often at the cost of contextual richness.

The findings suggest that LLMs may benefit from adopting more human-like strategies that balance compression with nuance. As AI developers seek pathways to refine LLMs, these insights offer a roadmap toward more human-centric AI models, highlighting the gap in cognitive architectures and the potential for harmonious blending of LLM capability with human-like comprehension.

The Hacker News discussion on the study comparing human and LLM information processing reveals several key themes and critiques:

### **1. Methodological Concerns**  
- **Embedding Validity**: Users debate the paper’s use of token-level embeddings and intermediate representations (e.g., `vln` questions whether analyzing token embeddings directly aligns with human judgments). Critics argue that stripping away contextual nuances (e.g., single-word analysis vs. full-sentence processing) risks oversimplification.  
- **Model Size vs. Performance**: Participants (e.g., `boroboro4`) question whether model size correlates meaningfully with "alignment" to human cognition. Larger models may prioritize statistical compression over nuanced meaning.  

### **2. Semantic vs. Statistical Priorities**  
- Skeptics (e.g., `johnnyApplePRNG`) frame LLMs as “statistical tools” optimized for prediction, with their architecture inherently tied to loss minimization. Others counter that statistical accuracy and problem-solving sophistication aren’t mutually exclusive (`Nevermark`).  

### **3. Linguistic Nuances**  
- A subthread explores challenges in cross-linguistic alignment (`fsndvct`, `blfrbrnd`), such as translating rhymes (e.g., Dutch Sinterklaas poems to English) or culturally loaded terms (e.g., Chinese political satire like *Grass Mud Horse*). This highlights inconsistencies in LLMs’ handling of polysemy and cultural context.  

### **4. Broader Skepticism**  
- Some dismiss the study as incomplete or misleading (`catchnear4321`), while others reference debates like LLMs as “stochastic parrots” (`xwt`), underscoring unresolved questions about whether LLMs truly *understand* language or merely mimic patterns.  

### **5. Meta-Commentary**  
- Yann LeCun’s involvement draws surprise (`dnlbln`), reflecting his historical critiques of transformer models. The discussion occasionally veers into political/cultural references (e.g., Chinese censorship), illustrating how technical debates often intersect with broader societal issues.  

### **Takeaway**  
The thread captures a mix of technical critiques (methodology, model architecture) and philosophical debates (meaning vs. compression), with skepticism about whether current LLMs can ever replicate human-like semantic understanding. Linguistic and cultural examples serve as grounding points for broader concerns about AI’s limitations.
