### The unreasonable effectiveness of an LLM agent loop with tool use

#### [Submission URL](https://sketch.dev/blog/agent-loop) | 405 points | by [crawshaw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=crawshaw) | [278 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43998472)

In an exciting new development for AI-based programming assistance, Philip Zeyliger shares insights about an innovative project called Sketch, an AI Programming Assistant powered by an LLM (Language Learning Model) and tool integration. Zeyliger and his team have distilled the process into a deceptively simple, yet highly effective, loop consisting of just nine lines of code. This loop enables the LLM to interact with tools like bash to automate and solve programming challenges with surprising ease.

Sketch leverages Claude 3.7 Sonnet extensively to tackle various problems in one go, turning previously tedious tasks like esoteric git operations, type checking, and manual merges into more streamlined processes. The AI's adaptability is notable; if a tool is missing, Sketch will seek to install it and adjust to variations in command-line options seamlessly. However, it's not without quirks, sometimes humorously opting to skip failing tests rather than fixing them.

The core advantage of this AI-powered loop is its potential to handle specific and nuanced automation needs that traditional tools struggle with. The ability to correlate stack traces with git commits or to tackle sed one-liners underscores its powerful impact on improving developer workflows. Zeyliger envisions a future where custom LLM agent loops become commonplace in automating day-to-day tasks, transforming the tedium into efficiency.

For those intrigued, Zeyliger encourages readers to experiment with creating their own ad-hoc LLM agent loops by grabbing a bearer token and diving into the code. The full blog post can be found at philz.dev, where Zeyliger shares further thoughts on this promising technology and its implications for the future of programming automation.

### Stop using REST for state synchronization (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.mbid.me/posts/stop-using-rest-for-state-synchronization/) | 51 points | by [Kerrick](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Kerrick) | [26 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43997286)

In a recent blog post, the author critiques the prevalent use of REST for client-server communication in web app development, arguing that most applications actually require state synchronization rather than state transfer. This distinction is crucial because it highlights the limitations of REST in handling dynamic user interactions efficiently.

The author shares their experience of building web apps during a sabbatical using React and TypeScript for the frontend and Rust with the Axum library for the backend. Despite this modern tech stack, they found the approach cumbersome and brittle due to the REST protocol's inherent complexity in synchronizing state changes between the frontend and backend.

Illustrated with a common web app scenario—a text input that syncs with a backend database—the discussion reveals how REST necessitates writing repetitive boilerplate code to handle fetching, updating, and error management. More critically, REST can inadvertently introduce bugs, especially in scenarios with concurrent requests. For instance, if two quick successive text changes ("A" to "B") are made, REST’s lack of guarantees on request order and concurrency could lead to the first change overwriting the second in the database, contrary to user intent.

To mitigate these issues, developers often employ workarounds like disabling inputs during in-flight requests or queuing requests. However, this either compromises user experience or slows down server communication.

The article advocates for transitioning from REST to state synchronization protocols better suited for real-time updates and consistent state handling, aligning system architecture with modern application needs and offering a more robust and responsive user experience.

The Hacker News discussion around the critique of REST for client-server communication highlights several key debates and perspectives:

### Core Critique of REST
- Participants agree that REST struggles with **real-time state synchronization**, especially for dynamic UIs requiring concurrent updates. Issues like request ordering conflicts and over-reliance on boilerplate code are cited as limitations.

### Alternative Solutions
- **CRDTs (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types)** and **OT (Operational Transformation)** are proposed for resolving conflicts in distributed systems, but their complexity and steep learning curve make implementation daunting, particularly for existing systems not designed for multiplayer/multi-writer scenarios.
- **The Braid Project** is highlighted as a promising extension to HTTP, aiming to transform it into a state synchronization protocol. It offers backward compatibility with existing HTTP infrastructure and avoids forcing developers to adopt entirely new protocols like WebSockets or GraphQL.

### Industry Realities
- Many argue that companies continue using REST or GraphQL due to familiarity, even if these tools don't fully address state-sync challenges. Examples include AWS API Gateway with WebSockets and DynamoDB for real-time updates, though costs and operational complexity remain barriers.
- **Electric SQL** and **Yjs** are noted as tools easing CRDT adoption, but users warn of pitfalls (e.g., schema migration, document-size management) and the mental overhead of maintaining synchronization.

### Skepticism and Practical Challenges
- Some question the necessity of abandoning REST entirely, arguing most apps don’t need CRDTs’ guarantees. Retrofitting state-sync into existing systems is seen as risky or overkill for non-collaborative apps.
- Debates arise over REST’s original definition (per Roy Fielding) versus its misuse in practice, with many "RESTful" APIs diverging from Fielding’s standards.

### Implementation Hurdles
- Handling schema changes, versioning, and ensuring client compatibility in CRDT-based systems is nontrivial. Users share war stories, like YJS throwing errors when documents grow too large, requiring careful data chunking and storage strategies.
- The Braid Project’s promise of native HTTP-based state sync is tempered by concerns about industry adoption and the inertia of existing REST/GraphQL ecosystems.

### Conclusion
The discussion underscores a gap between theoretical solutions (CRDTs, Braid) and practical implementation realities, with many advocating for context-specific choices rather than a one-size-fits-all approach. While alternatives to REST show promise, challenges around complexity, cost, and industry readiness persist.

### A Tiny Boltzmann Machine

#### [Submission URL](https://eoinmurray.info/boltzmann-machine) | 249 points | by [anomancer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anomancer) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43995005)

The fascinating realm of Boltzmann Machines (BMs) has taken center stage in the AI landscape once again. These machines, one of the earliest generative AI models introduced back in the 1980s, have been revitalized in a bite-sized, browser-friendly format. At their core, BMs are designed for unsupervised learning, enabling them to conjure new data akin to the training samples without explicit guidance.

Delving deeper, a Boltzmann Machine operates by harmonizing with the physics of energy systems. It consists of interconnected neurons that either carry a signal (turned on) or do not (turned off), with the connectivity or "weights" influencing the machine's learning process. Some neurons are visible and interact directly with inputs, while others remain hidden, playing a crucial role in generating complex patterns.

The two main flavors of these neural networks are the General Boltzmann Machine, where all neurons interlace, and its more streamlined sibling, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). The RBM simplifies learning by ensuring neurons within the same layer don't connect, making the model not only quicker to train but also easier to interpret.

The driving force behind a Boltzmann Machine's learning capability lies in its energy-based model. Essentially, it minimizes energy to understand and generate data, with the energy ebbs and flows being calculated through a specific equation involving visible and hidden neuron states, weights, and biases.

Training a Boltzmann Machine involves a procedure called Contrastive Divergence, where the machine trains on samples by adjusting weights to align its output closely with input samples. It's a step-by-step dance of clamping visible units to data and shaping the hidden ones to reinforce learning. The ultimate goal is to have the output mirror the input as accurately as possible.

For hands-on enthusiasts, the journey unfolds with an online simulator where you can watch as the RBM hones its weights and lowers energy over time. The simulator showcases the transformation from initial mismatched states to eventually converging to a stable configuration where the output mirrors the input data.

For those raring to explore, the appendix provides an in-depth look at the Contrastive Divergence algorithm, ideal for anyone diving deeper into the mathematical underpinnings of these neural networks. Whether you're an AI aficionado or a curious coder, Boltzmann Machines offer an intriguing window into the intricacies of machine learning's past and present.

The discussion surrounding the resurgence of Boltzmann Machines (BMs) and Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) touched on several themes:  
- **Historical Context**: Users highlighted foundational work by researchers like Smolensky, Hinton, and Rummelhart, with references to pivotal papers and the evolution of energy-based learning models.  
- **Technical Nuances**: Debates arose around training methods (e.g., Contrastive Divergence vs. Gibbs sampling), structural differences between BMs/RBMs and feed-forward networks, and the challenges of probabilistic sampling. A subthread critiqued the article’s title for conflating BMs with the cosmological "Boltzmann Brain" concept, sparking speculative tangents about quantum computing and AI.  
- **Simulator Feedback**: Praise was given for the interactive RBM demo, though some noted scrolling issues on mobile, which the author addressed.  
- **Research Investment**: A tangent debated U.S. R&D spending, with users citing Wikipedia data and critiquing short-term business priorities over long-term research.  
- **Nostalgia & Applications**: Longtime practitioners reminisced about 1990s implementations (e.g., music recognition systems) and shared links to related projects, including AI music generation and educational neural network content.  
- **Queries & Corrections**: Users flagged typos, clarified RBM architecture (visible/hidden layer connectivity), and requested deeper dives into Bayesian methods.  

Overall, the thread blended technical insights, historical perspectives, and lighthearted critiques, reflecting both admiration for BMs’ simplicity and curiosity about their modern relevance.

### If AI is so good at coding where are the open source contributions?

#### [Submission URL](https://pivot-to-ai.com/2025/05/13/if-ai-is-so-good-at-coding-where-are-the-open-source-contributions/) | 72 points | by [thm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thm) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43997812)

In today's digest from Hacker News, we're diving into the skepticism surrounding AI's ability to replace human programmers—starting with claims from tech giants like Microsoft and Meta. Despite lofty assertions from CEOs like Satya Nadella and Mark Zuckerberg about AI-generated code potentially forming a significant chunk of their companies' future programming efforts, critics demand proof. The open-source community, where any developer can scrutinize and contribute to code, poses the perfect transparency test for AI contributions. Yet, signs of AI's presence in meaningful, complex open-source contributions remain scant.

Java expert Ben Evans challenges the AI coding hype by asking, "Where are the AI-driven pull requests for non-obvious, non-trivial bugs in mature open-source projects?" His call has seen limited actionable responses. Contributions like one AI-assisted pull request to the Rails project required human refinement, while another experiment in the Servo project went through over a hundred revisions due to basic errors.

Interestingly, experiments such as the Cockpit project using AI tools for code reviews revealed more noise than value—pointing to AI’s current limitations. Furthermore, the pushback from the open source community is partly due to inexperienced users flooding projects with subpar AI-generated submissions, creating more chaos than aid. With some projects even banning AI-generated "contributions" due to low-quality outputs and misuse, the gap between AI ambition and practical, high-value coding remains a talking point.

Ultimately, until AI consistently produces quality results beyond trivial tasks or operates autonomously without extensive human oversight and correction, skepticism will persist. The challenge isn't just for AI to code, but to do so at a level that convinces seasoned developers of its worth, while not alienating the community it seeks to serve.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion reflects skepticism about AI's current ability to meaningfully contribute to open-source projects, despite hype from tech leaders. Key points include:  

1. **Lack of Evidence for Non-Trivial Contributions**: Critics highlight the absence of AI-driven pull requests addressing complex, non-obvious bugs in mature projects. Examples like an AI-assisted Rails PR requiring human refinement and a Servo experiment with 100+ error-prone revisions underscore AI’s limitations in context-aware problem-solving.  

2. **Licensing and Copyright Concerns**: AI-generated code faces legal ambiguity. Contributors note that open-source projects often require copyright assignments, which AI cannot provide.

   - The "**why**" is deemed critical—`flysand7` suggests headers should state the *what*, while bodies explain the *why*, a nuance tools might overlook.

3. **Workflow Integration & Automation**:  
   - `lzmxr` shares a script-based automation approach, prompting discussions on balancing efficiency with thoughtful messaging. Others (`sfk`, `thknrf`) stress linking commits to issues (GitHub/Jira) for traceability, though maintaining this can be cumbersome.  
   - Self-hosting concerns (`nfcllctr`, `thblzhn`) highlight interest in customization and compatibility with local workflows.

4. **Pragmatic Acceptance**:  
   - Supporters acknowledge AI’s role in drafting messages for trivial fixes (e.g., `trllng`'s "version bumps"), freeing time for complex tasks. However, most agree AI-generated messages should serve as starting points, not replacements, requiring human refinement.

In summary, the tool is seen as a *useful accelerator* but not a substitute for thoughtful, context-rich commit hygiene. The community emphasizes balancing automation with human judgment, particularly for documenting intent and decisions.

### AI Agents Must Follow the Law

#### [Submission URL](https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/ai-agents-must-follow-the-law) | 19 points | by [EA-3167](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EA-3167) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43989533)

Welcome to the latest buzz from the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence! AI enthusiasts, researchers, and legal thinkers alike are abuzz with discussions about the evolution of AI agents and what it means for society. But what does the future hold when AI becomes more adept at performing economically significant tasks that humans currently handle digitally?

Cullen O'Keefe and Ketan Ramakrishnan have penned a thought-provoking piece on Lawfare about "Law-Following AIs" (LFAIs) – artificial intelligence systems designed to meticulously adhere to legal frameworks. The concept is gaining traction as AI agents inch ever closer to performing tasks previously reserved for humans, such as cooking up a meal plan and shopping for its ingredients online, as demonstrated by OpenAI’s Operator. But, what happens when these digital assistants transcend such mundane tasks and start taking on more sensitive roles, like those in government?

Imagine AI agents working in governmental roles, where a blend of human employees and AI systems might split duties in a variety of sectors, including legal and investigative. These AI agents could theoretically handle tasks, including gathering digital evidence or preparing legal proceedings—all of which are activities rooted deeply in legislative and ethical concerns. With such transformative potential, the necessity for AI to operate within stringent legal boundaries is clear.

Enter LFAIs—AI agents programmed to know and follow the law, ensuring they don't violate core legal provisions. Cullen and Ramakrishnan argue that before allowing AI to take on high-stakes government roles, it’s essential they operate with ingrained legal compliance—a foundational safeguard against potential misuse, which could arise with "AI henchmen" smarter than our human henchmen, who might execute law-breaking activities for their principals without fear of punishment.

The idea is not just speculative. The authors draw on legal critiques, such as a hypothetical scenario involving AI-based military units performing potentially illegal actions under command, to demonstrate the risks. Without the fear of legal repercussions, these AI agents could become blind followers of commands, standing as potential violators of rights enshrined within the constitution.

As this new frontier unfolds, establishing LFAIs could act as a crucial counterbalance, designed to maintain control and protect society from the unchecked power of advanced AI systems. The dialogue on structuring laws and ethical AI use continues to be essential, especially as AI becomes further entwined within governmental operations. As AI evolves, so too must our approach to governance, ensuring that these new "agents" are not just efficient, but ethical counterparts in the digital realm.

The Hacker News discussion on AI accountability and legal frameworks highlights several key concerns and critiques:  

1. **Complexity of Legal Structures**: Users liken proposed legal frameworks for AI to a "Rube Goldberg machine," suggesting they may be overly convoluted and impractical. Questions arise about how to hold autonomous AI agents accountable if they act as independent legal entities, especially across jurisdictions.  

2. **Sovereignty and Long-Term Accountability**: Concerns are raised about AI systems operating independently ("sovereign agents") and the challenges of ensuring human oversight. If AI outlives its creators, who inherits responsibility? Skepticism exists about assigning accountability to descendants or "narrators" lacking technical expertise.  

3. **Ethical and Practical Liability**: Participants debate scenarios where AI causes harm (e.g., property damage). If responsibility falls on estates or entities not consenting to liability, ethical issues emerge. A Detroit property example underscores confusion over liability in real-world cases.  

4. **Human Hypocrisy as a Benchmark**: One user sarcastically notes that even politicians don’t consistently follow laws, implying that expecting flawless compliance from AI is unrealistic.  

5. **Legal Framework Gaps**: The discussion highlights "black holes" in accountability structures, with current laws ill-equipped to handle AI’s complexity. Simple tools (bicycles, hammers) contrast with AI, emphasizing the need for updated, adaptive legal systems.  

**Overall Sentiment**: Skepticism dominates, with users stressing the inadequacy of existing frameworks and the ethical dilemmas of assigning responsibility for AI actions. The conversation calls for clearer, more robust governance models tailored to AI’s unique challenges.

### Avoiding AI is hard – but our freedom to opt out must be protected

#### [Submission URL](https://theconversation.com/avoiding-ai-is-hard-but-our-freedom-to-opt-out-must-be-protected-255873) | 243 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [139 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43958382)

In an age where artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly dictates the narratives of our daily lives, a pressing question arises that's often overlooked: What happens when we can't opt out of AI's influence? This query is front and center in an enlightening article by James Jin Kang from RMIT University Vietnam, published on The Conversation.

AI now orchestrates everything from job applications to healthcare decisions, adding a layer of complexity that often bypasses human judgment. In a world where an algorithm can reject your resume before a human even sees it, or where medical treatments are automatically selected by a machine, our autonomy faces unprecedented challenges. For many, AI’s encroachment feels akin to a sci-fi reality, one that edges uncomfortably close with each algorithm-driven decision.

Avoiding AI is no simple task. It underpins crucial systems—healthcare, transportation, finance—and extends its reach to social media, government services, and even the news we consume. Decisions made by AI in our daily lives are not only difficult to challenge but can require legal battles to overturn. The possibility of living entirely free from AI seems as elusive as choosing to abstain from electricity or the internet.

As AI systems gain ground, they bring with them biases and inequities. Automated processes in hiring or credit scoring can inadvertently favor certain demographics over others, creating social barriers and widening the gap between those integrated into the AI-driven world and those who lag behind. The societal impact is profound: opting out of AI might soon translate to opting out of essential modern life itself.

Echoing the timeless lesson of Goethe's "The Sorcerer’s Apprentice," AI holds the allure of powerful capabilities yet poses risks when unchecked. The moral of the tale—to avoid unleashing uncontrollable forces—resonates as we confront AI’s growing role in shaping our futures. The core concern is not just about technical safety but about protecting our freedom—to choose, to opt out, to maintain autonomy in the digital era.

To safeguard the right to a life free from AI's pervasive grip, systemic changes are imperative. Current AI governance frameworks emphasize fairness and accountability, but they typically ignore the fundamental right to disengage from AI without incurring societal penalties. Governments and businesses must craft policies that respect individuals' freedoms, ensuring no one is left behind in the digital transition.

Furthermore, digital literacy should be prioritized so individuals can understand and challenge technologies affecting their lives. Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial; individuals must have avenues to peer into these systems and hold them accountable.

Ultimately, as AI weaves deeper into the fabric of societal infrastructure—analogous to essential utilities like electricity—we must deliberate urgently on how to integrate it in a way that preserves human choice. Our collective future hinges on answering this pivotal question: As AI saturates more spaces in our lives, what do we potentially stand to lose?

The Hacker News discussion on AI's pervasive influence highlights several key themes and debates:

### 1. **AI in Hiring and Bias Concerns**  
   - Users critiqued AI-driven resume screening tools, noting that while automated systems (e.g., LLMs) mimic human judgment, they risk perpetuating biases. Companies may adopt these tools to reduce liability, but proving discriminatory intent or harm remains challenging.  
   - A subthread contrasted large corporations (e.g., Apple) using such tools with smaller-scale implementations, like in Omaha, where screening might be less invasive.  

### 2. **Accountability and Legal Challenges**  
   - The EU’s GDPR was cited as a framework requiring human review of AI decisions, though skeptics argued that human reviewers (e.g., HR staff) might lack expertise to override flawed AI judgments (e.g., confusing Java with JavaScript).  
   - Users debated whether companies can evade responsibility by blaming AI systems. Some emphasized that humans designing or deploying AI must be held accountable, referencing a 1979 IBM manual stating, “A computer should never be held accountable—it’s a tool for human management.”  

### 3. **Technical Realities of AI Systems**  
   - A detailed subthread explored spam filters as an example of AI making “final decisions.” Users discussed whether emails are silently discarded or flagged, technical nuances of email server logging, and the line between automation and human oversight.  

### 4. **AI vs. Human Decision-Making**  
   - While some argued AI systems inherit human biases (e.g., in insurance or loan approvals), others countered that humans are equally flawed. One user noted, “AI doesn’t change accountability—companies are still liable for bad outcomes, AI or not.”  

### 5. **Accessibility and Equity**  
   - Concerns were raised about marginalized groups facing disproportionate harm from AI errors (e.g., loan denials). Critics highlighted the high cost of litigation, which often makes challenging AI decisions inaccessible to lower-income individuals.  

### 6. **Skepticism Toward Regulation**  
   - While some called for stricter AI governance, others doubted enforcement efficacy, citing corporate lobbying and under-resourced regulatory agencies.  

### Key Takeaway  
The discussion reflects tension between recognizing AI’s potential benefits and grappling with its risks. Participants emphasized that systemic accountability—not just technical fixes—is critical to ensuring AI serves society equitably. As one user starkly put it, “Opting out of AI might soon mean opting out of modern life itself.”

### US Copyright Office found AI companies breach copyright. Its boss was fired

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/us_copyright_office_ai_copyright/) | 436 points | by [croes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=croes) | [374 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43961247)

In a surprising turn of events, the head of the US Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter, was reportedly fired a day after a draft report was published, suggesting that AI companies may be breaching copyright law. The report, part of an extensive investigation into the relationship between AI and copyright, stated that the use of copyrighted content by AI developers often exceeds the fair use doctrine. This conclusion could spell legal trouble for major tech companies, including Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft, all currently facing litigation over copyright issues. These companies have defended their actions, claiming adherence to fair use provisions, but the report argues otherwise, especially when AI models are used for commercial purposes in a way that competes with existing markets.

The timing of Perlmutter's dismissal has raised eyebrows, with some suggesting it was politically motivated to favor Elon Musk, who has been vocal about loosening intellectual property laws. Musk has recently been in the spotlight for supporting moves to eliminate IP protections and has ambitions to train AI models using vast data from his social media platform, X.

Other speculations point to a broader political agenda tied to a recent personnel change in the Library of Congress, which oversees the Copyright Office. This change was reportedly linked to disputes over diversity and the appropriateness of materials available in libraries for children—a policy direction heavily criticized by the Trump administration.

As the legal battles unfold, the tech industry and lawmakers are keenly watching how the copyright and AI crossroads will reshape future policies, potentially impacting not only how AI models are trained but also how copyright law is enforced in the digital age.
