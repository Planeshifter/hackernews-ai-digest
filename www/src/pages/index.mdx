The warrant allowed the FBI to search and seize information from any computer it sent its software to. It is unclear how the FBI determined which computers were infected, as the warrant seems to authorize an intrusion into all accessible computers. The only limitation mentioned in the warrant is that it does not authorize the seizure of any tangible property or alteration of functionality. This operation raises questions about the extent to which the government can coerce content moderation decisions and the means by which it can do so.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the recent operation conducted by the FBI to take down the Qakbot botnet. Users express concerns about the potential invasion of privacy and abuse of power that could result from the FBI remotely installing software on over 700,000 computers without notifying the victims. Some users argue that the FBI should have disclosed the existence of any 0-day vulnerabilities used in the operation, while others highlight the need for effective law enforcement. There is also a debate about the legality and oversight of such operations, with one user questioning if foreign intelligence agencies are acting illegally domestically. Another user raises concerns about the compromised computers becoming part of a shady hacker collective. Some users discuss the FBI's preference for Linux systems over Windows, and there is a general sentiment of fear and distrust towards the power and secrecy of federal agencies.

### Microsoft has not stopped forcing Edge on Windows 11 users

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ctrl.blog/entry/windows-system-components-default-edge.html) | 733 points | by [extr0pian](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=extr0pian) | [436 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37461449)

The recent blog post from Microsoft announcing that Windows system components would start respecting the default web browser setting has caused confusion among users. While many in the tech media celebrated this as a win for users, Daniel Aleksandersen, who developed the open-source EdgeDeflector program, has conducted extensive testing and found no changes in the new Windows Insider version. Despite the highlight in the changelog suggesting that Microsoft had caved to pressure from the European Union, Aleksandersen's findings indicate that Windows 11 still strongly discourages changing the default browser away from Microsoft Edge. Web links continue to force-open in Microsoft Edge rather than the user's default browser. Microsoft has not publicly clarified the changes or responded to requests for comment, leading to speculation that the assumed changes may be a gradual rollout. Despite the lack of confirmation, the story has received significant positive press attention.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around several different topics. 

One user highlights the surprise and confusion regarding the recent changes to Windows system components respecting the default web browser setting. They mention Paul Thurrott's article about the issue and speculate that the changes may not have been fully implemented in the new Windows Insider version.
Another user brings up the past instances of Microsoft's behavior regarding default browser settings, mentioning cases from Windows 7 and Windows 98. They argue that Microsoft's actions have previously been driven by non-competitive behavior.
There is a discussion about the reluctance of governments to regulate non-competitive behavior in the tech industry, with one user specifically mentioning the EU's regulations and another user referring to the military-industrial complex in the US.
Some users express frustration with Microsoft and their integration of certain products, mentioning forced installations and the lack of options to disable or switch to alternatives.
The conversation then shifts to a broader discussion about the influence of big business and the manipulation of public discourse. There are also mentions of the catch-22 situation of criticism against billionaires and the difficulty of confronting those with power and influence.
There is a brief discussion about the EU's willingness to regulate non-competitive behavior and the need for laws that promote competition and benefit consumers.
One user expresses dissatisfaction with Microsoft's practices, stating that they find it inconvenient to be forced to use certain products, while another user argues that the integration of certain software can have practical benefits.
The discussion then touches on the topic of tightly integrated software and its pros and cons. Examples are given of various platforms and their level of integration, with some users arguing that tightly integrated software can be beneficial, while others argue that it can be messy and limiting.
The conversation ends with a user discussing the need for controls on integrations and the potential issues that can arise from undocumented APIs and non-competitive practices.
