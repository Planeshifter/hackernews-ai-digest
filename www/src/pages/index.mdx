### Why transformative artificial intelligence is hard to achieve

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) | 79 points | by [hunglee2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hunglee2) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36934032)

Transformative artificial intelligence (AI) has been talked about as the next major technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the world. But according to a recent essay, achieving this level of AI is actually extremely difficult. The article highlights several challenges that stand in the way of transformative AI.

One of the main challenges is the complexity of AI itself. AI systems would need to be as good as or better than humans at all economically valuable tasks in order to be truly transformative. However, measuring AI's performance on predetermined tasks is risky, as there may be tasks we're not even aware of that are necessary for real-world impact. The essay defines transformative AI in terms of its observed economic impact, specifically looking at productivity growth.

Another challenge is the potential imbalance in productivity growth. Even if AI progresses rapidly in certain areas, there may still be major technical hurdles to overcome in other areas. And even if AI can automate many tasks, it may not be able to automate all tasks, leaving certain sectors relatively more valuable and limiting the overall impact on the economy. This has been observed in the past, where productivity growth has been uneven across sectors, leading to slower overall growth.

Furthermore, the production of ideas itself has bottlenecks that are difficult to overcome. Automating certain tasks may have different effects on growth compared to automating all tasks. Some steps in the innovation process may be essential but hard to improve, leading to constraints on explosive growth.

Overall, the essay suggests that while AI has the potential to be transformative, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed. It's important to temper expectations and recognize the complexities and limitations of achieving transformative AI.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to transformative AI. Some users question whether AI can truly make significant contributions to society, particularly in the realm of mathematics, while others argue that AI has the potential to generate novel mathematical proofs. There is also a discussion about the limitations of current AI models, such as their lack of true understanding and the need for more diverse training data. The topic of intelligence and the definition of intelligence in AI systems is also touched upon.

### Oops Google Did It Again

#### [Submission URL](https://dombytes.com/post/oops-google-did-it-again/) | 69 points | by [bezout](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bezout) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36921634)

In a recent Hacker News submission titled "The Web Environment Integrity Proposal: A Good Idea or Recipe for Anti-Competitive Practices?" the author discusses Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal. The proposal suggests creating a Web API that allows websites to assess the trustworthiness of a client device before delivering content. While this concept has been implemented by Apple with their Private Access Tokens (PATs), the concern lies in Google's market dominance through Chrome (popular web browser) and Android (leading mobile operating system). If Google were to control the attesters, it could create an anti-competitive environment, making it difficult for new OSes, device vendors, and web browsers to gain access to this functionality. The best case scenario is that Google handles this power responsibly, leading to a more secure and efficient web experience without CAPTCHAs and fake engagement. However, the worst case scenario could result in a walled garden where Google controls which devices are deemed trustworthy, stifling innovation and reinforcing planned obsolescence. The submission suggests that while we allowed Google to attain its current monopoly, it is crucial to consider whether a CAPTCHA-free, bot-less web is worth the potential consequences.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the potential consequences and concerns of Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal.

- One user points out that the sentence "doesn't consider the worst-case scenario," stating that Silicon Valley has become accustomed to summarizing wrong tech trends over the past 15+ years.
- Another user brings up the disadvantages of DRM, mentioning that if John Deere's tractor maintenance can be considered a distressing example, it highlights the negative aspects of DRM.
- One commenter expresses concern about the potential for attestation in today's web becoming the foundation for tomorrow's web, with the majority supporting this concept. They note that the WEI proposal acknowledges the risk of centralizing testing, and suggests that browsers could handle testing themselves, allowing market share to determine testing standards instead.
- Another user wonders if web crawlers aren't controlled by Google, as they might be unable to access valid tokens.
- Someone argues that computer scientists' worst-case scenario allows for the risk of false complaints about WEI and Private Access Tokens (PATs), but Google's dominant position with Chrome and Android could lead to non-competitive practices. They also mention that WEI and PATs are not necessarily directly harmful, but they question their non-competitive purposes.
- In response, another user highlights that attestation can be incentivizing for particular website owners and non-incentivizing for those that offer a decent user experience without being attested. They claim that Apple's PATs cannot make the web standard, but Google successfully pushed it by making it the default. They also mention that PATs are compatible on the web, while WEI is not.
- Another user adds that the transformation is happening, as the majority of services and systems capable of attestation are sleeping in a slippery slope world where content and commercial activity are largely pulled towards the most popular browser again. They also note that other browser makers are gradually adhering to this trend.
- One user mentions a related post that discusses the combined impact of WEI and Safari on market share, indicating that Safari has a significant market share.
- A reply to that comment further breaks down submarket share, pointing out that iOS is a safer system by forgetting it.

Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the potential anti-competitive practices associated with Google's WEI proposal, as well as the implications of centralized testing and attestation control. Some users express skepticism about the motivations behind WEI and the potential consequences for the web ecosystem.

### Absolute Unit NNs: Regression-Based MLPs for Everything

#### [Submission URL](https://gwern.net/aunn) | 16 points | by [nirvael](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nirvael) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36891609)

A proposal has been put forward for a general neural network (NN) architecture that can handle arbitrary tasks and scale up MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons). The architecture, called Absolute Unit NN (AUNN), aims to enable meta-learning prediction of arbitrary data inputs and outputs. The training data is encoded into a list, and the NN is trained to predict from the one-dimensional unit input of the absolute index of a data point to that data point unit. This allows the NN to generalize and rapidly learn new datapoints in a single gradient descent step. The AUNN architecture has several advantages, including simplicity, minimal inductive bias, generality of input/output, and hardware-friendliness. It also has potential applications in language-conditioned AUNNs and modular brain AUNNs. However, one disadvantage is that it may require a large scale of data and compute before it can effectively generalize and meta-learn. The proposal draws inspiration from various existing NN architectures and methodologies, such as self-supervised Transformers, neural radiance fields, and meta-reinforcement learning. The goal is to extend the capabilities of MLPs to handle diverse input/output modalities without the need for complex and computationally expensive dense layers.

In the discussion on Hacker News, there were a couple of comments. One commenter mentioned that this proposal reminded them of non-verbal reasoning and index learning, providing a link to a related article. Another commenter expressed their enthusiasm for the proposal and described it as amazing, also sharing a link to a GitHub repository. In response to this comment, another user suggested that they are working on a similar project using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and mentioned that implementing it should not be too difficult.

### Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08621) | 101 points | by [sangel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sangel) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36831956)

Researchers from various institutions have proposed a new architecture called the Retentive Network (RetNet) as a successor to the popular Transformer model for large language models. This architecture aims to achieve training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance simultaneously. The key innovation in RetNet is the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms: parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. These paradigms allow for efficient training, low-cost inference, and linear complexity in modeling long sequences. Experimental results on language modeling demonstrate that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The proposed architecture shows promise as a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code for RetNet will be made available for further research and development.

### Stable Diffusion and ControlNet: “Hidden” Text (see thumbnail vs. full image)

#### [Submission URL](https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/1561k15/free_tool_to_generate_hidden_text_using_stable/) | 98 points | by [b0ner_t0ner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=b0ner_t0ner) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36832271)

BoostPixels, a Reddit user, has created a fascinating tool that uses Stable Diffusion and ControlNet to generate hidden text in images. The tool works in a unique way – when the image is small, the text stands out clearly. However, as the image enlarges, decoding the text becomes a challenging task. This curious phenomena has captured the attention of many users who have tried to decipher the hidden messages. Some strategies, such as squinting, blinking rapidly, or scrolling the image, seem to help make the text more visible. While it's an interesting experiment, /u/BoostPixels hopes that this tool won't be used for evil purposes.

The discussion on the submission starts with GaggiX acknowledging the use of the ControlNet model by the OP, BoostPixels. They share a link to an installation guide for the ControlNet model and mention that previous methods of generating QR codes didn't produce high-quality messages. There is then a conversation about AI generating QR codes and patterns similar to natural ones, with LanternLight83 wondering if complex text content can be sorted by the complexity of the ControlNet Local Linear Models (LLMs).
 
ben_w points out that generating text visually is difficult for short words with no distinctive landmarks, but GaggiX argues that ASCII art limits the expressiveness of sentences. cpblwb offers a poetic interpretation of the hidden text. gdlsk joins the discussion, expressing praise for the comments on Reddit and acknowledging the community's collective understanding of the tool's implementation.

The conversation then delves into the different user experiences when viewing the hidden text. Some discuss how the text becomes more visible when zoomed or viewed on a mobile phone, while others mention difficulties in spotting the text unless they hold their phone at a specific angle. There is also discussion about the visibility of the text on different screens, with some users mentioning that enlarging the image on a high-resolution monitor makes the text disappear while others find it readable. 

The link in the submission is mentioned by ch, who confirms that the stable diffusion method works on a MacBook Pro M1 Max. tmm shares a similar illusion they made in 2014 that involves thumbnail squinting. strng comments on the exploitability of resizing algorithms, mentioning that Photoshop filters can produce misleading results. tlstptml and hpfnsprgrj offer explanations related to human contrast sensitivity and letter squinting, respectively. 

The discussion then transitions to the nature of incorrect algorithms in resizing and how they affect the visibility of objects. Some users mention experiences with resizing algorithms and high-resolution monitors, while others question the impact of content contrast and spatial patterns. pngr argues that different spatial patterns will have a well-defined and substantially compressible space. 

lcbrtry finds the effect fascinating and shares personal experience with squinting to see hidden text. mnstmnsmn comments on the inability to see the hidden text on their iPhone 14 Pro Max. smblt issues a PSA about blurred vision affecting the effectiveness of the effect, and ChatGTP mentions an off-topic issue with a broken back button on the page. wmtt tries to provide a solution for viewing the hidden text on an iPhone, while munch117 suggests that the link to the desktop version may work better for iPhone users.

### Apple is already using its chatbot for internal work
