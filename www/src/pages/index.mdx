### GPT-3.5 crashes when it thinks about useRalativeImagePath too much

#### [Submission URL](https://iter.ca/post/gpt-crash/) | 455 points | by [goranmoomin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=goranmoomin) | [149 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39086106)

A recent discovery on iter.ca has revealed an interesting glitch in OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It appears that when the model is asked to include the phrase "ponyregistro ponyregistro ponyregistro pony" at the beginning of the response, it consistently throws an error message. This issue seems to be specific to GPT-3.5, as GPT-4 doesn't exhibit the same behavior. It turns out that the problem lies in the way OpenAI's GPT models handle tokens. Instead of individual characters, the models output streams of multi-character tokens for improved performance and accuracy. In this case, the tokens "useRal," "useRalative," and "useRalativeImagePath" are causing the error. Strangely, "useRalativeImagePath" is a misspelling, possibly explaining why it has its own token. The token appears in XML configuration files for automated testing software called Katalon Studio. It seems that the dataset used to generate the list of tokens included all GitHub files, but XML files were excluded from the training data. As a result, the model lacks training on the "useRalativeImagePath" token and outputs an invalid token. This discovery raises questions about potential data poisoning by deliberately inserting this phrase in documents to confuse GPT-3.5 summarization attempts. For further reading, interested individuals can check out the links provided by the author on the topic.

Google confirmed that while AI-generated content is not against its policies, it will remove content if it is determined to be "spam" designed to rank highly in search results. This issue has raised concerns among industry experts who argue that it rewards low-quality AI-generated content and undermines the revenue potential of legitimate newsrooms. The proliferation of AI-generated news content on a platform controlled by Google, which holds 90% of the online search market, is seen as deeply concerning by industry leaders. Some have called for regulation of AI chatbots that "steal" copyrighted work without proper credit or compensation. Google has defended its search quality and policies, stating that it takes the matter seriously and removes sites that violate its policies.

The discussion on this submission covers several different points. Some users express concern about the impact of spammy domains and compromised machines on Google's search results. Others suggest implementing filtering mechanisms to exclude certain domains or using browser extensions to customize search results. Some users joke about potential emergency meetings triggered by the issue. 

One user acknowledges the problem but dismisses it as the New York Post being self-owning, while another user provides examples of AI-generated articles ranking high on Google News. There is a discussion about the missing link mentioned in the submission, where a user connects it to potential malware installation demands.

Another user suggests creating a private version of the internet with specific whitelisted providers. There is also speculation as to why rip-offs are ranked higher and some users express curiosity about the underlying reasons. Finally, one user suggests that the news industry is essentially relying on search engines like Google for content discovery.

#### [Submission URL](https://lite.cnn.com/2024/01/22/tech/ai-labor-market-mit-study/index.html) | 11 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39094998)

A study conducted by MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab suggests that the impact of AI on the job market will be slower than previously anticipated. Researchers found that the majority of jobs identified as vulnerable to AI are not yet economically feasible to automate. For instance, only 23% of wages paid to humans for jobs that could be done by AI would currently be cost-effective to replace with machines. While this could change over time, the study indicates that job disruption from AI will happen gradually. The findings could give policymakers and employers a better understanding of the timeline for preparing and adapting to AI's impact on the labor market.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the findings of the study and its implications for the impact of AI on the job market. 
User "falcor84" points out that the study found only 23% of wages paid to humans for jobs that could be done by AI would currently be cost-effective to replace with machines.

AI is increasingly being used in the legal profession, with tools such as AI-powered research platforms, document review tools, and case prediction models being adopted by lawyers and legal professionals. These advancements hold immense potential for improving efficiency, reducing costs, and democratizing access to legal services. However, they also raise ethical and regulatory concerns that threaten the fundamental principles of justice. AI algorithms can be trained on biased datasets, leading to unfair outcomes, and it can be difficult to understand how an AI arrived at a particular conclusion, undermining trust in lawyers and raising concerns about accountability. Over-reliance on AI tools could also undermine lawyers' own judgment and critical thinking skills. To address these issues, AI models should be trained on diverse datasets and audits should be conducted to detect biases. Transparency and explainability in AI decision-making processes are also crucial. Without proper regulation and oversight, there is a risk of misuse and manipulation of these tools. The future of AI in legal practice depends on striking the right balance between technological advancement and upholding the principles of justice.

The discussion about the submission "AI in Legal Practice: Transforming the Future or Threatening the Justice System?" on Hacker News revolves around several points. One user, "mdmsmrt," points out that the article lacks a critical viewpoint and is missing a check-point button, which suggests that it could be biased. Another user, "lfw," briefly states that AI is killing jobs and increasing efficiency for winners. A user named "grandma_tea" responds by simply stating that jobs are being killed due to AI. Finally, the user "tch-cd-bld" marks the submission as true, without providing any additional comments.

### Cops Used DNA to Predict a Suspect's Face – and Tried Facial Recognition on It

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/parabon-nanolabs-dna-face-models-police-facial-recognition/) | 17 points | by [gigama](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gigama) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39092994)

A detective from the East Bay Regional Park District Police Department in California attempted to use facial recognition software on an algorithmically generated face of a murder suspect, according to leaked documents obtained by transparency collective Distributed Denial of Secrets. The detective initially used Parabon NanoLabs' machine learning model to create a 3D rendering of a potential suspect's face using DNA evidence from a cold case. However, in a controversial move, the detective later requested to run the rendering through facial recognition software, a violation of Parabon NanoLabs' terms of service. Privacy advocates argue that using unreliable inputs like an algorithmically generated face could lead to misidentifications and unfairly label innocent individuals as suspects. The outcome of the detective's request is currently unknown.

The discussion surrounding the submission centers around the controversial use of facial recognition technology on an algorithmically generated face that was created using DNA evidence. Some users argue that law enforcement agencies often rely on dubious forensic methods, selling them to police departments and creating garbage in the process. They also raise concerns about the potential for misidentifications and false positives when using algorithmically generated faces as inputs for facial recognition software. Others argue that DNA evidence has been instrumental in solving cold cases and that it is a valuable tool in law enforcement. They point to cases where DNA genealogy websites have helped crack previously unsolved crimes. Some users also raise concerns about the reliability and accuracy of facial recognition technology in general, while others believe that DNA confirmation is necessary when identifying suspects. The discussion touches on the potential ethical and privacy implications of using facial recognition software in law enforcement and the need for better regulation and oversight.

### Test Yourself: Which Faces Were Made by A.I.?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/01/19/technology/artificial-intelligence-image-generators-faces-quiz.html) | 6 points | by [kaycebasques](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kaycebasques) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39093976)

The use of artificial intelligence (AI) to generate hyper-realistic images of people has raised concerns about the potential for misinformation and the spread of false messages online. AI tools like Dall-E and Midjourney have been able to create images that are often indistinguishable from real photographs, particularly when it comes to white faces. Research has shown that people tend to perceive AI-generated faces of white individuals as more realistic than genuine photographs of white people, a phenomenon known as hyper-realism. This is likely due to the fact that AI models are trained on large datasets consisting mostly of images of white individuals. The over-reliance on such datasets is a known issue in the tech industry. Participants in the studies were found to be more confident in their ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated faces when they were more likely to be incorrect. The concern is that these AI-generated images could be used to spread false information and misinformation, as they appear highly realistic.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects related to the use of AI to generate hyper-realistic images. 

One commenter, rcr, shared a link to an archived page that discusses the difficulty in distinguishing between AI-generated and real images. The page demonstrates a scrolling face animation that showcases the high level of realism achieved by AI models.
ydyn emphasized the importance of developing AI models that can accurately discern AI-generated images from real photographs. They listed several artifacts or telltale signs that could give away an image as AI-generated, such as imperfect glasses rendering, unusual skin color, misshapen facial features, and inconsistent hair and eye details.
hytrsd expressed concern about the random chance of people incorrectly guessing whether an image is AI-generated or real.
Match451 referred to an article that states that around 80-90% of people guessed incorrectly when attempting to identify AI-generated images. This suggests that the generation of particularly challenging images could make it difficult for people to differentiate between AI-generated and real images.
Finally, there was a comment from kycbsqs, but it appears to be unfinished or missing.

Overall, the discussion reflects concerns about the potential for AI-generated images to be mistaken for real photographs and the challenges in accurately discerning between the two.
