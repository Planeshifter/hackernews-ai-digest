In an engaging exploration of the intersection between creativity and automation, a blogger recounts a recent conversation with a friend who seems determined to replace him with AI-generated content. As they discuss the potential future of human intellectual work, the blogger grapples with the implications of AI effectively mimicking his writing style after only a few examples. He contrasts this with traditional sci-fi portrayals of robots, noting that today’s AI is adept at emulating form but often misses the mark on substance, leading to a darker tone in its outputs.

The blogger reflects on the nuances of personality and creativity, suggesting that perhaps his own writing is a collage of influences rather than an original voice. He humorously critiques the AI's attempts to capture his style, revealing its bleak outlook and flat humor—often delving into grim historical anecdotes rather than positive reflections.

This exploration serves as a thought-provoking reminder of the complexities of human expression in an age increasingly dominated by artificial intelligence, hinting at a future where the unique blend of creativity and factual accuracy may be a precious human advantage over automated counterparts.

The discussion surrounding the blogger's submission on Hacker News dives into the themes of automation and creativity, particularly in relation to job replacement by AI. Users express concern over the potential for automation to displace human jobs, particularly in creative fields. 

Some commenters ponder the limits of human creativity in comparison to AI's capabilities, noting that while AI can replicate styles, it often lacks depth and nuanced understanding. This prompts a debate about the inherent value of human expression and whether it can be effectively imitated by machines. 

There's also a consideration of societal factors related to automation, with mentions of Scandinavian systems and citizenship rights, implying a mixed bag of outcomes when it comes to automation and job security. Overall, the conversation reflects a mixture of apprehension and curiosity about the future of creative professions in an increasingly automated world, reinforcing the notion that while AI can assist, the unique qualities of human creativity still hold significant value.

### US and UK sign legally enforceable AI treaty

### Canva says its new AI features justify raising subscription prices by 300%

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2024/09/03/canva-hiking-teams-subscription-prices-ai-features/) | 29 points | by [doener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41446598)

Canva is making headlines with its decision to boost subscription prices for its "Teams" service by up to 300%, marking the first significant increase since 2020. The popular design platform, known for its user-friendly interface, attributes this steep price hike to the introduction of advanced AI-powered features, particularly its new Magic Studio—a comprehensive toolset for generating images, videos, and more.

As of early December, U.S. users will see their Teams subscription soar from $119.99 per year to $500, with a temporary discount of $300 for the first year. While Canva claims these changes are necessary for enhancing team collaboration and streamlining design processes, many users are expressing concern that the price jump could alienate smaller teams that have contributed to Canva's success through grassroots advocacy.

Some users, however, see the increased cost as justifiable given the platform's expanded capabilities. As the debate continues, Canva maintains that its Pro plans remain unchanged, keeping the platform accessible for those not requiring team-based features. With ongoing talks surrounding a potential IPO, Canva's future pricing and product evolution remain on the minds of both avid fans and critics alike.

The discussion surrounding Canva's steep price increase for its "Teams" subscription has revealed a mix of opinions among users. Some participants express skepticism about the sustainability of subscription models, citing concerns that the high cost, which is increasing by up to 300%, could alienate smaller teams that are crucial to Canva's grassroots support. Others argue that the addition of advanced features, particularly AI capabilities, justifies the price hike. 

Several commenters point out the disconnect between subscription pricing and the value delivered, emphasizing that while some tools may offer innovative features, the financial burden could limit access for users who rely on affordable solutions. There's also a broader discourse on trends within the tech industry, with some suggesting that many companies, similar to Canva, are testing the limits of user tolerance for pricing changes in light of new technologies.

Additional comments reflect on past experiences with subscription services, with users sharing sentiments about the viability of such models. The general consensus seems to indicate a need for careful consideration of user needs and market dynamics as companies evolve their pricing strategies.
