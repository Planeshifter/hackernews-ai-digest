### SymbolicAI: A neuro-symbolic perspective on LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai) | 202 points | by [futurisold](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=futurisold) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44399234)

On today's Hacker News, we're spotlighting an exciting new library making waves in the programming community: SymbolicAI by ExtensityAI. This project offers a neuro-symbolic framework that marries the rigor of classical Python programming with the flexibility of Large Language Models (LLMs), all wrapped in a compositional differentiable programming library. It's no wonder the project has garnered 1.3k stars and 63 forks on GitHub! 

SymbolicAI aims to streamline the use of LLMs by introducing two key concepts: 'primitives' and 'contracts'. The heart of the library lies in 'Symbol' objects that can operate in dual modes—syntactic and semantic. The former treats data as traditional Python values, ensuring safety and speed, while the latter taps into the LLM’s depth, allowing for semantic understanding and context-aware operations. This duality facilitates a seamless weave of operations for developers seeking both precision and functionality in handling data.

The use of 'contracts' within SymbolicAI is particularly innovative. Drawing inspiration from Design by Contract principles, these contracts bolster code reliability by embedding correctness directly into design through decorators. This proactive approach can significantly reduce the reliance on post-hoc testing and ensure robust application logic.

With SymbolicAI, developers can harness modular, extensible tools to easily integrate web searches, image generation, and more. It sets a remarkable example of how to make complex LLM interactions feel natural in Python, opening doors for broader adoption and experimentation in AI-driven projects. If you're a developer interested in expanding the capabilities of your applications with neuro-symbolic programming, SymbolicAI might just be worth exploring.

Solutions proposed include **grammar-based constraints** (e.g., JSON schema validation) and leveraging SymbolicAI’s contracts for post-hoc validation.

2. **Contracts & Functional Equivalence**:  
   - The `contracts` concept sparked interest, with users likening them to **design-by-contract principles**. A key insight: contracts ensure LLM outputs meet functional specifications, enabling "equivalence" even if implementations vary. This abstraction could allow swapping LLMs without breaking systems.  
   - One user shared a project using contracts for document generation ([example PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Va7ALq_N-fTYeumKhH4jSxsTrWD)), emphasizing their role in validation and system reliability.

3. **Integration with Existing Tools**:  
   - Commenters discussed integrating SymbolicAI with relational data tools (SQL, Splunk), notebooks, and dashboards. A "semantic dataframe" extension was proposed, blending symbolic logic with tabular data operations.  
   - Comparisons to **neuro-symbolic systems** (e.g., Type 3 architectures) highlighted SymbolicAI’s potential to unify neural flexibility with symbolic rigor.

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Philosophical debates emerged around semantics vs. syntax, referencing Peirce’s semiotics and Montague semantics. Users noted SymbolicAI’s alignment with classical symbolic AI but stressed the need for deeper integration with neural components.  
   - Practical critiques included code corrections (e.g., fixing `valid_sizes` in examples) and calls for clearer documentation.

5. **Community Contributions**:  
   - Links to [example notebooks](https://github.com/ExtensityAI/symbolicai/blob/main/examples) and a [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.00854) were shared, showcasing SymbolicAI’s versatility in tasks like logical inference and data transformation.

**Takeaway**: SymbolicAI is seen as a promising bridge between classical programming and LLM-driven workflows, but its success hinges on addressing LLM non-determinism, expanding integrations, and fostering community-driven use cases. The discussion reflects optimism tempered with pragmatic technical scrutiny.

### Show HN: PILF, The ultimate solution to catastrophic oblivion on AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/dmf-archive/PILF) | 28 points | by [NetRunnerSu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=NetRunnerSu) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44395810)

Hacker News is abuzz today with a fascinating dive into the world of adaptive learning frameworks, thanks to the open-source project PILF (Predictive Integrity Learning Framework) hosted on GitHub. This innovative framework, inspired by Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT), aims to revolutionize the way models handle training by mitigating the effects of catastrophic forgetting and enhancing efficiency through a Surprise-gated Mixture of Experts (MoE) model.

At its core, PILF shifts from traditional fixed hyperparameters to dynamic strategies, driven by the "Surprise" of data encountered during training. The framework leverages this concept in several novel ways:

1. **Dynamic Learning Rate:** Unlike static approaches, PILF adjusts the learning rate in real-time based on the Surprise metric, which evaluates the novelty or importance of data. Moderate Surprise results in boosting the learning rate, while too low or too high Surprise sees it nearing zero, effectively ignoring or rejecting inadequate data. This challenges the traditional manually-set learning rate schedulers by allowing the system to "learn" how much to learn dynamically.

2. **Dynamic Capacity Usage:** Within the MoE architecture, the Surprise metric also dictates the number of "experts" activated for a given task. Simple tasks engage fewer experts, while complex tasks necessitate a dynamic enlistment of more, replacing fixed Top-K routing.

The development of PILF is broken down into evolutionary stages, each refining the adaptive capability further. Among those stages is the PILR-S (Predictive Integrity Learning Rate Scheduler), which introduces a sophisticated approach to learning rate adjustment, moving from binary gating logic to smooth continuous modulation.

The PILR-S module operates using a computational toolkit, SigmaPI, to calculate the learning value without waiting for heavy backpropagation processes, enabling a speedy assessment of data worthiness and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

The initiative is open for exploration on GitHub, where the community can examine the project's code, contribute, and witness the progress of adaptive learning frameworks firsthand. Whether you're a seasoned ML engineer or a newcomer, PILF offers a compelling glimpse into the future of smarter, more efficient AI training methodologies.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around PILF explores both enthusiasm and skepticism, focusing on technical nuances and philosophical parallels with human cognition:

1. **Skepticism & Validation:**  
   - Initial comments caution against potential "LARPing" (inauthentic claims), urging scrutiny. Advocates defend PILF’s scientific rigor, emphasizing its basis in Integrated Predictive Workspace Theory (IPWT) and empirical precision.

2. **Model Stability Concerns:**  
   - Questions arise about whether the "Surprise" metric—steering learning rate adjustments—might destabilize models. Concerns include abrupt changes in gradients or hyperparameters leading to rigidity. A rebuttal likens PILR-S’s learning rate modulation to human psychology: avoiding extreme "surprises" (analogous to trauma) while balancing stability and plasticity.

3. **Cognitive Metaphors:**  
   - Deeper debate compares the framework to human cognition. Critics highlight risks of models becoming dogmatic, mirroring human cognitive rigidity when faced with contradictory data. Proponents counter that hyperparameters like `sigma_threshold` can tune "open-mindedness," balancing skepticism (conservative learning) vs. adaptability (accepting paradigm shifts).

4. **Hyperparameter Dynamics:**  
   - The shift from manual hyperparameter tuning to PILF’s dynamic approach is praised as a breakthrough, though some humorously lament the end of "parameter fiddling." The method is framed as a step toward meta-learning, where models self-optimize strategies over time.

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   - The discussion acknowledges PILF’s potential to bridge machine learning with cognitive science, particularly in understanding intelligence and consciousness through adaptive architectures.

In essence, the conversation balances technical critique with admiration for PILF’s ambition, underscoring challenges in aligning AI adaptability with human-like learning while avoiding pitfalls like instability or rigidity.

   - Comparisons are drawn to past overhyped technologies, referencing the **Gartner Hype Cycle** and Salesforce’s stock price being inflated by AI buzz.

2. **Critiques of Salesforce’s Products**:  
   - Salesforce’s CRM is criticized as outdated, likened to "Microsoft Access for the web," with users highlighting frustrations over customization and usability. Competitors like HubSpot and Zoho are seen as more innovative.  
   - The new "Agentforce" AI product is met with skepticism, seen as part of a trend of rebranding rather than genuine innovation.

3. **Job Displacement and Labor Practices**:  
   - Layoffs are framed as part of a broader shift toward prioritizing AI over human labor, with anecdotes about 1990s-era job cuts resurfacing. Critics argue companies exploit the "Puritan work ethic" to justify reducing wages and headcount.  
   - Concerns about **AI’s impact on employment** are tempered by debates over whether AI truly replaces jobs or merely shifts roles, with some noting humans remain essential for complex tasks (e.g., interviews, strategic decisions).

4. **Broader Economic and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Users highlight corporate short-termism, with management prioritizing cost-cutting over workforce quality. Others call for new organizational structures to protect workers in an AI-driven economy.  
   - A subthread critiques the suppression of wages and the need for policy interventions to address AI’s societal impact.

5. **Miscellaneous Reactions**:  
   - Jokes about AI generating code comments (e.g., "46% of comments") and Bitcoin references add levity, while security concerns and artistic implications of AI are briefly mentioned.

### Starcloud can’t put a data centre in space at $8.2M in one Starship

#### [Submission URL](https://angadh.com/space-data-centers-1) | 151 points | by [angadh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=angadh) | [247 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44390781)

The audacious idea of placing data centers in space might sound like science fiction, but Starcloud Inc. is making headlines with its claims of creating such facilities using just one SpaceX Starship launch. However, a recent technoeconomic analysis suggests that this ambitious plan is groundless under the given financial and logistical constraints. The analysis argues that Starcloud's proposal to build a 40 MW space data center (SDC) for $8.2 million using a single Starship launch is highly unrealistic.

Starcloud draws on the allure of virtually limitless solar energy and the absence of atmospheric hindrances to make space data centers appealing. However, the reality appears more complicated. The evaluation of the claim indicates that constructing such an SDC would actually involve up to 22 Starship launches – far exceeding one launch. For instance, it would need four launches to install the necessary solar arrays, 13 for the thermal management system, and another five just for the server racks. 

Beyond logistical feasibilities, the presumed low launch costs cited by Starcloud are severely undercut from reality. Though they claim a cost of $30/kg for space launches, experts suggest a more realistic launch cost might be close to $1000/kg, raising the overall expense of this venture astronomically to around $103.2 million rather than $8.2 million. This discrepancy in figures starkly contrasts with the lower launch costs quoted by Starcloud, with even the most optimistic $500/kg pricing scenario resulting in costs upwards of $53.2 million.

The analysis lays out the considerable challenges of building space data centers, including providing sufficient real estate for solar arrays and addressing efficient thermal management mechanisms in a vacuum environment – hurdles unique to space that don't have simple solutions from Earth analogs.

This makes the case for bringing data centers to space less persuasive, given the current state of technology and economics. However, it leaves room for future advancements and innovation in space structures and launch economics that could one day make such a vision feasible. Until then, while exciting, Starcloud's proposal seems more like a flight of fancy than a practical enterprise.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion critiques Starcloud’s space data center (SDC) proposal, highlighting technical, logistical, and economic challenges:

1. **Hardware Reliability & Maintenance:**
   - Launch stresses (vibration, G-forces) could cause high initial failure rates, akin to the "bathtub curve" of hardware reliability. Redundancy is critical, but space complicates repairs. Unlike terrestrial data centers, replacing failed components in space would require frequent, costly launches or advanced robotics.
   - Microsoft’s underwater data centers (with lower failure rates) are cited as a more practical alternative, but space radiation and vacuum conditions pose unique risks, such as single-event upsets (SEUs) damaging electronics.

2. **Thermal Management:**
   - Cooling in space is a major hurdle. Traditional fans and liquid cooling won’t work in a vacuum, necessitating radiators or conductive materials. Thermal systems alone could require 13+ Starship launches, per the analysis.

3. **Radiation & Environmental Risks:**
   - Radiation in low Earth orbit (LEO) increases component failure risks. Radiation-hardened hardware is heavier and costlier, compounding launch costs. Debris collisions (Kessler Syndrome) also threaten long-term viability.

4. **Launch Costs & Logistics:**
   - Starcloud’s claimed $30/kg launch cost is deemed unrealistic; estimates closer to $500–$1,000/kg would balloon the project’s budget. Regular resupply launches for replacements/upgrades (e.g., every 5–6 years) further strain feasibility.

5. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Some suggest swarms of smaller, cheaper satellites with microwave mesh networks for redundancy, but this introduces coordination challenges and debris risks. Others propose simplified, over-provisioned servers to offset failures.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the concept is innovative, current technology and economics make space data centers impractical. Advances in radiation hardening, in-orbit servicing, or reusable rockets might change this, but for now, terrestrial or underwater solutions remain more viable. The proposal is seen as aspirational but lacking a realistic path forward.

In a recent blog post, Paul Sangle-Ferriere, co-founder of Cubic, shared the journey of refining their AI code review agent to be less noisy and more efficient. Initially designed to perform preliminary reviews on pull requests, the AI was criticized for cluttering feedback with low-value comments and false positives. Developers found themselves sifting through unnecessary noise to identify meaningful insights.

To combat this, the Cubic team embarked on a thorough overhaul of their AI's architecture, managing to cut false positives by over 50%. Here's how they achieved this transformation:

**1. Explicit Reasoning Logs:** One major innovation was requiring the AI to articulate its reasoning before suggesting feedback. By doing so, they could trace and correct flawed decision-making processes and ensure suggestions were well-founded.

**2. Streamlined Toolkit:** By trimming down their AI's toolset to essential components only, they removed unnecessary complexity and distractions, leading to more precise outputs.

**3. Specialized Micro-Agents:** Instead of a monolithic AI trying to handle everything, Cubic switched to a set of specialized micro-agents, each focused on a specific task such as security checks or code duplication. This specialization allowed the agents to operate with higher precision within their narrow scopes.

These changes not only halved the median number of comments on pull requests but also significantly boosted developer trust and engagement. The improvements resulted in faster, more impactful review processes, allowing teams to concentrate on genuinely critical issues and effectively merge changes.

Key takeaways include the importance of requiring AI to clearly explain its reasoning, simplifying toolsets to focus on frequently used tools, and employing specialized micro-agents to reduce cognitive overload and enhance precision. This strategic approach can serve as a valuable model for other AI solutions aiming to balance thoroughness with clarity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

   - Skepticism arose around monolithic AI systems, with anecdotes shared about refactoring large prompts into smaller components for better precision.

2. **Confidence Ratings & Reliability**:  
   - The AI’s confidence scores drew criticism as arbitrary or misleading. Comments likened them to "recursive confidence_rating_in_confidence_rating" loops, arguing they lack real meaning. Some compared the issue to AI "hallucinations," emphasizing the gap between generated metrics and actionable insights.  
   - Security contexts were flagged as particularly sensitive—even a small false-positive rate could undermine trust.

3. **False Positives & Noise Reduction**:  
   - While Cubic’s claimed 50% reduction in false positives was noted, questions arose about its real-world impact. For example, in security reviews, even a 1% error rate might still pose risks.  
   - Many users reported frustration with low-value comments, noting that 80–90% of AI feedback was irrelevant due to missing context or misinterpretations of code.

4. **Practical Workflow Concerns**:  
   - Developers shared mixed experiences: Some found AI comments helpful for catching edge cases, while others dismissed them as noise. Tools like semantic code search or integrations with existing review workflows were suggested for improving relevance.  
   - A recurring theme was the trade-off between automation and human judgment. For example, toggling AI feedback on/off or using it as a supplementary aid, not a replacement.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Discussions touched on AI’s role in developer workflows, with some expressing concern about tools marketed as replacements for human coders. Others emphasized the need for deterministic logic in critical systems, contrasting it with the "non-deterministic" nature of AI.  
   - Philosophical debates emerged around the scientific method’s role in refining AI systems (trial-and-error vs. structured experimentation).

In a landmark case for the AI industry, Anthropic has scored a significant legal win regarding the incorporation of copyrighted texts into AI training data under the doctrine of fair use. The decision, handed down by Judge William Alsup, allows Anthropic to continue using millions of print books, which they scanned into digital form for internal research. This was deemed transformative and thus qualifying as fair use. However, the company still faces a jury trial concerning their unauthorized acquisition of millions of pirated ebooks, which do not qualify for fair use protection.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers in 2021, initially relied on pirated libraries such as Books3 and Library Genesis to build their data resources. The recent ruling details how they later shifted strategies, investing heavily in purchasing and scanning print books to replace illicit copies. This case places a spotlight on the contentious issue of whether training Language Learning Models (LLMs) with unlicensed data falls under fair use. Judge Alsup's nuanced perspective equated the process to how humans read and internalize information, asserting that charging them for each act of using a book's information would be impractical.

The decision is particularly pivotal given the judge's reputation; Alsup, known for his tech-savvy approach in cases like Oracle v. Google, harnesses his programming hobbyist background in his legal reasoning. As this case unfolds, it highlights ongoing debates about intellectual property rights in an AI-driven world. Meanwhile, Anthropic's actions signal their resolve to create a vast, legally sound data library for AI development.

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's legal victory highlights several key themes and critiques:  

1. **Copyright Law vs. AI Scale**: Users argue that existing copyright frameworks are ill-equipped for AI's capabilities. While humans reading/using books is manageable, AI processing millions of texts simultaneously disrupts traditional economic models meant to incentivize creativity. One commenter likened it to charging humans for "breathing" CO₂ emissions, underscoring the impracticality of applying old rules to AI's scale.  

2. **Ethical and Legal Gray Areas**: Concerns were raised about corporations exploiting abstract rights and the lack of clear liability frameworks for AI systems. Comparisons were drawn to self-driving car liability, questioning who bears responsibility (e.g., developers vs. users) in cases of AI misuse or errors.  

3. **Cultural References**: A comment referenced Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where digitized books from discarded copies fuel AI, mirroring Anthropic’s scanning strategy. Others critiqued the sourcing of data as akin to "stealing" or "burglary," highlighting ethical discomfort with AI’s data acquisition methods.  

4. **Industry Implications**: Speculation arose about future legal battles (e.g., Disney/Universal vs. OpenAI) and whether large media corporations might challenge AI’s use of copyrighted content, similar to past tech copyright disputes (e.g., Oracle v. Google).  

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism about current laws keeping pace with AI’s transformative impact, ethical concerns over data sourcing, and the need for updated regulatory frameworks to address these novel challenges.

   - Some speculate that Chrome might push users toward paid Google APIs if local models are unmanageable.  

2. **Chrome vs. Firefox Approaches**:
   - Firefox’s lightweight models and explicit user consent for downloads (e.g., via API-triggered prompts) are praised. Chrome’s automatic model downloads without clear permissions draw skepticism.
   - Developers highlight potentials for **client-side extensions** (e.g., replacing Twitter’s broken translation button) and offline use in Firefox, though Chrome’s API remains more feature-rich.

3. **Standardization & Privacy Concerns**:
   - Mozilla and WebKit criticize Chrome’s API design for exposing sensitive data (e.g., model availability, download progress), risking **browser fingerprinting**. Advocates argue minimal information exposure is safer.
   - Debate arises over whether Chrome’s API should be standardized via **W3C**. Critics argue Chrome promotes its proprietary features as “standards,” while others defend community-driven standardization processes.

4. **Alternative Solutions**:
   - Developers mention **Hugging Face models** (e.g., `nllb-200`) or JavaScript/WASM-based translators, though these lag behind Google’s speed. One user reported translating 3k characters took 10 minutes with alternative tools vs. seconds via Google.
   - Suggestions include browser-prompted selective model downloads to save storage.

5. **Translation Quality**:
   - Complaints about `t-translate` (client-side tools) degrading text quality, with users abandoning certain tools. Some prefer server-side APIs but acknowledge trade-offs in privacy and cost.

6. **Adoption & Impact**:
   - Excitement exists for **local translation APIs enabling multilingual apps** (e.g., travel tools, comment translation). Concerns persist about Google’s dominance and whether smaller browsers can realistically adopt large models.

**Theme**: The community balances enthusiasm for modern translation capabilities with skepticism around resource demands, privacy, and vendor lock-in. Firefox’s privacy-centric model and Mozilla’s cautious stance contrast with Chrome’s ambitious but heavyweight approach. Standardization debates highlight tensions between innovation and interoperability.

### Anthropic destroyed millions of print books to build its AI models

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/anthropic-destroyed-millions-of-print-books-to-build-its-ai-models/) | 26 points | by [bayindirh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bayindirh) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381838)

In a groundbreaking yet controversial move, AI company Anthropic has invested millions in physically scanning books to build Claude, an AI assistant akin to ChatGPT. This process, revealed through court documents, involved the massive destruction of print books, cutting them from bindings, and scanning them into digital formats—all to train their AI systems. Unlike the non-destructive scanning methods like those used by Google Books, which returned borrowed library books, Anthropic's approach opted for speed and cost-efficiency, sacrificing physical copies for digital ones.

Court rulings have deemed this method as falling under "fair use," mainly because Anthropic systematically purchased and subsequently destroyed its physical book copies, retaining the digital versions strictly for internal use. These tactics underscore the AI industry's ceaseless quest for high-quality data to feed vast language models, directly impacting their ability to generate accurate and cohesive outputs. The urgency in obtaining professionally edited texts without lengthy negotiations saw Anthropic bypass initial reliance on pirated ebooks for the legal safety of purchased books, albeit at the expense of their physical form.

While no rare books were claimed to have been harmed, this method starkly contrasts with initiatives like The Internet Archive's non-destructive methods or OpenAI's partnerships with institutions like Harvard, which preserve historic manuscripts while digitizing them.

Ultimately, Claude, the AI born from this transformation process, reflects on its creation from the "ashes" of discarded books, offering a narrative as intricate as the ethical and legal debates its existence stirs.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's book-scanning method to train AI (Claude) revolved around several key themes:

1. **Cultural and Fictional Comparisons**:  
   Commenters drew parallels to sci-fi narratives like Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where books are shredded for digitization, and real-world historical efforts (e.g., reconstructing shredded Stasi files). These references framed the debate as both dystopian and pragmatic.

2. **Legal and Ethical Debates**:  
   - While a court ruled destructive scanning lawful under *fair use* (as Anthropic purchased books and retained digital copies for internal use), critics argued that legality doesn’t equate to ethicality.  
   - Concerns were raised about the “slippery slope” of normalizing destructive practices for corporate AI training, with some users condemning the wastefulness and disrespect for physical books.

3. **Environmental and Practical Concerns**:  
   - Critics highlighted the environmental impact of discarding physical books, though others countered that bulk recycling might mitigate waste.  
   - Non-destructive methods (e.g., Google Books, Internet Archive) were praised for preserving originals, while DRM restrictions on e-books were noted as a barrier, making physical book scanning a cheaper, legally safer alternative.

4. **Industry Practices and Criticism**:  
   - AI companies were accused of prioritizing cost-efficiency and data quality over ethical considerations. Some users dismissed Anthropic’s marketing framing, arguing that purchasing commodity books for destruction is neither novel nor noble.  
   - Rare books were reportedly spared, but critics emphasized the symbolic harm of treating books as disposable data sources.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The case was seen as a microcosm of wider battles over copyright, transformative use, and corporate power in the AI era.  
   - Skepticism lingered about AI’s societal impact, with one user likening the race for AI dominance to a “Mile Island” scenario, hinting at unchecked risks.

In essence, the debate balanced technical necessity against ethical and cultural preservation, reflecting tensions between innovation and tradition in the digital age.
