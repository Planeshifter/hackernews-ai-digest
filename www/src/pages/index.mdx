### CoRF: Colorizing Radiance Fields Using Knowledge Distillation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07668) | 59 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634018)

Researchers from the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition have developed a method called CoRF for colorizing radiance fields using knowledge distillation. Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods allow for high-quality novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, when applying image or video-based colorization methods to the generated grayscale novel views, artifacts due to inconsistency across views can occur. The researchers propose a distillation-based method that transfers color knowledge from existing 2D colorization methods to the radiance field network. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior colorized novel views while maintaining cross-view consistency. The method is also effective for colorizing radiance field networks trained from infrared (IR) multi-view images and old grayscale multi-view image sequences. This research has significant implications for improving the quality and consistency of synthesized images in computer vision applications.

### Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01603) | 65 points | by [beefman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beefman) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37627615)

A new research paper titled "Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization" proposes a machine learning model that aims to achieve systematic generalization, a human-like ability to learn compositional rules from limited data and apply them to unseen combinations in various domains. The authors introduce the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR), which utilizes a Grounded Symbol System (GSS) with combinatorial syntax and semantics. NSR consists of separate modules for neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning, which are jointly learned using a deduction-abduction algorithm. The researchers demonstrate that NSR achieves superior systematic generalization on three benchmarks from different domains: semantic parsing, string manipulation, and arithmetic reasoning. NSR outperforms state-of-the-art models on the arithmetic reasoning benchmark by approximately 23%. The authors attribute NSR's strong generalization to its symbolic representation and inductive biases, as well as its better transferability compared to existing neural-symbolic approaches. The paper provides insights into how NSR can effectively model various sequence-to-sequence tasks.

The discussion on this submission started with a comment pointing out that existing machine learning models often fail to achieve human-like systematic generalization. The commenter also mentions a recent paper published by the creators of ChatGPT, reinforcing the relevance of the topic. Another commenter responds, expressing their belief that the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR) mentioned in the submission is similar to an existing model called MoE (Mixture of Experts). They suggest that the NSR implementation might be costly compared to the MoE approach, but it is not clear from the comment why this is the case.

### Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors Are Universal Learners

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06979) | 91 points | by [dataminer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dataminer) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37619513)

Researchers have discovered that auto-regressive next-token predictors, such as language models, have the ability to solve complex tasks involving logical and mathematical reasoning. In a recent study, Eran Malach presented a theoretical framework for studying these predictors and showed that even simple models like linear and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. The researchers introduced a new complexity measure called "length complexity" and analyzed its relationship with other notions of complexity. They also conducted experiments that demonstrated the non-trivial performance of these predictors on text generation and arithmetic tasks. The study suggests that the power of language models may be attributed to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, rather than a specific choice of architecture.

The discussion around the submission involves various perspectives on the power and implications of language models in solving complex tasks. Some commenters highlight the deterministic nature of linguistic determinism and its influence on thinking processes. Others point out that language skills do not necessarily equate to general intelligence and that there is a wide range of models and formalisms beyond Turing completeness that can approximate different types of thinking. 

There is also a conversation about the efficacy of language models in terms of practical applications, such as medical research and clinical note analysis. Some suggest that language models could be helpful in generating prompts for medical reports, while others caution that these models can encounter difficulties in generating coherent narratives.

There is interest in the concept of training models regressively and the challenges posed by difficult tasks, as well as the potential of intermediate steps in internal processing and the learning of step-by-step procedures. Some commenters express curiosity about the workings of language models and suggest that the focusing on regressive models in learning may enhance their performance.

One commenter provides a link to a related discussion on Hacker News with additional perspectives on the topic. Another commenter criticizes the practice of prompt engineering and suggests exploring alternative approaches.
