Bret Victor's essay, "Learnable Programming: Designing a programming system for understanding programs," explores the concept of creating a programming system that is easily understandable and accessible to people. He criticizes programming languages like JavaScript and Processing for not supporting powerful ways of thinking and ignoring decades of learning about learning. Victor argues that programming should be turned into something that is understandable by people, rather than forcing people to think like a machine. He presents a set of design principles for an environment and language suitable for learning programming. These principles include allowing the learner to read the vocabulary, follow the flow of the program, see the state of the computer, create by reacting and abstracting, and providing identity, metaphor, decomposition, recomposition, and readability in the language. Victor emphasizes that the features of a programming environment or language are not the most important aspect; what matters is how these features convey a message and enable the programmer to think. He gives examples of how a programming environment can make meaning transparent and provide labels and explanations to help learners understand the code. Overall, Victor believes that creating an environment and language that supports powerful ways of thinking and makes programming more understandable by people is the key to getting people to understand programming.

In the comments on Hacker News, there is a discussion surrounding Bret Victor's essay "Learnable Programming." One user shares a link to a video interpretation of Victor's ideas called Leporellojs. Another user mentions that they found it helpful to present programming differently, as traditional text-based programming can be frustrating.

### Efficient streaming language models with attention sinks

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm) | 404 points | by [guywithabowtie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=guywithabowtie) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37740932)

The MIT-HAN lab has released a new project called "Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks." The project aims to deploy large language models (LLMs) in streaming applications without sacrificing efficiency and performance. It addresses two major challenges: the extensive memory consumption of caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) during decoding, and the inability of popular LLMs to handle longer texts than the training sequence length. The project introduces StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite-length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without the need for fine-tuning. The researchers also discovered the concept of attention sinks, where keeping the KV of initial tokens can largely recover the performance of window attention. They found that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training further improves streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. To use StreamingLLM, the environment needs to be set up, and the project provides instructions and code examples for running a streaming chatbot.

In the discussion, there are various points raised about the MIT-HAN lab's project on efficient streaming language models with attention sinks. Some of the key highlights include:

1. Some users point out that the infinite-length inputs mentioned in the summary are misleading and clarify that the project focuses on efficient usage of attention windows.
2. The use of sliding context windows and shifting relevant information forward through the layers is seen as a straightforward technique.
3. The concept of attention sinks, where initial tokens' key and value states are kept to recover performance, is found interesting. The limitations of using softmax and potential solutions are also discussed.
4. The idea of adding attention cache memory as a solution is considered intriguing, with references made to similar approaches used in vision transformers.
5. The discussion also touches on the challenges faced by large language models and how they compare to recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in terms of training and performance.
6. There are mentions of related projects, such as RWKV1 and INKBOT-13B-8k-02, and discussions about the limitations and integrity of public leaderboards.
7. Some comments highlight the need for more diverse evaluation and verification methods and the potential advantages of transformers over RNNs.
8. The use of llama2, a library for non-binary conversational summarization, is mentioned as a relevant tool.
9. The FAQ section of the project is referenced for further clarifications and explanations.

### FlashAttention: Fast Transformer training with long sequences

#### [Submission URL](https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention) | 146 points | by [kristianp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kristianp) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37724861)

Transformers have become increasingly powerful, but training them on long sequences has remained a challenge. The attention layer, which is at the core of Transformers, poses a bottleneck in terms of compute and memory. Doubling the sequence length would quadruple the runtime and memory requirements.

However, there is now a solution: FlashAttention, a new algorithm that speeds up attention and reduces its memory footprint without any approximation. Since its release six months ago, FlashAttention has been widely adopted by organizations and research labs to accelerate their training and inference processes.

Tri Dao, a researcher and part-time research fellow at Adept, has been collaborating with the company to improve FlashAttention. They have developed a key improvement that enables FlashAttention to be fast for long sequences, which opens up the possibility of training large language models with longer context.

For example, FlashAttention is now up to 2.7 times faster than a standard PyTorch implementation and up to 2.2 times faster than the optimized implementation from Megatron-LM, even at small batch sizes, when used on sequences with a length of 8k. This increased speed allows for training with longer context, resulting in higher-quality models.

The motivation for tackling long sequences is to scale up the context length of Transformers. Currently, the multihead attention layer in Transformers has a runtime and memory requirement that grows quadratically with the input sequence length. By training models that can understand books, high-resolution images, webpages, multi-turn user interactions, and long-form videos, the hope is to advance AI capabilities.

FlashAttention achieves its speed and efficiency improvements by reordering the attention computation and leveraging classical techniques like tiling and recomputation. These techniques significantly speed up attention and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. However, FlashAttention was not initially optimized for the case of super long sequences, where batch sizes and numbers of heads are small, due to insufficient parallelism.

To optimize for long sequences with small batch sizes and small numbers of heads, FlashAttention now introduces attention parallelism. Each attention head uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU memory to a faster cache, compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output. This reduction in memory reads and writes brings significant speedup in most cases.

In the case of long sequences with small batch sizes or small numbers of heads, FlashAttention parallelizes over the sequence length dimension in order to make better use of the multiprocessors on the GPU. This results in a significant speedup for this regime.

Overall, FlashAttention offers a solution for training Transformers on long sequences, enabling the training of models with longer context. With its improved speed and memory efficiency, FlashAttention is making strides in advancing AI capabilities and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with Transformers.

The discussion about FlashAttention on Hacker News revolves around the release of FlashAttention, the efficiency and speed improvements it offers, and its impact on training Transformers on long sequences. Some key points highlighted in the comments are:
