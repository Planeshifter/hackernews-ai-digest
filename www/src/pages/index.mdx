### Self-Assembling Artificial Neural Networks Through Neural Developmental Programs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08197) | 65 points | by [hardmaru](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hardmaru) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37759668)

Researchers Elias Najarro, Shyam Sudhakaran, and Sebastian Risi have published a paper titled "Towards Self-Assembling Artificial Neural Networks through Neural Developmental Programs." The paper explores the idea of creating neural networks that grow through a developmental process similar to embryonic development in biological organisms. The researchers propose a Neural Developmental Program (NDP) that guides the growth process through local communication. The paper investigates the role of neural growth on various machine learning benchmarks and optimization methods. The authors also highlight future research directions and opportunities enabled by this self-organizing approach to neural network development.

The discussion on this submission includes various perspectives and opinions on the topic. 

One commenter, Nevermark, points out that the brain wasn't built like artificial neural networks. They believe that DNA programming in biological organisms changes slowly through evolution and is not specifically designed to work on survival problems. They also mention that not every aspect of the brain's architecture is custom-designed for specific problems and data.

Another commenter, vcty, suggests that brains need neural networks for evaluation, including terms like brain development, sexual dimorphism, and genetics. They argue that it's not as simple as changing sensory inputs over time and that brain development involves scruples and crosses.

Great_psy finds the idea promising but suggests that it requires extra competition to achieve self-assembly. They compare it to the competition that occurs in human-designed neural networks.

Mdlss expresses surprise that designing neural network architectures is a problem, as neural networks fight by humans tend to work well. They also mention the concept of self-optimizing architectures not being standard or documented.

Signa11 responds to Mdlss, agreeing that designing neural architectures is a problem, but they suggest that self-optimizing architectures can be achieved through evolutionary algorithms such as Neuroevolution of augmenting topologies (NEAT).

Nsphr adds to the conversation by discussing the role of evolution and environment in the development of organisms, suggesting that organisms not only try to respond logically to the environment but may also recreate and regenerate the environment.

Drgnwrtr believes that designing neural network architectures is a difficult problem. They mention the limitations of current state-of-the-art neural network architectures and the need for high-quality training data to train neural networks effectively.

Great_psy suggests that maybe humans are building neural network architectures, and a neural network design would be a byproduct of human design. They propose that neural networks eventually just begin to compete with human-designed architectures, and then human design becomes the optima for complexity optimization.

In another comment, Dsgn discusses the current state of designing neural network architectures. They mention that the current crop of large language models (LLMs) started with a predefined neural network architecture, but things like the number of layers, class cost function, and specific architecture choices can be explored. They argue that this kind of knowledge leveraged by human engineers could be applied to building more optimized neural network architectures.

The final comment by Djldmn provides an abstract of the paper, mentioning that while biological nervous systems are fundamentally different from current artificial neural networks, their growth process shares similarities with embryonic development in biological organisms. The paper proposes a Neural Developmental Program (NDP) that guides the growth process through local communication. The authors investigate the role of neural growth on various machine learning benchmarks and optimization methods and highlight future research directions enabled by this self-organizing approach to neural network development.

Bret Victor's essay, "Learnable Programming: Designing a programming system for understanding programs," explores the concept of creating a programming system that is easily understandable and accessible to people. He criticizes programming languages like JavaScript and Processing for not supporting powerful ways of thinking and ignoring decades of learning about learning. Victor argues that programming should be turned into something that is understandable by people, rather than forcing people to think like a machine. He presents a set of design principles for an environment and language suitable for learning programming. These principles include allowing the learner to read the vocabulary, follow the flow of the program, see the state of the computer, create by reacting and abstracting, and providing identity, metaphor, decomposition, recomposition, and readability in the language. Victor emphasizes that the features of a programming environment or language are not the most important aspect; what matters is how these features convey a message and enable the programmer to think. He gives examples of how a programming environment can make meaning transparent and provide labels and explanations to help learners understand the code. Overall, Victor believes that creating an environment and language that supports powerful ways of thinking and makes programming more understandable by people is the key to getting people to understand programming.

In the comments on Hacker News, there is a discussion surrounding Bret Victor's essay "Learnable Programming." One user shares a link to a video interpretation of Victor's ideas called Leporellojs. Another user mentions that they found it helpful to present programming differently, as traditional text-based programming can be frustrating.

### Efficient streaming language models with attention sinks

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm) | 404 points | by [guywithabowtie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=guywithabowtie) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37740932)

The MIT-HAN lab has released a new project called "Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks." The project aims to deploy large language models (LLMs) in streaming applications without sacrificing efficiency and performance. It addresses two major challenges: the extensive memory consumption of caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) during decoding, and the inability of popular LLMs to handle longer texts than the training sequence length. The project introduces StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite-length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence length without the need for fine-tuning. The researchers also discovered the concept of attention sinks, where keeping the KV of initial tokens can largely recover the performance of window attention. They found that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training further improves streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup. To use StreamingLLM, the environment needs to be set up, and the project provides instructions and code examples for running a streaming chatbot.

In the discussion, there are various points raised about the MIT-HAN lab's project on efficient streaming language models with attention sinks. Some of the key highlights include:
