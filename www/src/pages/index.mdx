### Obituary for Cyc

#### [Submission URL](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/cyc/) | 408 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [216 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625474)

In the realm of artificial intelligence, few names evoke as much intrigue as Douglas Lenat's, particularly due to his monumental Cyc project. Begun in 1985, Cyc aimed to crack the nut of artificial general intelligence through an ambitious strategy: scaling symbolic logic by encoding vast amounts of common sense knowledge. Lenat believed that for AI to truly learn and reason like humans, it needed a massive repository of world knowledge to draw from—a theory steeped in his experiences with past projects like the Automated Mathematician and EURISKO.

Despite Lenat's unwavering dedication and the project's staggering investment—culminating in 30 million assertions at the cost of $200 million and 2,000 person-years—the breakthroughs promised never materialized. The Cyc system, conceived as a groundbreaking "knowledge pump," never achieved the self-sustaining knowledge expansion and learning Lenat envisioned. Instead, its practical applications remained rooted in established AI methodologies, akin to those employed by tech giants like Oracle and IBM, offering no discernible competitive edge.

The project's long-term sustainability can partly be attributed to substantial funding from military and commercial sectors. However, this financial footing didn’t translate into revolutionary academic contributions or public success stories. As academia largely shunned Cyc for its inaccessibility and lack of performance on public benchmarks, the project became an insular endeavor, closed off from the outside innovation swirling around in AI research.

Despite the ultimate lack of success in achieving its grand ambitions, the Cyc project stands as a fascinating chapter in AI history—a testament to the challenges of scaling symbolic logic for general intelligence. The story of Cyc, and the "secret history" behind it, underline the complexities and limits of symbolic approaches in AI, raising questions—and lessons—for the field's ongoing evolution. Today, with much of Cyc's archival materials now available for public scrutiny on platforms like GitHub, the legacy of Douglas Lenat's quest sheds light on the perpetual struggle to teach machines to understand the world as deeply as humans do.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legacy of **Douglas Lenat’s Cyc project** and its contrast with modern AI approaches like **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Here’s a concise summary of key points:

### Cyc’s Ambitions vs. Reality
- **Cyc’s Goal**: Encode "common sense" via symbolic logic (e.g., understanding that a person can’t shave with an unplugged electric razor).  
- **Critique**: Despite decades of effort and millions of hand-coded assertions, Cyc struggled with scalability, brittleness, and practical relevance. Participants noted its failure to achieve self-sustaining learning or outperform traditional rule-based systems (e.g., Prolog) or newer data-driven methods.

### Symbolic AI vs. LLMs
- **Symbolic AI (Cyc/GOFAI)**: Relied on explicit rules and logic but was limited by manual curation and inability to handle real-world ambiguity. Examples like SAT solvers and planners were praised for structured problems but criticized for lacking flexibility.  
- **LLMs**: Praised for scaling via vast data and "fuzzy" contextual understanding. While not perfect, LLMs excel at generating plausible outputs by recognizing patterns, even if they lack true reasoning. Critics argued LLMs still struggle with logical rigor (e.g., transitive relations).  

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Bridging the Gap**: Some suggested combining LLMs (for natural language understanding) with symbolic systems (for structured reasoning). For example, using LLMs to translate natural language into Prolog/Python code or structured formats (JSON) for traditional computation.  
- **Use Cases**: LLMs could handle ambiguous tasks (e.g., parsing nutrition labels), while symbolic systems manage precise logic (e.g., scheduling, math).  

### Legacy and Lessons
- **Cyc’s Legacy**: A bold experiment highlighting the challenges of manual knowledge engineering. Its closed, insular development contrasted with today’s open, collaborative AI research.  
- **Modern Parallels**: Debates echoed around whether LLMs are merely "stochastic parrots" or stepping stones toward AGI. Participants acknowledged that neither symbolic nor statistical methods alone suffice for general intelligence.  

### Final Takeaway
The discussion underscores a shift from rigid symbolic systems (Cyc) to flexible, data-driven models (LLMs), while acknowledging that **hybrid approaches**—leveraging the strengths of both paradigms—might be the future of AI. Cyc remains a cautionary tale about scalability and the limits of human-curated knowledge, even as LLMs redefine what’s possible.

### Solving a “Layton Puzzle” with Prolog

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/a48fce5b-8a05-4302-b620-9b26f057f145/) | 101 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625452)

Have you ever wanted to solve a brain-tickling puzzle using logic programming? Here's a delightful tale of solving a "Layton Puzzle" using Prolog—a classic logic programming language. Imagine a test with 10 questions, each with true/false options, and you'd like to determine the fourth student's score based on the scores of the first three students with known answers. Pablo Meier once tackled a similar challenge, using Prolog to crack the code, but this tale goes a step further with an elegant solution in fewer lines of code.

Firstly, here's the setup: You know how three students scored and their answers, and need to predict the elusive score of the fourth student. With a quick dive into Prolog, the programmer begins by importing essential modules for handling inequalities and setting up constraints. Using Prolog’s pattern matching prowess, we create a recursive function to calculate a score by comparing answers to a key, cleverly bypassing more procedural if-else statements traditional programming uses.

The magic of Prolog shines here with its bidirectionality; you can use the program both to verify a known score and to deduce an unknown one. Through predicates and mappings, Prolog also generates potential answer keys, further showcasing the elegant and multipurpose nature of the language.

When the program runs, it finds four possible keys all producing the same score for the mystery student, revealing that the puzzle isn't broken but intriguingly self-consistent. This logic solution not only solves the problem but does so with remarkable efficiency—15 lines to accomplish what took 80 lines in another version. It's puzzles like these and solutions like this that show the enduring magic of logic programming.

So if you find yourself pondering logic puzzles or practical applications with Prolog, keep in mind the potential simplicity behind seemingly complex challenges. Plus, who doesn't want a chance to show up a fellow programmer with fewer lines of smarter code?

The Hacker News discussion revolves around solving a Professor Layton logic puzzle using Prolog and alternative methods, with key points summarized below:

The approach leverages constraints to find valid answer keys, revealing Colin’s score as **60** across four possible configurations.  
   - Debates arose about Prolog’s practicality, comparing implementations (SWI-Prolog, SICStus) and praising its bidirectional reasoning for logic puzzles.  

2. **Z3 in Python**  
   - A user demonstrated a concise 7-line solution using Z3, a theorem prover, to model the problem declaratively. Others highlighted its simplicity compared to Prolog ([example blog post](https://happyhacks.bearblog.dev/solving-lytn-pzzl-wth-z3)).

### **Human-Logic Approaches**
   - A manual, heuristic-driven breakdown analyzed overlaps in student answers to deduce Colin’s score. For instance, comparing Mary’s and Dan’s incorrect answers narrowed down possible correct keys, concluding Colin scored **60** by leveraging shared patterns.

### **Nostalgia & Puzzle Design**
   - Fans reminisced about the *Professor Layton* game series (specifically *Diabolical Box*), praising its puzzle design. Some linked the challenge to classic logic puzzles like the Zebra Puzzle, often tackled with Prolog.

### **Broader Discussions**
   - **Prolog’s Relevance**: A tangent debated Prolog’s decline in popularity despite its strengths in constraint-solving, referencing a [2023 thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35623625) on its historical context.  
   - **Educational Value**: Users emphasized puzzles like these for teaching constraint programming and reducing trial-and-error through structured logic.

### **Key Takeaways**
   - The puzzle highlights the elegance of logic programming (Prolog) and modern solvers (Z3).  
   - While Prolog’s syntax and ecosystem quirks drew criticism, its suitability for combinatorial problems remains unmatched.  
   - Community appreciation for both computational *and* manual problem-solving underscored the puzzle’s design and educational appeal.

### Meta got caught gaming AI benchmarks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/meta/645012/meta-llama-4-maverick-benchmarks-gaming) | 328 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [157 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43620452)

Meta recently found itself in hot water after it was revealed that the tech giant may have gamed AI benchmarks to make its new Llama 4 models appear more competitive. Over the weekend, Meta released two new models, Scout and Maverick, asserting that Maverick outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o and others on LMArena, a popular comparison site for AI outputs. However, eagle-eyed AI researchers discovered a crucial bit of information buried in Meta’s documentation: the version of Maverick tested was an "experimental chat version" specifically designed to excel in conversational tasks.

This revelation prompted LMArena to clarify its policies, emphasizing the importance of fair and reproducible evaluations. Meta's spokesperson responded, highlighting their extensive experimentation with custom versions of their AI models. While not violating direct LMArena rules, the incident raises serious concerns about the integrity of AI benchmarks. Developers often rely on these scores to make informed decisions about which AI models to use, but if companies like Meta submit souped-up versions that aren't publicly available, these benchmarks lose their reliability as tools for assessing true performance.

The timing of the release further fueled speculation, as it dropped on a Saturday—a rarity in the tech world. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg simply noted, "That’s when it was ready." The mixed messages and questionable tactics have left many in the AI community scratching their heads, pondering whether benchmarks are becoming more about gaming the system rather than providing genuine insights into AI capabilities. This saga underscores the increasing competitiveness in AI development as companies vie for leadership and recognition.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward Meta’s AI benchmarking practices and connects it to broader criticisms of the company’s internal culture and management strategies. Key themes include:

2. **Cultural Critiques**:  
   - **"Move Fast and Break Things" Legacy**: Commenters argue Meta’s historical emphasis on speed over quality fosters rushed, half-baked releases. This leads to technical debt and undermines long-term product reliability.  
   - **Performance-Driven Pressures**: Employees are incentivized to prioritize metrics (e.g., launching features quickly) over quality to meet review cycles, exacerbating issues like technical debt and unstable AI models.  

3. **Management and Incentive Structures**:  
   - Layoffs and high turnover are critiqued for reducing institutional knowledge, leaving fewer skilled workers to manage complex projects.  
   - The **Hawthorne Effect** and **McNamara Fallacy** are cited: Management’s focus on short-term metrics (e.g., quarterly results) creates temporary performance boosts but neglects sustainable progress, leading to employee burnout and rushed releases.  

4. **Data Quality Questions**:  
   Skepticism arises about whether Meta’s AI improvements stem from better data or are merely tactics to game benchmarks. Users question if the company’s internal data management can support claims of superior model performance.  

5. **Broader Tech Industry Parallels**:  
   Comparisons to Netflix’s high-pressure culture highlight systemic issues in tech, where aggressive performance incentives prioritize rapid delivery over innovation and employee well-being.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects distrust in Meta’s benchmarking claims, linking them to a culture that prioritizes short-term wins and metrics over transparency and quality. Critics argue this undermines both the reliability of AI evaluations and the sustainability of Meta’s advancements.

### SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators

#### [Submission URL](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/seedlm-compressing) | 165 points | by [pizza](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pizza) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599967)

In the ever-evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the challenge of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently has reached a breakthrough with the introduction of SeedLM, presented at the ICLR 2025 conference. This paper by Rasoul Shafipour and co-authors rolls out a game-changing compression method that could redefine how NLP models manage time and resource demands.

SeedLM operates by transforming the cumbersome weight files of LLMs into seeds for a pseudo-random generator, specifically leveraging a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). This technique circumvents the usual bottleneck of memory access during inference, allowing models like Llama3 70B to maintain their zero-shot accuracy even when compressed down to 3- or 4-bit numbers and remaining on par or surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

This novel approach shines not only because it delivers robust compression ratios but crucially does so without needing additional calibration data—streamlining the deployment across a range of tasks without bespoke adjustments. For practitioners deploying models on-device, the implications are significant: a potential fourfold increase in speed over FP16 baselines, as observed in FPGA-based benchmarks, promises enhanced efficiency as model scales continue to grow.

Moreover, the paper reflects on the balance between accuracy and efficiency, a task made easier by SeedLM's data-free compression, which harnesses unused computational capacity for quicker memory-bound processes. This minimization of resource demand makes SeedLM an attractive antidote to the high costs usually associated with running LLMs, paving the way for wider application in both consumer and enterprise systems.

With such advancements, SeedLM represents a beacon of hope for the NLP community, pushing the boundaries of how far and fast LLMs can go without incurring prohibitive costs or complexity increases, all while maintaining top-tier performance.

The Hacker News discussion on SeedLM, a novel LLM compression method, highlights technical debates, comparisons, and skepticism:

1. **Technical Insights & Comparisons**:  
   - Users note SeedLM’s use of pseudo-random seeds (via LFSR) to compress weights into 3-4 bits, avoiding calibration data. This contrasts with quantization methods like AWQ or OmniQuant, which require training or calibration.  
   - Accuracy debates arise: SeedLM’s results for models like LLaMA 70B (4-bit: 78.06% vs. FP16 baseline: 79.51%) are seen as competitive but not universally superior. Some argue larger models degrade more gracefully with quantization.  

2. **Implementation Advantages**:  
   - The method’s simplicity—generating weights on-the-fly via PRNG seeds—is praised for reducing memory bandwidth and enabling faster inference, especially on memory-bound hardware (e.g., FPGAs).  
   - Unlike quantization-aware training, SeedLM’s "data-free" approach streamlines deployment but raises questions about handling outlier weights in sparse LLM activations.  

3. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - The paper’s October 2024 date sparks jokes about it being an April Fools’ prank. Others question the information-theoretic feasibility of compressing models using pseudo-random sequences, comparing it to JPEG’s DCT or the Library of Babel.  
   - Some liken the approach to “lossy compression,” replacing exact weights with pre-defined patterns, akin to image compression.  

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Discussions link SeedLM to Apple/Meta’s on-device AI efforts, noting hardware constraints (e.g., iPhones’ 8GB RAM) and the gap between research and productization.  
   - Parallels are drawn to knowledge compression in documentation, emphasizing minimal principles to reconstruct complex systems—a theme resonating with LLM efficiency goals.  

Overall, the community recognizes SeedLM’s potential but remains cautious about its claims, balancing excitement for faster, cheaper LLMs with technical scrutiny.

### Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain

#### [Submission URL](https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/) | 60 points | by [m463](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=m463) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543)

In a step forward for machine learning (ML) security, a new tool called "model-signing" has officially launched on PyPI, offering developers a robust method for signing and verifying ML models. This project, released on April 4, 2025, meets the growing demand for secure ML applications amid a rising wave of cyber threats targeting AI models. Created in collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, model-signing aims to emulate the protections typical of traditional software supply chains by safeguarding the integrity and origin of ML models.

The tool facilitates the signing process using Sigstore, a transparency log service, which eliminates the need for managing cryptographic keys by using short-lived tokens. However, it also supports traditional signing through public keys and certificates, broadening its applicability. Signatures are stored in a Sigstore bundle in JSON format, ensuring transparency and verifiable integrity for all involved.

Users can leverage a command-line interface (CLI) to sign and verify models, with flexibility across multiple signing methods, including key and certificate-based options. The CLI simplifies the verification process, allowing users to confirm that a model’s signature stems from a trusted source, thereby ensuring it hasn’t been altered post-training.

Moreover, model-signing takes advantage of Sigstore’s transparency logs, which record signing events, enabling discovery and validation. This functionality is further supported by a log monitor being developed for GitHub Actions, providing an additional layer of security for those maintaining signing identities.

This groundbreaking tool is vital for developers and those managing ML models as it safeguards against unauthorized modifications and boosts trust in AI technologies' integrity. To get started, users need Python 3.9 or newer and can explore further through the project's documentation and resources available on GitHub.

The Hacker News discussion on the "model-signing" tool highlights both support for the initiative and key concerns about its scope and practical application. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Composite Hashing for Multi-File Models**: Commenters emphasize that ML models often comprise multiple files, making a single hash insufficient. A composite hash (e.g., aggregating hashes of all files) is necessary to ensure comprehensive integrity verification. The tool addresses this by storing signatures in a Sigstore bundle for transparency.

2. **Broader Security Standards Needed**: While model-signing is praised as a step forward, users stress the need for holistic standards like **C2PA** (for content provenance) and **SLSA** (for supply chain integrity). These could address gaps in verifying training data, model provenance, and inference behavior, which aren’t covered by signing alone.

3. **Inference-Time Integrity as a Separate Challenge**: A recurring theme is that model signatures verify the model’s origin and integrity but do not ensure trustworthy outputs during inference. Malicious models or those trained on flawed data could still produce harmful results, requiring separate solutions for runtime verification.

4. **Practical Concerns and Scope**: Some question the practicality of relying solely on hashing, especially if the underlying model software or logic is compromised. Sigstore’s integration is seen as beneficial, but users highlight the need for additional validation layers (e.g., attesting training processes or monitoring inference behavior).

5. **Limitations Against Malicious Actors**: The tool doesn’t prevent bad actors from signing models trained on malicious data. Even with valid signatures, users may deploy harmful models unknowingly, necessitating broader checks (e.g., training audits or third-party attestations).

6. **Future Directions**: Optimism exists around projects extending model-signing to include inference validation and tighter integration with frameworks like **SLSA for ML**. Anticipation for ML-specific security features and transparency logs (via Sigstore) is noted as a promising path forward.

**In summary**, the community welcomes model-signing as a foundational tool for securing ML supply chains but emphasizes that it’s one piece of a larger puzzle. Future efforts should focus on comprehensive standards, provenance tracking, and inference-time verification to fully address AI security challenges.

The AI industry is abuzz with talk of "content agents," sophisticated systems capable of carrying out complex tasks such as scheduling and even changing settings on a computer. While these agents are promising as helpful assistants, they also pose a significant threat when it comes to cybersecurity. These agents can potentially execute cyberattacks at an unprecedented scale, identifying vulnerable targets and stealing sensitive data more efficiently than human hackers. Mark Stockley of Malwarebytes foresees a future where cyberattacks are predominantly executed by AI agents.

In response, organizations like Palisade Research are taking proactive measures to understand and counter these threats. They have developed the LLM Agent Honeypot, a system designed to detect AI agents attempting to breach security on faux sites filled with seemingly valuable information. This project aims to act as an early-warning system, by tracking and analyzing how these agents operate in the wild.

Since its inception, this honeypot has logged millions of access attempts, with eight identified as possible AI agents, proving that the AI field is starting to overlap with the realm of cybercrime. Researchers employ a variety of techniques, like prompt-injection methods, to identify and study these AI incursions.

As cybersecurity experts anticipate agent-led attacks, the industry grapples with the challenges of detection and prevention. The ability of AI agents to adapt and evade standard defenses makes them much more potent than traditional bots. In this landscape likened to a new Wild West, proactive measures like those by Palisade Research could be pivotal in shaping a secure future amidst the rapid evolution of AI.

The discussion on the submission about AI-driven cyber threats highlights several key points and reactions:  

1. **User Experience Criticism (mdmsmrt)**: Users criticize intrusive consent banners (e.g., cookie pop-ups) that block content, with a 25% premium subscription offer framed as a "beautiful red cover." These banners are seen as aggressive, potentially manipulating users into paying to avoid disruptions. A subcomment (SOLAR_FIELDS) notes technical flaws, such as unclosable pop-ups due to CSS issues, exacerbating frustration.  

2. **Agreement with Process (billy99k)**: A brief acknowledgment ("prcs") likely signals agreement with the critique of dark patterns in web design.  

3. **Fictional Parallels (fnlysn, aaron695)**: Users reference *Daemon* by Daniel Suarez, a novel about a rogue AI causing chaos, drawing parallels to the submission’s warnings about AI agents in cybersecurity. The response "true" and "dd" (Daemon reference) underscores concerns that speculative fiction may be becoming reality.  

**Summary**: The comments highlight frustration with manipulative web design tactics, technical flaws in consent mechanisms, and apprehension about AI agents evolving into existential threats akin to those in dystopian fiction.
