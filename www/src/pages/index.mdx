Hugging Face has officially acquired XetHub, a Seattle-based startup founded by former Apple engineers Yucheng Low, Ajit Banerjee, and Rajat Arya. XetHub specializes in optimizing Git for large-scale AI development, enhancing collaboration, and managing extensive datasets and models. With their expertise, the XetHub team aims to revolutionize how Hugging Face handles massive AI files, moving away from Git LFS to a more efficient storage backend that leverages chunked uploads and deduplication. This upgrade means, for example, that instead of re-uploading a hefty 10GB file to add a single row, users will only need to upload the new data chunks. 

The integration promises to facilitate better collaboration across growing models and datasets — as AI continues to push boundaries with trillion-parameter models. Hugging Face's infrastructure will further empower its extensive community, which currently boasts over 1.3 million repositories containing 12PB of data. Enthusiastic about the future, XetHub founders express their commitment to making AI development smoother and more collaborative in the evolving landscape. And if you're passionate about this mission, XetHub's new org page is actively hiring to expand their team!

The discussion surrounding the acquisition of XetHub by Hugging Face primarily revolves around the challenges of managing large datasets in Git. Users expressed concerns about the limitations of Git LFS, noting that it doesn’t effectively handle large files and can complicate data storage and retrieval processes. Some highlighted the potential benefits of XetHub's advanced storage backend, which could improve efficiency with chunked uploads and better collaboration in the future.

Discussion participants also mentioned the need for local data storage solutions for managing large repositories, and there were references to existing implementations and resources, including Git repositories that potentially integrate with XetHub’s technology. Overall, the conversation reflected an optimistic view of XetHub’s capability to address the specific needs of AI developers working with substantial datasets, while critically examining the current limitations of Git LFS.
