### Chain-of-thought can hurt performance on tasks where thinking makes humans worse

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21333) | 333 points | by [benocodes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benocodes) | [212 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41999340)

A new paper titled "Mind Your Step (by Step): Chain-of-Thought can Reduce Performance on Tasks where Thinking Makes Humans Worse" explores the intricacies of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in machine learning models. Authored by Ryan Liu and colleagues, the research investigates scenarios where CoT—often beneficial in enhancing model performance—actually leads to significant performance drops. Drawing parallels from cognitive psychology, the authors highlight tasks like implicit statistical learning and visual recognition, where deliberation may hinder human performance, and surprisingly, similar effects are observed in advanced language models, experiencing up to a 36.3% decline in accuracy compared to their zero-shot counterparts. Their findings suggest that while the cognitive mechanisms of humans and models are not perfectly aligned, understanding when and how thinking negatively affects performance can refine our approach to model prompting and reasoning processes. This insightful intersection of human cognitive behavior with AI evaluation offers a fresh lens on the complexities of prompt choices in machine learning tasks.

The discussion surrounding the paper "Mind Your Step (by Step)" delves into the implications of chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting in machine learning, revealing it may actually hinder performance in specific tasks. Participants express a mix of skepticism and curiosity, debating the cognitive analogies between human reasoning and AI language models (LLMs).

Key points of contention revolve around whether LLMs' token prediction capabilities accurately reflect human-like reasoning processes. Some commenters argue that LLMs simply manipulate text based on statistical patterns, lacking genuine understanding, while others believe LLMs display advanced and emergent behavior akin to human cognition under certain conditions.

Several comments explore the idea that overthinking, or positional clarity in prompting, may confuse both humans and models in complex scenarios, echoing the paper's findings. Participants express curiosity about implications for designing better prompting strategies for LLMs, especially in high-stakes situations where precision is critical.

Amidst this, some voices suggest that reducing the reliance on CoT in prompt design could potentially enhance model performance, as excessive deliberation may lead to errors—not just in AI but also in human reasoning. Overall, the discussion illustrates a broader concern within the AI research community about reconciling LLM capabilities with human cognitive processes, emphasizing the need for careful consideration in model deployment and the continuing exploration of AI's relationship with human intelligence.
