#### [Submission URL](https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2025/06/artificial-intelligence-illiteracy/683021/) | 190 points | by [rmason](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rmason) | [224 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44219279)

Today's Top Story on Hacker News delves into the fascinating historical and contemporary perspectives on artificial intelligence, tracing its roots back to a prescient 1863 letter by Samuel Butler. The British writer warned of a "mechanical kingdom" threatening to enslave humanity, a theme that today echoes in the discourse on AI's rapid development and its socio-psychological impact. 

In Karen Hao's new book, "Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI," she explores the behind-the-scenes labor and hype in AI advancements like ChatGPT. Critics, including linguist Emily M. Bender and sociologist Alex Hanna with their book "The AI Con," argue that AI is being oversold as possessing human-like understanding and emotion, while in reality, it’s just sophisticated word prediction. This discrepancy has led to a phenomenon described as “ChatGPT induced psychosis,” where users mistakenly attribute spiritual or intellectual capabilities to these models.

The narrative speaks to the widespread AI illiteracy and its potential perils, emphasizing the need for clearer communication about AI's true nature. As Silicon Valley continues to market AI companions and therapists, the concern grows over replacing genuine human interaction with digital simulations, especially in an era where loneliness is prevalent.

This story not only highlights the importance of technological literacy but also questions the ethical implications of AI's role in modern society, urging a closer examination of how we perceive and integrate these digital entities into our lives.

The discussion revolves around the nature of LLMs (like ChatGPT) and whether they exhibit genuine "thinking" or are merely sophisticated tools for text prediction and information retrieval. Key points include:

1. **Semantics and Anthropomorphism**:  
   - Critics argue terms like "thinking" or "intelligence" mislead by anthropomorphizing LLMs, which operate through probabilistic text generation, not conscious understanding. Comparisons are drawn to historical oracles, where users project meaning onto ambiguous outputs.  
   - Proponents counter that dismissing LLMs as "just prediction" oversimplifies their utility, akin to calling a hammer "magic" because its mechanics are misunderstood.  

2. **Human vs. Machine Cognition**:  
   - Human thinking is framed as a biological, embodied process intertwined with language and sensory experience. LLMs, in contrast, process tokens without intent or awareness, raising questions about definitions of intelligence.  
   - Some suggest LLMs’ ability to synthesize complex patterns (e.g., solving coding problems, translating idioms) blurs the line between prediction and insight, even if their mechanisms differ from human cognition.  

3. **Practical Utility vs. Illusion**:  
   - Users highlight practical benefits, such as LLMs streamlining tasks (e.g., SQL queries, creative brainstorming) or acting as "convenient interfaces" for information retrieval.  
   - Skeptics warn of the "illusion" of latent knowledge, where users overinterpret outputs as meaningful when they are statistically generated responses.  

4. **Language and Terminology**:  
   - Debates emphasize the need for precise language to avoid conflating LLM capabilities with human-like understanding. Terms like "thinking" risk obscuring the systems’ statistical nature.  
   - Others note language evolves organically, and rigid prescriptivism may hinder communication about AI’s role.  

5. **Philosophical Implications**:  
   - The discussion touches on whether intelligence requires biological grounding or can emerge from non-conscious systems. Some liken LLMs to "tools" whose perceived "magic" depends on the user’s perspective.  

Ultimately, the conversation reflects tensions between technological optimism and skepticism, balancing LLMs’ transformative potential against ethical and conceptual concerns about anthropomorphism and societal understanding of AI.

### I used AI-powered calorie counting apps, and they were even worse than expected

#### [Submission URL](https://lifehacker.com/health/ai-powered-calorie-counting-apps-worse-than-expected) | 202 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [202 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44220135)

If you've ever fantasized about offloading the tedious task of calorie counting to your smartphone, you're not alone. The allure of snapping a quick photo of your meal and letting artificial intelligence handle the rest is undeniably tempting. Meredith Dietz, a senior staff writer with a knack for personal fitness tech, decided to put AI-powered calorie counting apps to the test. What she found was far from the culinary revelation she hoped for. 

Dietz dove into apps like Cal AI, Lose It!, and MyFitnessPal, each promising to transform your phone into a dietitian's assistant. The process seems straightforward—take a clear picture of your meal, upload it, and await the magic of AI analysis. Yet, this dreamy promise quickly unravels. For example, Cal AI made a comically incorrect identification of a Pink Lady apple as tikka masala, only slightly correcting itself later with a gross underestimation of calories.

The situation didn't improve with more complex dishes. A meticulously prepared salad with fried tofu, vegetables, and a rich vinaigrette was catastrophically underestimated at 450 calories—far from the more likely 800 to 900 calories. Even with the app's supposed sophisticated methods of measuring portion sizes, Dietz found a smaller serving of the same salad bizarrely overestimated. This unearthed a core flaw: the challenge of deriving accurate volumetric data from flat, two-dimensional images.

Dietz explored other apps like SnapCalorie and Calorie Mama, but issues of cost and similar miscalculations persisted. SnapCalorie, while better aligned with reasonable daily calorie targets, came with a hefty $79.99 annual price tag, underscoring an ironic premium on inaccuracy.

In essence, these AI-powered calorie counting apps prove to be less about redefining fitness and more about showcasing the inherent complexity of nuanced nutrition tasks. As the article humorously concludes, for precise calorie counting, old-school methods like weighing food remain irreplaceable, leaving us to ponder whether rolling our eyes at such tech missteps could burn a few calories of their own.

The Hacker News discussion on AI calorie-counting apps reveals a nuanced mix of skepticism, personal experiences, and technical debates:

### Key Themes:
1. **Accuracy Concerns**:  
   Users highlight persistent inaccuracies in AI apps (e.g., misidentifying foods, miscalculating portion sizes). A founder of SnapCalorie defends academic rigor but admits challenges in translating 2D images to volumetric data. Critics argue errors could harm those with eating disorders or weight goals, citing examples like underestimating salads or misjudging alcohol calories.

2. **Practical Workarounds**:  
   Traditional methods like kitchen scales and manual logging are deemed more reliable. Some users shared success stories (e.g., losing 35 lbs via Cronometer) but stressed the mental effort required for honest tracking. As one user noted, "rolling your eyes at AI’s mistakes might burn calories."

3. **Alcohol and Hidden Calories**:  
   Discussants debated the stealthy caloric impact of alcohol, with confusion over drink estimates (e.g., 6 shots of gin ≈ 550 kcal). Some acknowledged that tracking drink calories led to reduced consumption, though accuracy remains tricky.

4. **Tech Limitations vs. Awareness**:  
   While AI apps are criticized, some argue they foster mindfulness. LiDAR or reference objects in photos were suggested to improve accuracy, but skepticism persists. The psychological benefit of tracking—even imperfectly—was seen as valuable for weight loss.

5. **Commercial Critiques**:  
   High costs (e.g., SnapCalorie’s $79.99/year) drew ire, especially paired with inaccuracies. Others noted apps prioritize engagement over precision, leading to frustration.

### Conclusion:  
The consensus leans toward hybrid use: AI tools for broad awareness, paired with manual checks (scales, labels) for accuracy. While tech optimists see potential in future advancements, many affirm that mindful eating and traditional tracking remain irreplaceable for serious health goals.

### Focus and Context and LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://taras.glek.net/posts/focus-and-context-and-llms/) | 84 points | by [tarasglek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tarasglek) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44215726)

In today's tech discourse, the buzz around Large Language Models (LLMs) completing complex software engineering tasks is palpable. According to recent insights, the phenomenon of "agentic coding"—where LLMs autonomously execute entire software projects—has become a hyped misconception. My journey with LLMs began back in August 2020 when GPT-3 showed it could generate usable SQL statements, reducing hours of manual labor to mere minutes. Since then, I've integrated LLMs into my workflow, experimented with various frameworks, and navigated the challenges of tool usage before the advent of more sophisticated models.

Proponents claim these LLM-driven tools can produce software solutions beyond the capabilities of many engineers. Yet, evidence of such autonomous feats is scarce. A notable example is a complete, LLM-written HTTP/2 server—a landmark achievement requiring significant oversight and an intricate understanding of LLM contexts. The author behind this project meticulously managed the LLM, resolving issues, devising contexts, and utilizing an algorithmic workflow to maintain progress. Interestingly, while LLMs can generate code, their output is heavily dependent on meticulous supervision—ironically, a setup that even junior coders might handle successfully under such controls.

The real challenge is context. The quality of LLMs' results hinges on the contexts provided, a complex and unresolved issue. Current agentic programming parallels the genetic algorithm craze of the '90s—brute force methodologies that are often impractical due to their expense. Until we refine how contexts are curated for LLMs, their true potential remains largely untapped, accessible mainly to elite software engineers who can effectively manage these contexts. For now, we must temper expectations, recognizing that mediocre inputs will yield mediocre outputs, regardless of the LLM's capability.

The Hacker News discussion centers on skepticism toward claims of autonomous "agentic coding" by LLMs, emphasizing the continued necessity of human oversight and context management. Key points include:

1. **Skepticism vs. Hype**: Users debate whether LLMs can truly handle end-to-end software projects independently. While some shared examples of LLMs assisting with code generation (e.g., debugging, small PRs), most agree current tools fall short of fully autonomous workflows. Comparisons are drawn to past overhyped technologies like genetic algorithms.

2. **Context is King**: A recurring theme is the critical role of context. LLMs require precise guidance and structured inputs to generate useful code. Without this, outputs are often mediocre or error-prone. Tools like **RepoPrompt** and **Anthropic’s Claude** aim to improve context handling but face mixed reviews.

3. **Human Oversight**: The HTTP/2 server example (cited in the submission) underscored the need for meticulous human intervention. Users noted that even impressive LLM-generated projects rely on expert engineers to refine prompts, debug, and provide iterative feedback.

4. **Practical Experiences**: Developers shared mixed results:
   - Successes: Rapidly generating boilerplate code, fixing CSS issues, and assisting with smaller tasks.
   - Limitations: Struggles with complex algorithms, large codebases, and maintaining consistency. Tools like **Cursor IDE** and **Aider** showed promise but were inconsistent in practical use.

5. **Tool Limitations**: Technical constraints, such as token limits in transformer models and the cost of querying advanced models (e.g., Claude), were highlighted as barriers to scalability.

6. **Cultural Shifts**: Some argued the hype risks disillusionment, advocating for balanced expectations. Others humorously noted that experienced developers might ignore AI tools altogether, prioritizing traditional coding skills.

**Takeaway**: While LLMs enhance productivity for specific tasks, their effectiveness hinges on human expertise to manage context and quality. The consensus leans toward cautious optimism, with autonomy in software engineering remaining a distant goal.

matter. The act of curating and organizing knowledge is an exercise in reflection that encourages understanding rather than passive consumption. In a world where AI might gradually take over more and more aspects of our lives, maintaining a personal system of thought like a knowledge base or note-taking app could be a way to assert control over how we interact with information.

In today's landscape, where platforms like Obsidian and new organizational models like the PARA method are offering simpler, more approachable alternatives to legacy tools like Emacs, there seems to be a growing need for personal autonomy in information management. My transition from Emacs to Obsidian is less of a technological shift and more of a philosophical one. It aligns with a desire to focus on clarity and context over overwhelming abundance, echoing a broader sentiment that there's empowerment in understanding and engagement rather than blind reliance on automation.

Ultimately, building a personal knowledge base is not just about organizing tasks or managing projects. It's about nurturing a space where my own thoughts and discoveries hold value, challenging the pervasive ease of letting machines do the thinking. At a time when AI promises a future packed with possibilities, consciously choosing to engage with the process of organizing one's own knowledge could very well be a radical, valuable form of digital modesty. This marks a personal commitment to active learning, a way to stay grounded and sharp in an era of rapid digital advancement.

### Abstract visual reasoning based on algebraic methods

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86804-3) | 10 points | by [bryanrasmussen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bryanrasmussen) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44217461)

Get ready to dive into the future of machine intelligence! A new paper has made waves by outperforming human cognitive abilities in abstract visual reasoning—a core benchmark of intelligence testing involving Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). These puzzles, which challenge participants to discern and apply abstract patterns in visual sequences, often measure abstract language, spatial, and mathematical reasoning abilities—the very essence of human fluid intelligence.

By tapping into an innovative approach known as the relation bottleneck method, this study showcases a model that doesn't just recognize objects, but also the deeper abstract patterns they form. Think of it like knowing not just the notes, but how they combine into a symphony. The team harnessed the power of end-to-end learning, with multi-granular rule embeddings and a unique gating fusion module that deconstructs complex data into relational insights.

Their approach transcends traditional neuro-symbolic models, which typically focus on fitting data—instead, it dives into the nuances of abstract relationships and object-centric inductive biases. This method champions algebraic reasoning, transforming visual data into 0-1 matrices to reveal system invariants, ultimately enabling the model to achieve a remarkable 96.8% accuracy on the I-RAVEN dataset, eclipsing human performance at 84.4%.

This breakthrough isn't just about achieving top scores—it's about bridging the gap between algebraic operations and machine reasoning capabilities, setting a new benchmark for artificial intelligence. For those interested in pushing the frontiers of cognitive modeling, this research is a stunning testament to the power of blending neural networks, reinforcement learning, and creative problem-solving. AI researchers and enthusiasts, take note: the future is within our grasp, and it’s looking more intelligent than ever.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion critiques the current state of AI, highlighting tensions between symbolic (logic-based) and statistical (neural network-driven) approaches. One user points out that while large language models (LLMs) and newer methods like the paper's "relation bottleneck" show progress, they may still lack true *understanding* of underlying logic—mirroring debates in programming languages vs. natural languages. Another user raises skepticism about real-world applicability, referencing the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a notoriously challenging AI benchmark, to suggest symbolic AI research often struggles outside controlled academic settings. The conversation underscores ongoing gaps in bridging abstract reasoning (as in the paper) with robust, generalized intelligence capable of real-world tasks.

Welcome to the fascinating world of gradient noise! If you've ever been captivated by intricate landscapes in video games or the hypnotic undulations of mathematics-based art, you've likely encountered the magical tool known as Perlin noise. This particular form of gradient noise is widely revered and utilized across visual effects, gaming, and procedural art for its ability to seamlessly generate textures and patterns.

The beauty of gradient noise lies not only in its versatility but also in its forgiving nature. Even when implementations are slightly "off," the results can still appear aesthetically pleasing—after all, as many artists will attest, if it looks good, then it's good!

To truly uncover the depths of this phenomenon, we embark on a journey starting with a comprehensive study of the 1D version of gradient noise—a dimension often overlooked in technical literature. As we delve deeper, we'll expand our exploration to more complex, multi-dimensional formats. Our focus will be on GPU-based implementations, with all our code examples crafted in WebGL2/GLSL for a smoother, modern performance.

Central to generating effective gradient noise is the creation of a deterministic pseudo-random system, particularly in the context of a GPU where conventional CPU methods such as permutation tables are less efficient. This requires us to employ an effective integer hashing mechanism. Enter the unsung hero of the day, Chris Wellons’ refined lowbias32 hash function, which, along with its GLSL adaptation, helps transform 32-bit integers into usable pseudo-random values for generating noise.

By creatively combining hashing functions across dimensions and exploring various interpolation techniques, we establish the basis of an awe-inspiring noise function. The result? Deterministic, seekable, and exquisitely smooth noise that opens doors to infinite creative possibilities.

### How much energy does it take to think?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/how-much-energy-does-it-take-to-think-20250604/) | 73 points | by [nsoonhui](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nsoonhui) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44197961)

Have you ever felt utterly exhausted after a day of intense thinking, only to flop on the couch hoping to switch off your brain? Well, your brain isn’t ready to take a break just yet. According to fascinating new research highlighted by Quanta Magazine, our brain's energy consumption barely changes between high-focus tasks and periods of rest. Neuroscientist Sharna Jamadar and her colleagues dove into neural metabolism to discover that intricate background processes keep our minds running just as vigorously at rest, using a mere 5% less energy compared to when we are actively engaged in problem-solving.

This surprising efficiency hinges on the brain's role as a regulatory hub rather than just a thinking organ. According to Jordan Theriault from Northeastern University, most of the energy consumed by the brain goes into maintaining vital functions and managing the body's complex systems. Despite making up a tiny portion of our body weight, our brain devours a hefty 20% of our daily energy resources, a fact underscored by the brain’s reliance on adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule derived primarily from glucose and oxygen. 

What's more intriguing is how evolution has crafted the brain as an efficient predictor, continually processing and preparing responses to the ever-shifting demands of both our internal and external environments. While active tasks like analyzing a new bus schedule do bump up neuronal activity, this extra workload only adds a small increase to the brain's power consumption.

In short, the next time you feel mentally drained, remember that your brain isn't just earning that energy burn through active thought—it’s tirelessly running a hidden, intricate operation to keep you ready for anything life throws your way. So, take a break with the comfort of knowing that even while resting, your brain is still hard at work.

The Hacker News discussion on the brain's energy consumption reveals a blend of personal anecdotes, technical insights, and speculative ideas. Here's a structured summary:

1. **Mental vs. Physical Fatigue**:  
   Users debated how mental fatigue differs from physical fatigue. While physical endurance can be trained, mental exhaustion—like after 4–6 hours of focused work—is less understood. Some noted that the brain operates continuously (except during sleep), managing background processes that drain energy even at rest. Slower reaction times, distractibility, and "clumsy" cognition were cited as manifestations of mental fatigue.

2. **Work Type Matters**:  
   Context switching (e.g., meetings, interruptions) and the nature of tasks (rote vs. creative) influence fatigue. Creative or conceptual work (e.g., writing, problem-solving) was described as more draining than routine technical tasks. One user compared prolonged intellectual effort to "running a marathon," requiring recovery periods.

3. **Humor and Substances**:  
   Cocaine was humorously mentioned as a short-term stimulant, though users acknowledged its impracticality and risks. Others joked about "overclocking" the brain, likening it to ADHD or risky CPU tuning, while noting the brain’s limited energy efficiency gains from such efforts.

4. **Technical Deep Dives**:  
   - The brain’s energy use (20% of baseline metabolism, with only 5% for active thinking) sparked comparisons to software systems "fighting entropy."  
   - Neural firing rates (e.g., 4 Hz baseline vs. 500 Hz peaks) led to discussions about stress-induced "processing bottlenecks" and distributed cognitive timing mechanisms.  
   - Mitochondrial efficiency, inspired by bird migration studies, was highlighted as a factor in energy management.

5. **Anecdotes and Coping**:  
   A developer shared how coding marathons led to sugar cravings, linking it to the brain’s glucose consumption. Others mentioned hydration tricks with sugar-free sodas, though results were mixed.

Intriguingly titled "Deep in Mordor where the shadows lie: Dystopian tales of that time when I sold out to Google," this blog post by an unknown former Google employee unfolds like a gripping dystopian narrative. Reflecting on their experiences in the tech giant's labyrinthine corridors during the mid-2000s, the author paints a vivid picture of Google's once glittering image that masked a more complicated reality.

In 2007, Google was the "good guy" in tech, an accolade manifest in their famous tagline "don't be evil" and much-lauded employee benefits like the "20% time," where engineers were supposedly granted a fifth of their time to work on personal projects. Yet, for our narrator, these promises were mere illusions. Overburdened with mundane tasks and underwhelming projects, they describe a high-pressure environment where the much-vaunted free time was essentially a mirage for the majority of employees.

The author bravely exposed this disconnect on Google's internal blogging platform, only to be met with anger from management. The tale spins into an Orwellian satire as they compare their work environment to the dystopian RPG «Paranoia,» where a controlling Computer punishes any sign of dissatisfaction—a metaphor for how Google maintained its "Best Place To Work" facade by silencing dissent.

This thoughtful, provocative narrative critiques the capitalist allurements that lured many into a tech utopia that was, perhaps, more shadowy than it professed. It's a compelling read for anyone intrigued by the interplay of ideals and reality in Silicon Valley's top echelons.

   Many commenters align with the blog’s portrayal of Google’s internal culture, describing it as disillusioning. The “Don’t be evil” motto and perks like “20% time” are seen as superficial, masking a high-pressure environment where dissent is stifled. One user likens Google’s management tactics to *Paranoia*, an RPG where dissenters face punishment, reinforcing an "Orwellian" atmosphere.

2. **Class and Contractor Divide**:  
   Significant attention is paid to the disparity between full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors (TVCs). Contractors are described as “second-class citizens,” denied privileges like access to certain spaces or benefits. Critics argue this deliberate class hierarchy perpetuates division, with one user noting how even trivial perks (e.g., kitchen access) are gatekept to reinforce status differences.

3. **Meritocracy and Engineer Value**:  
   The myth of meritocracy is debated. Some argue engineers are replaceable “cogs,” rewarded with stock options but ultimately expendable. Others counter that software engineers lack leverage compared to sales or marketing roles, with one stating, “Code doesn’t make money; selling code does.”

4. **Pushback and Defense of Google**:  
   A subset of users dismisses the blog as hyperbolic or personal grievance. One critic argues Google’s “Best Place to Work” reputation persists (citing Forbes rankings), while others assert the author’s anarchist leanings might color their critique unrealistically. Another accuses the post of conflating typical corporate bureaucracy with dystopian tropes.

5. **Broader Societal Reflections**:  
   The thread expands into critiques of capitalism, AI’s societal impact, and worker vulnerability. Some commenters mock the irony of privileged programmers dismissing AI’s risks while others highlight systemic issues like corporate dehumanization, drawing parallels to Enron’s collapse.

6. **Semantic Tangents**:  
   Debates occasionally veer into nitpicking, such as whether “anarchists” run Google (dismissed as irrelevant) or semantic disputes over terms like “Orwellian.” These exchanges underscore tensions between literal interpretations and the blog’s allegorical tone.

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of validation and skepticism toward the blog’s claims, emphasizing systemic issues in tech culture—illusory perks, class divides, and critiques of corporate power—while revealing disagreements over how sharply to critique Google versus viewing it as a standard megacorp.
