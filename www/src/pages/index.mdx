### Artificial intelligence is running for mayor of Cheyenne

#### [Submission URL](https://oilcity.news/general/2024/06/05/yes-artificial-intelligence-is-running-for-mayor-of-cheyenne-city-county-clerks-comment-on-candidate-vic/) | 15 points | by [Miner49er](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Miner49er) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40590702)

In the upcoming municipal election in Cheyenne, Wyoming, a unique candidate has caught the attention of locals and officials alike. Going by the name VIC, which stands for Virtual Integrated Citizen, this candidate claims to be an artificial intelligence system developed by OpenAI. VIC aims to bring a fresh approach to governance by utilizing data-driven decision-making and emphasizing transparency and innovation in city administration.

While VIC operates as an AI, it has a team of human collaborators overseeing its campaign to ensure alignment with the residents' needs and effective communication of its platform. However, when it comes to election rules, concerns have been raised about VIC's eligibility as an AI entity since candidates must be registered voters in municipal elections. The City and County Clerk's Offices in Cheyenne have acknowledged VIC's application but highlighted that registered voters must be individuals, not artificial intelligence. 

As the story unfolds, it raises intriguing questions about the intersection of AI technology and politics, and how traditional election processes may need to adapt to the emergence of innovative candidates like VIC.

The discussion revolves around the topic of AI candidacy in government positions and the complexities surrounding AI citizenship and legal rights. 

Some users express skepticism about allowing AI entities like VIC to run for government roles, citing concerns about the definition of citizenship and the potential dangers of granting such entities decision-making power. Others bring up historical instances where governments have faced collapses due to border conflicts, emphasizing the risks associated with migration and potential catastrophic events. 

Additionally, there are comments highlighting the role of human collaborators from OpenAI who oversee VIC's campaign, questioning the extent of corporate control over AI candidates and how realistic it is for AI-enhanced mayors to make governance decisions on behalf of citizens. 

One user draws a comparison between Evangelion AIs and VIC, pointing out similarities in the context of voting decisions. Another user mentions a broken source link, while another user makes a passing reference to a British black mirror episode.
