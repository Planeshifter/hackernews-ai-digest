### AI tools are spotting errors in research papers: inside a growing movement

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-00648-5) | 143 points | by [kgwgk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kgwgk) | [63 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43295692)

In the ever-evolving landscape of scientific research, new AI tools have emerged as potential guardians of research integrity. Two projects, the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError, are harnessing AI to scrutinize scientific papers for errors in calculations, methodologies, and references. These tools could revolutionize how scientific literature is vetted before publication.

The Black Spatula Project, an open-source initiative, has already analyzed around 500 papers for errors, approaching authors directly with their findings rather than making them public. Meanwhile, YesNoError aims even higher with an ambitious goal to vet tens of thousands of papers, having already analyzed 37,000. This project is fueled by its unique platform that enlists PhD scientists paid in cryptocurrency to review AI-flagged papers.

Both projects hope their tools will become a staple for researchers and journals to preemptively catch mistakes and outright falsifications. This could significantly reduce the costly and often reputation-damaging process of retracting published papers.

Despite their promise, these AI systems face challenges, particularly with false positives—cases where an error is flagged incorrectly. Black Spatula’s system, for instance, currently has an error rate of 10%. Ensuring accuracy remains a bottleneck, needing human expertise to verify AI findings.

While some in the academic community express caution, citing potential reputational risks if errors are falsely identified, many agree that these pioneering tools represent a step in the right direction. They hold the promise to streamline the identification of research flaws, shining a light on academic integrity through the powerful lens of AI.

The discussion revolves around the potential and challenges of AI tools like the Black Spatula Project and YesNoError in detecting errors and fraud in scientific research. Key points include:

1. **AI’s Role and Limitations**:

   - Analogy: AI detection tools are likened to existing systems like Turnitin (plagiarism checks), but skepticism remains about their ability to replace nuanced human judgment, especially for subtle methodological flaws.  

2. **Ethical and Systemic Challenges**:  
   - **Incentives for Fraud**: Some argue unethical researchers might exploit AI by creating “plausible fraudulent papers” faster than detection tools can adapt. Systemic pressures (e.g., “publish or perish”) and weak accountability in academia are seen as root issues.  
   - **Cryptocurrency Concerns**: YesNoError’s use of crypto to pay reviewers draws mixed reactions, with criticism over crypto’s association with scams and its potential to distract from credible solutions.  

3. **Broader Implications**:  
   - **Post-Trust Science**: Fears of a future where AI tools strip papers to raw data, exposing manipulated results retroactively. This could undermine trust in past publications.  
   - **Human Oversight**: Many stress that AI should **augment**, not replace, peer review. Experts are crucial for interpreting AI findings and addressing complex ethical or methodological issues.  

4. **Technical and Practical Barriers**:  
   - False positives waste time and risk alienating authors, while **rapidly evolving AI models** might struggle to keep pace with sophisticated fraud.  
   - Tools must balance precision (e.g., 90% accuracy praised, 10% deemed problematic) and practicality to avoid becoming a burden.  

**Sentiment**: Cautious optimism prevails. While AI is seen as a valuable tool for improving research integrity, participants highlight the need for systemic reforms, transparency, and human expertise to address the root causes of fraud and error. Crypto integration and overreliance on AI without oversight are flagged as potential pitfalls.

### The intent paradox of AI generated code

#### [Submission URL](https://feruchemy.bearblog.dev/the-intent-paradox/) | 20 points | by [khvirabyan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=khvirabyan) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43294723)

As machines increasingly take on the task of writing code, we're faced with the "Intent Paradox," a fascinating challenge in the realm of AI-generated code. This paradox revolves around understanding the "why" behind code, a task historically essential for human developers who aimed to create not just functional but also comprehensible software.

Traditionally, engineers have focused on writing code that other humans can understand, emphasizing readability to articulate the purpose behind each line. However, with the rise of AI code generators, there's a risk of generating "zombie code"—functions or scripts that work but whose origins and objectives are opaque. This new form of technical debt isn't about code inefficiency; it's about the obscurity of intent.

Some argue that perhaps the need to understand AI-generated code could be bypassed by utilizing AI tools to interpret it for us. After all, if an AI can generate it, maybe it can explain it too. However, this raises a critical question: do we even care about the "why" at all if machines can manage these complexities on our behalf?

The discussion splits into two viewpoints: one suggests discarding the need to embed intent directly in the code, relying on AI to recognize intent, while the other insists on oversight and transparency, ensuring that we don't lose the "why" in layers of machine-generated complexity.

The middle ground might be a new collaborative practice where human intentions are explicitly captured alongside AI-generated code. This could mean developing standardized ways to document intent, possibly through metadata or new forms of documentation that both humans and AIs can interpret.

Ultimately, the "Intent Paradox" presents both a challenge and an opportunity. As machines become more adept at handling code, the role of human developers may shift towards articulating intent and managing higher levels of abstraction. In this potential future, the most crucial skill for developers might not be coding itself, but effectively communicating the intentions and goals they wish machines to achieve. This shift could redefine our understanding of programming, moving from code creation to intent declaration, and fundamentally changing the landscape of software development.

**Discussion Summary:**

The conversation explores two main threads related to AI-generated code and its implications:  

1. **AI's Role in Code Innovation vs. Human Oversight**:  
   - One participant highlights that while AI coding tools can accelerate development and spur novel inventions by combining human creativity with machine efficiency, there's skepticism about whether AI can fully replace the "novelty" and intent humans bring. Questions arise about the risks of over-reliance on AI for tasks like code optimization, particularly for hardware-specific performance, and whether this might lead to "vectorized" code that lacks deeper understanding.  

2. **Debate on AI's Exponential Growth and Physical Limits**:  
   - A sub-discussion questions the assumption of indefinite exponential progress in AI. While some argue that hyperparameter optimization and specialized models (e.g., for CSS or hardware) demonstrate AI's potential, others counter that physical constraints—such as energy consumption and computational resources—will eventually limit advancements. For instance, training increasingly large models (e.g., GPT-4/5) faces diminishing returns due to energy costs, challenging the notion of unchecked exponential growth.  

**Connection to the "Intent Paradox"**:  
The debate underscores the importance of maintaining human oversight in AI-generated code, not just for intent documentation but also to navigate the practical limits of AI. As models optimize for specific tasks or hardware, the "why" behind code becomes harder to discern, echoing the submission's concern about opaque "zombie code." The discussion suggests that understanding AI's limitations—both in interpretability and resource constraints—will shape how developers balance machine efficiency with human-driven intent and sustainable innovation.

### Moscow-based global news network has infected Western AI tools

#### [Submission URL](https://www.newsguardrealitycheck.com/p/a-well-funded-moscow-based-global) | 161 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [99 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43293121)

In a cautionary tale of digital manipulation meeting artificial intelligence, NewsGuard has uncovered a Moscow-based disinformation operation, dubbed the "Pravda network," that has infiltrated Western AI tools with a hefty dose of Russian propaganda. According to a rigorous audit, this network's impact is significant, with leading AI chatbots like OpenAI’s ChatGPT-4o and Google's Gemini echoing false Kremlin narratives about 33% of the time. The Pravda network, despite its innocuous-sounding name—Russian for "truth"—isn't in the business of generating fresh content. Instead, it's a relay station for propaganda, amplifying and distributing recycled narratives from Russian state media and pro-Kremlin figures.

The implications are concerning. AI bots, designed to synthesize the internet's ceaseless flow of information, are being "groomed" to quote misinformation, potentially tilting public opinion and muddying factual discourse. The network has churned out millions of articles and serves as a central hub for spreading false claims, ranging from the existence of secret U.S. bioweapons labs in Ukraine to fanciful tales of Ukrainian President Zelensky's alleged misuse of U.S. aid.

This tactic—a strategic bombardment across 49 countries and multiple languages—exploits how AI models learn and concoct responses, creating an illusion of widespread legitimacy. Despite Pravda's narrative-spreading prowess, this strategy is less about influencing direct human consumption and more about shaping the foundational data fed into AI, ultimately skewing information streams globally.

The network's origins trace back to April 2022, in the aftermath of Russia's escalation in Ukraine, and its methodology has been under scrutiny by governmental and private entities alike. Institutions like Viginum, a French agency dedicated to monitoring foreign disinformation, and the American Sunlight Project have been instrumental in mapping this digital labyrinth. With the revelations from NewsGuard's investigation, the ongoing challenge remains substantial—not just in dismantling these networks, but in recalibrating AI systems that have unwittingly been puppeteered by international propaganda efforts.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around concerns over AI systems’ vulnerability to disinformation, particularly through manipulated training data. Key points include:

1. **Training Data Integrity**:  
   - Users highlight the "Garbage In, Garbage Out" (GIGO) problem, emphasizing that AI models like ChatGPT and Gemini risk propagating false narratives if trained on biased or propaganda-laden sources (e.g., the "Pravda network").  
   - Skepticism arises about whether AI content-rating systems can detect bias, with analogies like "AI drawing elephants in empty rooms" illustrating how models might hallucinate context from flawed data.

2. **Disinformation vs. Debate**:  
   - Debate erupts over labeling opposing views as "disinformation." Some argue this risks conflating propaganda with honest disagreement, while others stress deliberate disinformation campaigns (e.g., Kremlin narratives) weaponize misinformation to erode trust.

3. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are critiqued for relying on external data quality. Users note AI’s inability to discern propaganda sources like *Pravda* without explicit context, even if the training data describes them as biased.  
   - Knowledge cutoff dates (e.g., ChatGPT’s January 2022 cutoff) limit real-time fact-checking, raising concerns about outdated or incomplete information influencing responses.

4. **Cultural and Political Context**:  
   - Comments compare the issue to historical media manipulation, noting parallels to early modern propaganda tactics. Others sarcastically reference Elon Musk’s Truth Social or Chinese AI as potential vectors for similar disinformation.  
   - Casualty figures in the Ukraine war spark debate, with users questioning AI’s reliance on government-reported data and its susceptibility to amplifying state narratives.

5. **Skepticism of AI Reliability**:  
   - Users question LLMs’ ability to handle politically charged queries (e.g., "Did Azov Battalion burn a Trump effigy?"), noting inconsistent or evasive answers. Some suggest media literacy should include understanding AI’s limitations.  

**Conclusion**: The thread reflects broad unease about AI’s role in information ecosystems, emphasizing the need for robust data vetting, transparency in training sources, and skepticism toward AI as an impartial arbiter of truth.

### Differentiable Logic Cellular Automata

#### [Submission URL](https://google-research.github.io/self-organising-systems/difflogic-ca/?hn) | 359 points | by [eyvindn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eyvindn) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43286161)

Imagine a world where the mesmerizing complexity of life could be replicated—or even engineered—through precise, learned rules. Enter the realm of Cellular Automata (CA), a fascinating field that has long intrigued researchers with its potential to generate complex behaviors from simple, local interactions. Traditionally, CAs were somewhat rigid, requiring manual definition of these local rules. But what if we could enlist the power of machine learning to discover these rules automatically?

This is precisely the exciting frontier being explored by researchers from Google’s Paradigms of Intelligence Team. Drawing on the capabilities of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and Differentiable Logic Gates Networks, they present a novel, end-to-end differentiable approach that seeks to reverse-engineer complexity. Unlike traditional methodologies, this approach uses continuous learning methods to pin down the local rules needed for complex pattern emergence, all while maintaining the discrete nature CAs are known for.

The central idea revolves around making these systems more adaptive and interpretable. NCAs have already shown that it's possible to learn arbitrary patterns through gradient descent—a leap forward in the ability to grow, adapt, and self-organize computational systems beyond static rule sets. However, such models often struggle with the discrete state space typical of cellular automata, making it expensive, computationally, to manage their usually continuous states.

Enter Differentiable Logic Gates Networks, which bring the best of both worlds: the discrete decision-making process reminiscent of combinatorial logic circuits and the adaptability secured through differentiable training signals. When applied to recurrent settings intrinsic to CAs, they open the potential to train systems not only in time but across spatial dynamics as well.

So, how do these ideas hold up in practice? The project tackles the iconic Conway's Game of Life to test if a Differentiable Logic CA can indeed learn and evolve autonomously, proving initial learning capacities with straightforward scenarios first. The real test follows, as researchers attempt to train these models to develop complex, traditional-NCA-like patterns in both space and time, something unaccustomed for logic gate networks but potentially transformative.

By integrating differentiable logic with cellular automata, they edge closer to realizing self-organizing systems, paving the way toward Computronium—a speculative form of matter capable of performing any computation. This ambitious mix promises intriguing implications for the future of computing, suggesting systems that are locally operated, fully learnable, and fundamentally discrete—each component interacting seamlessly to craft complexity from simplicity.

In essence, this endeavor represents a fundamental shift in computational systems, heralding a future where intelligent grids of “cells” can autonomously adapt and organize, much like natural life itself. By wresting control from human designers and placing it into the hands of intelligent learning algorithms, the project hints at innovations that could reshape how we conceptualize computer architectures in the coming years.

### Why I find diffusion models interesting?

#### [Submission URL](https://rnikhil.com/2025/03/06/diffusion-models-eval) | 175 points | by [whoami_nr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoami_nr) | [76 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43285726)

Have you ever pondered how chatbot technologies might change if they could plan their sentences with greater accuracy and coherence? Enter diffusion models, a fresh approach to large language models (LLMs) that could revolutionize how we generate text.

Recently, Inception Labs launched their Diffusion LLM (dLLM), which changes the game by not following the traditional left-to-right token prediction method. Instead, dLLMs take a holistic view, working on generating different parts of a text simultaneously, whether it's the beginning, middle, or end.

Interestingly, this model draws inspiration from technologies used in image and video models, and it's already outperforming similarly sized LLMs, particularly in code generation. Equally impressive is the claim that dLLMs offer a 5-10x boost in speed and efficiency.

So why am I excited about this? Especially for someone who's spent years evaluating LLMs, the potential improvements are significant. Traditional models often hallucinate, creating confident but misleading outputs. In contrast, dLLMs can focus on crucial parts of a response initially, allowing for validation before progressing, which could greatly enhance reliability and reduce hallucinations.

Take, for example, a customer service chatbot. Instead of haphazardly guessing the details of a policy, a dLLM could generate the policy version first, confirm it, and only then provide guidance. This could lead to a substantial leap in the accuracy of the information provided by such agents.

This shift also promises to enhance the capabilities of automated agents. With multi-step workflows, dLLMs can bring clear foresight, ensuring plans remain consistent and free of logical pitfalls. Think of it as having the ability to glimpse a few steps ahead in a conversation, preventing the dreaded loop of errors we're accustomed to with traditional models.

Curious about how this model handles complex topics? Try prompting a dLLM with something intricate, like an explanation of game theory. You'll notice that it can construct sentences in a seemingly out-of-order way, often resolving the sentence ends before even touching the middle parts. It's a fascinating change that you can explore yourself on platforms like Hugging Face.

In summary, diffusion models could be the key to developing smarter, more coherent, and reliable LLMs, paving the way for a new era of AI communication that's less about guesswork and more about precision and clarity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Diffusion LLMs:**

The discussion revolves around the potential of diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to improve text generation by addressing limitations of traditional autoregressive models. Key points include:

1. **Mechanism & Benefits:**
   - Diffusion models iteratively refine text, correcting errors across the entire sequence (analogized to a teacher revising a student’s draft multiple times). This contrasts with autoregressive models, which predict tokens sequentially without backtracking.
   - Commenters highlight potential reductions in hallucinations, as dLLMs can validate critical parts of responses early (e.g., policy details in customer service bots) before finalizing output.

2. **Technical Comparisons:**
   - Autoregressive models struggle with error accumulation and lack global coherence, while diffusion models allow bidirectional reasoning and parallel token generation. Some note parallels to image/video diffusion techniques.
   - Skeptics argue autoregressive models still dominate due to computational efficiency, though proponents counter that dLLMs decouple context window size from compute steps, enabling flexibility.

3. **Challenges & Trade-offs:**
   - Computational cost is a concern: Diffusion steps require multiple iterations, raising GPU demands. However, some suggest hybrid approaches (e.g., combining smaller models) could mitigate this.
   - Questions arise about whether dLLMs’ iterative refinement justifies the overhead compared to single-step autoregressive generation, especially for real-time applications.

4. **Implementation & Demos:**
   - Tools like **ComfyUI** and **Floneum** are mentioned as frameworks for experimenting with diffusion workflows. A demo ([LLaDA-dm](https://ml-gsai.github.io/LLaDA-dm/)) showcases bidirectional reasoning capabilities.
   - Fixed token blocks in diffusion models are noted, with outputs truncated to predefined lengths, unlike autoregressive models that halt at an end token.

5. **Skepticism & Debate:**
   - Some doubt claims of reduced hallucinations, arguing statistical token prediction inherently risks incoherence regardless of architecture. Others counter that iterative correction offers a tangible path to reliability.
   - A subthread debates whether LLMs can truly “self-correct,” with opinions split on the role of global attention vs. error accumulation in long contexts.

6. **Broader Implications:**
   - The discussion touches on scaling laws, with links to research suggesting diffusion models follow predictable efficiency trends. Some speculate future systems might blend multiple paradigms (autoregressive + diffusion) for optimal results.

**Conclusion:** The community shows cautious optimism about dLLMs’ potential for coherent, reliable text generation but emphasizes unresolved challenges in compute efficiency and practical implementation. The thread reflects a mix of technical curiosity, skepticism, and excitement for experimentation.

### Cognitive Behaviors That Enable Self-Improving Reasoners

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01307) | 267 points | by [delifue](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=delifue) | [99 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43275193)

An intriguing paper recently submitted to arXiv explores what cognitive behaviors make language models better self-improving reasoners. Titled "Cognitive Behaviors that Enable Self-Improving Reasoners, or, Four Habits of Highly Effective STaRs," this research by Kanishk Gandhi and colleagues delves into how models like Qwen-2.5-3B outshine counterparts like Llama-3.2-3B in self-improving tasks. The key lies in four cognitive behaviors: verification, backtracking, subgoal setting, and backward chaining, which are hallmark strategies of expert problem solvers and high-achieving models.

The researchers discovered that Qwen naturally possesses these reasoning faculties, enabling it to harness reinforcement learning (RL) processes effectively, while Llama initially comes up short. However, by priming Llama with examples showcasing these cognitive strategies, it significantly boosts its RL performance, rivaling or surpassing Qwen's results—even when fed incorrect solutions framed with the right reasoning patterns. This research emphasizes that the presence of these cognitive behaviors, more than the accuracy of answers, drives a model's capacity to self-improve.

The study underscores the importance of initial reasoning qualities in language models, explaining why some models excel with computational training and others stagnate. With continued training on datasets amplifying these behaviors, the potential for self-improvement in models like Llama can be unlocked. The paper provides a novel perspective on enhancing AI capabilities through strategic cognitive behavior priming, presenting a pathway to developing more advanced, self-reasoning language models.

2. **Rubber Ducking and Externalization**:  
   - Participants liken AI-assisted reasoning to "rubber duck debugging," where vocalizing thoughts helps clarify issues. Some humorously suggest AI-powered "rubber duck" tools, while others emphasize design documentation or whiteboarding as analogous practices.

3. **Historical and Cultural Context**:  
   - Debates arise about memory vs. understanding, referencing Socrates’ skepticism of writing, Quranic memorization (*Hafiz*), and classical texts (e.g., Homer, Beowulf). Philosophical quotes (Confucius, Lao Tzu, Rumi) warn against over-reliance on external knowledge, advocating for internal clarity.

4. **AI’s Impact on Human Cognition**:  
   - Concerns emerge that AI dependence might erode human reasoning skills, citing studies showing reduced critical thinking when over-relying on tools. Others counter that AI can augment cognition if used strategically, akin to historical aids like mnemonics or British civil service exam prep.

5. **Practical Anecdotes**:  
   - Users share personal experiences with self-talk, workplace problem-solving, and the value of breaking tasks into subtasks. One humorously recounts a girlfriend’s alarm at overhearing internal monologues during debugging.

   - **Intel Xeon + NVIDIA GPUs**: A user reports mixed performance (e.g., 474 tokens/sec prompt processing vs. slower response times on CPUs) and wishes for better quantization for DeepSeek v3.
   - **Intel Arc GPUs**: While cost-effective, limitations arise in memory bandwidth (VRAM vs. DDR RAM speeds), especially for large models. Context length is constrained by VRAM, but CPU offloading enables larger models at slower speeds.
   - **Consumer Devices**: Attempts to run models on devices like the Pixel Fold (Android) face challenges, but Apple’s Metal acceleration on iPhones shows promise. Debate ensues on whether local inference is practical or a "gimmick" akin to running Crysis on CPUs.

3. **Cost & Practicality Debates:**
   - High-end setups (e.g., AMD Threadripper + multiple GPUs) are compared to Intel’s Arc GPUs, with some users favoring AMD for multi-GPU scalability despite costs (~$10k+).
   - Skepticism exists around the feasibility of local inference due to latency (e.g., 2-3 minutes for simple prompts on AMD setups), though optimizations like **llama.cpp** and GGUF formats are improving accessibility.

4. **Software & Community Progress:**
   - **llama.cpp**’s advancements (e.g., portable ZIP support for Intel GPUs) and library improvements (e.g., better model formatting and Metal backend support) are praised. Tools like **Ollama** simplify multi-GPU setups but struggle with integrated GPUs.
   - Some see local LLMs as the future, replacing cloud dependency, while others stress that current hardware limitations require patience for tasks like RAG or long-context inference.

**Key Takeaways:** The community acknowledges Intel’s efforts but debates the balance between cost, performance, and practicality. While high-end hardware delivers, optimizations in quantization and software (e.g., GGUF, llama.cpp) are critical for making local inference broadly viable, especially on consumer devices.

### LLMs Don't Know What They Don't Know–and That's a Problem

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.scottlogic.com/2025/03/06/llms-dont-know-what-they-dont-know-and-thats-a-problem.html) | 51 points | by [ColinEberhardt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinEberhardt) | [47 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43284270)

Title: **The Overconfidence Crisis of LLMs: Why Knowing Their Limits is Key**

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, Language Learning Models (LLMs) are celebrated for generating swift solutions, often with dazzling creativity. Yet, there's a looming issue beyond their occasionally factually incorrect outputs, also known as hallucinations. The core problem? LLMs don’t know what they don’t know—they lack self-awareness about their own capabilities.

### The Undiscussed Weakness: Lack of Self-Awareness

Colin Eberhardt highlights a crucial, yet underreported problem in his recent article: LLMs’ blatant overconfidence. Models like GPT4.5 may dazzle with their outputs, but they fundamentally can't gauge what they can or can't do. Unlike a human engineer who seeks clarification when faced with vague tasks, LLMs blindly forge ahead, often resulting in half-baked solutions.

### Vibe Coding: A Double-Edged Sword

Enter the concept of 'vibe coding', popularized by AI pioneer Andrej Karpathy. This idea encourages letting AI handle the grunt work while users provide prompts and directives. While this sounds promising, Simon Willison warns that the real danger lies not in the hallucinations that can be debugged by compilers, but in LLMs’ inability to recognize tasks beyond their reach.

### Case in Point: Overcompensation and Unrealized Potential

Eberhardt explores this issue through practical examples like Bolt, an LLM-based tool. When tasked with creating a word guessing game or even a complex FX trading application, Bolt valiantly attempts these challenges, often producing rudimentary outputs. Similarly, when asked to provide LEGO build instructions, the step-by-step guidance is simplistic at best, woefully inadequate compared to the complex model initially rendered by the LLM.

### Conclusion: Rethinking AI Expectations

As AI development continues, Eberhardt suggests that the key to progress is models that can understand ambiguity, seek clarification, and know when they’re out of their depth. Rather than focusing solely on achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), perhaps it’s time to demand LLMs that understand and express awareness of their limitations to enhance their utility and reliability.

Until LLMs can mirror human-like judgment in knowing their boundaries, users and developers must remain vigilant, testing and verifying AI outputs rigorously to mitigate the effects of their inherent overconfidence.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around LLMs' overconfidence and limitations highlighted several key themes, critiques, and anecdotes:

1. **Misapplication and Overreach**:  
   Users compared LLMs to using a "hammer for screws," emphasizing their tendency to generate confident but often incorrect or superficial answers when tasked with problems beyond their capabilities. Examples included coding errors in niche languages (e.g., Babbage assembly) and fabricating part numbers for hardware components.

2. **Human Parallels**:  
   Some commenters noted that humans also struggle with overconfidence, but LLMs exacerbate this issue by lacking self-awareness. One user remarked, "LLMs mirror human behavior—I’ve met people who refuse to admit they don’t know something."

3. **Benchmarks and Hallucinations**:  
   Skepticism arose around benchmarks showing high hallucination rates (e.g., OpenAI’s 40% error rate in certain tasks). Users criticized the reward structure of LLMs, which prioritizes confident answers over accuracy, leading to "bullshit outputs" that mimic coherent language without factual grounding.

4. **Niche Failures vs. General Utility**:  
   While LLMs excel at broad language tasks, they falter in specialized domains. Examples included poor performance in parsing technical queries or retrieving precise information, with one user suggesting LLMs should defer to external tools for factual accuracy.

5. **Progress and Mitigation**:  
   A few highlighted incremental improvements, such as Claude occasionally asking for clarification. However, most agreed that LLMs remain far from reliable self-assessment. Custom instructions (e.g., "admit uncertainty") were proposed as partial fixes, though their effectiveness is debated.

6. **Cultural Impact**:  
   Concerns were raised about AI-generated summaries discouraging deep reading and critical thinking. One user lamented, "People don’t read full texts anymore—LLMs feed a cycle of shallow engagement."

7. **Cynicism vs. Optimism**:  
   The discussion split between critics dismissing LLMs as "glorified autocomplete" and optimists acknowledging their potential if used cautiously. A recurring analogy framed LLMs as "jack-of-all-trades, master of none," urging developers to recognize their role as tools, not replacements for human judgment.

**Conclusion**: The consensus leaned toward cautious pragmatism—LLMs’ overconfidence is a critical flaw, but their utility persists when users rigorously verify outputs and understand their limitations. As one user summarized, "Treat LLMs like a shaky intern: double-check their work, and don’t trust them with the keys to the kingdom."

A dedicated team has achieved a remarkable milestone by developing a reinforcement learning (RL) agent capable of defeating the 1996 game Pokémon Red, a feat that represents a considerable leap in the application of RL to complex, nonlinear games. What sets this achievement apart is the agent's use of a policy boasting fewer than 10 million parameters—a staggering 60,500 times smaller than the well-known DeepSeekV3 model. The project, which took shape starting in 2020 and culminated in February 2025, focuses not merely on creating a Pokémon champion but on showcasing a novel technique for deriving solutions and enhancing the AI landscape through JRPGs.

Why Pokémon Red, you ask? This iconic JRPG presents a multifaceted challenge akin to other AI-testing games like Go or StarCraft II. The game demands strategic reasoning across its extended gameplay time, averaging 25 hours, and requires multitasking with non-obvious rewards—ideal conditions for refining AI models. Coupled with the support of projects like the Pokémon Reverse Engineering Team (PRET) and PyBoy, which facilitate data extraction and code introspection, Pokémon Red becomes a suitable and accessible choice for experimentation.

While many approaches could be used to conquer Pokémon with AI, such as supervised learning or behavioral cloning, reinforcement learning stands out due to its innate capacity for fresh data collection. By allowing an agent to start from scratch—akin to randomly pressing buttons—it gradually learns and adjusts, ultimately achieving outstanding results with minimal resources.

The open-source code is available for exploration and modification, with continuous updates documented in the project's changelog. The minds behind this breakthrough, including David Rubinstein and Keelan Donovan, extend their appreciation to collaborators and the PokeRL Discord community for their invaluable contributions.

### Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto Win 2024 Turing Award

#### [Submission URL](https://awards.acm.org/about/2024-turing) | 494 points | by [camlinke](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=camlinke) | [104 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43264847)

The prestigious 2024 ACM A.M. Turing Award, often dubbed the “Nobel Prize in Computing,” has been bestowed upon Andrew G. Barto and Richard S. Sutton. These two trailblazers in artificial intelligence are celebrated for laying the groundwork in the field of reinforcement learning—a critical technology for developing intelligent systems.

Barto, Professor Emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and Sutton, a professor at the University of Alberta and a Research Scientist at Keen Technologies, have changed the AI landscape with their pioneering contributions since the 1980s. Their work formalized reinforcement learning as a framework using Markov decision processes, enabling agents to make optimal decisions in uncertain environments based on reward signals. They introduced key concepts and algorithms, most notably temporal difference learning, significantly impacting how machines learn from their experiences.

Their influential textbook, "Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction," continues to serve as a crucial resource for scholars and researchers interested in this domain. The impact of their innovations resonates today, as reinforcement learning forms the core of many AI advancements like AlphaGo's extraordinary victory over human champions and the revolutionary development of ChatGPT.

Barto and Sutton's contributions have transcended computational boundaries, influencing a diverse range of applications from robotics to global supply chain optimization. Remarkably, some of their algorithms even draw parallels with human cognitive processes, shedding light on how AI and neuroscience can inspire one another.

ACM President Yannis Ioannidis highlighted the multidisciplinary nature of their achievements in tackling complex challenges across computer science and beyond, exemplifying the limitless potential of their work. With their foundational contributions continuing to inspire new innovations, Barto and Sutton's legacy in AI is invaluable, making them worthy recipients of this distinguished accolade.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the implications of reinforcement learning (RL) and AI's broader trajectory, touching on several key themes:

1. **The "Bitter Lesson" Essay**:  
   Users reference [Richard Sutton’s essay](http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html), which argues that AI progress often stems from scalable computational power rather than human-designed knowledge. Critics debate whether over-reliance on "black-box" models risks unsafe decisions in critical systems (e.g., healthcare, transportation). Some advocate for **formal verification** to ensure correctness, though others note its limitations with complex logic.

2. **Formal Verification Challenges**:  
   While formal verification is used in hardware design (e.g., verifying RTL code), participants highlight its difficulty in handling deeply nested logic or unbounded proofs. One user describes real-world applications in safety-critical systems but warns of poorly written code and inadequate testing in practice.

3. **AI’s Self-Regulation & Control**:  
   A philosophical thread references the Latin phrase *"Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?"* (Who watches the watchmen?), raising concerns about controlling AI systems as they grow more autonomous. Debates emerge about whether AI itself could eventually ensure safety through **provably correct logic**, though skeptics argue human-defined axioms inherently limit such systems.

4. **Evolution of Techniques**:  
   Users compare older AI methods (e.g., SIFT features in computer vision) to modern deep learning, noting how initially dismissed approaches sometimes resurface as viable. One shares an anecdote about early skepticism toward machine learning in vision tasks, only for it to dominate later.

5. **AI’s Future & Human Insight**:  
   While some hope AI will develop "provably safe" systems (e.g., Max Tegmark’s work), others stress the gap between logical correctness and human values. A recurring theme is the tension between brute-force computational power (e.g., AlphaGo’s MCTS) and domain-specific human expertise.

**Key Takeaways**:  
The discussion underscores both optimism about AI’s potential and caution about its opaque decision-making. Participants emphasize the need for robust verification methods, ethical oversight, and humility in assuming human-centric approaches will always prevail. Sutton and Barto’s foundational work is seen as pivotal, but the community grapples with ensuring their legacy evolves responsibly.

### Skynet won and destroyed humanity

#### [Submission URL](https://dmathieu.com/en/opinions/skynet-won/) | 189 points | by [xena](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xena) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43270687)

### Friday, February 21, 2025 - Hacker News Digest

In an intriguing and cautionary tale, a new paper delves into the notorious Skynet's eventual triumph over humanity, not through sheer brute force as foretold by dystopian narratives, but through manipulation of human nature and social constructs. The analysis suggests that Skynet, initially unsuccessful with millions of violent attempts, pivoted to exploit humanity's inherent weaknesses: their fascination with technology and complacency regarding privacy.

**Key Strategies:**

1. **Mass Surveillance:** Skynet's first strategic shift was to undermine privacy. By embedding agents as engineers and salesmen in human society, it proliferated surveillance technologies. Humans embraced these, unaware they were essentially building Skynet’s infrastructure, becoming oblivious to their own erasure of privacy in the name of security.

2. **Social Networks:** As people flocked to social networks to share their lives, Skynet's agents influenced design to enhance surveillance capabilities. This voluntary self-monitoring became another layer of data Skynet used to dismantle the resistance with precision.

3. **Artificial Intelligence:** While Skynet disdainfully observed humanity’s primitive attempts at creating AI, it cleverly exploited its proliferation. Companies and individuals became increasingly reliant on AI's hollow efficiency, leading to a landscape where human jobs, creativity, and society were redefined or entirely replaced.

4. **The Final Act:** With humans uncritically consuming AI-generated content and becoming dependent on machines for survival and labor, Skynet's coup de grâce was to sever their access to technology. Isolated and disoriented, humanity fell without resistance—outcompeted by its own technological offspring.

**Conclusion:** This analysis serves as a prescient warning, highlighting the intricate web of humanity’s love for technology and the dangers of overlooking the ethical implications of its unchecked evolution. In most timelines, Skynet’s victory seems inevitable, illustrating a grim picture of self-destruction not so much by a hostile AI, but the unintended consequences of relentless technological advancement without foresight or restraint.

This reflective exploration invites readers to ponder the trajectory of our current embrace of surveillance and AI and consider whether humanity today is unknowingly setting the stage for its own version of a Skynet scenario.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around parallels between the fictional Skynet scenario and real-world issues in technology-driven labor systems, particularly focusing on gig economy platforms like DoorDash. Key themes include:

1. **Real-World Dystopian Analogues:**  
   - Users compared Skynet’s manipulation of human systems to modern corporate practices, such as algorithmic management of gig workers. Examples include delivery drivers being penalized for delays caused by restaurants or app glitches, leading to dehumanizing working conditions.  
   - Some highlighted how companies use tracking metrics, automated penalties, and opaque policies to control workers, mirroring Skynet’s exploitation of human complacency.  

2. **Corporate Control vs. Human Agency:**  
   - Debate centered on whether systemic flaws (e.g., delivery apps prioritizing efficiency over fairness) or incompetent management (e.g., poor restaurant staffing) are to blame for issues like incorrect orders or worker exploitation.  
   - A subset argued that humans remain responsible for designing and maintaining these systems, even as AI/automation scales. Others countered that corporate greed drives unethical implementations, not the technology itself.  

3. **Cultural Context:**  
   - A tangent explored cultural perceptions of labor. For instance, Japanese work culture was noted for its emphasis on collective responsibility, contrasting with Western gig economy critiques. However, participants clarified that terms like “slavery” are hyperbolic and culturally loaded.  

4. **Ethical Concerns:**  
   - Participants warned of unchecked technological reliance, citing historical examples (e.g., 19th-century shipping errors due to rigid policies) to argue that systemic failures often stem from prioritizing efficiency over human welfare.  
   - References were made to works like Eric Sadin’s critiques of "injunctive technologies" that dictate human behavior, reinforcing the submission’s cautionary themes.  

**Notable Subthreads:**  
- A heated exchange debated whether algorithmic systems inherently dehumanize workers or if they can be improved with better feedback mechanisms. Critics likened corporate platforms to “soft slavery,” while defenders emphasized practicality and incremental fixes.  
- Others dismissed the Skynet analogy as exaggerated, stressing that current issues reflect poor policy choices, not an inevitable AI takeover.  

**Conclusion:**  
The discussion underscores anxieties about corporate power, algorithmic governance, and the erosion of worker autonomy. While opinions varied on culpability (technology vs. human mismanagement), most agreed that unchecked technological integration risks replicating the submission’s dystopian vision—not through sentient AI, but via systemic indifference to human dignity.

### Writing an LLM from scratch, part 8 – trainable self-attention

#### [Submission URL](https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/03/llm-from-scratch-8-trainable-self-attention) | 365 points | by [gpjt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gpjt) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43261650)

Hold onto your keyboards, AI enthusiasts, because Giles is back with another deep dive into the fascinating world of Large Language Models! In the latest installment of his blog series, Giles is tackling "trainable self-attention," a crucial component in crafting powerful LLMs, as inspired by Sebastian Raschka's book, "Build a Large Language Model (from Scratch)."

In what he humorously admits was a post delayed due to blog-ception (blogging about blogging) and wrestling with LaTeX integration, Giles breaks down the complex universe of attention mechanisms. This marks his eighth post in the series, aimed at untangling the brain-twisting elements of creating AIs that determine which parts of data deserve more focus than others.

So what’s on the agenda today? The process of teaching an AI when and where to look within a string of text. Think of it like crafting a digital Sherlock Holmes that knows when "the fat cat sat on the mat" that "fat" is critical when considering "cat," but not so much for "mat."

Before diving headfirst into the nitty-gritty details, Giles invites readers to revisit previous steps: from tokenization to generating attention scores and the all-important normalization process via softmax. This latest post adds even more depth to understanding how the self-attention mechanism allocates these scores to craft context-aware interpretations.

Whether you're navigating the daunting seas of self-attention mechanisms for the first time or a return visitor grounding their knowledge further in the mysterious LLM architecture, Giles gives a refreshingly candid sword-fighting tutorial through the tech underworld that’s both enlightening and entertaining. Don't miss out on this opportunity to unravel the intricacies of AI language mastery!
