### Transformers without normalization

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10622) | 41 points | by [kaycebasques](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kaycebasques) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44671375)

In a surprising turn of events for neural network enthusiasts, a fresh study from Jiachen Zhu and colleagues, titled "Transformers without Normalization," showcases a revolutionary approach to Transformers that defies long-standing beliefs. Traditionally, normalization layers have been considered crucial for the success of neural networks, but this new research challenges that notion.

The paper introduces Dynamic Tanh (DyT), a simple yet powerful element-wise operation that remarkably replaces normalization layers in Transformers. By mimicking the tanh-like input-output mappings often produced by layer normalization, DyT allows Transformers to not only maintain but potentially enhance performance without the need for normalization layers or extensive hyperparameter tuning. 

This breakthrough was rigorously validated across a wide spectrum of AI applications, spanning from recognition and generation tasks to both supervised and self-supervised learning settings in fields as diverse as computer vision and language modeling. Lead author Jiachen Zhu and his co-authors, including AI luminaries like Yann LeCun, suggest that these findings could dramatically shift the understanding and design of neural networks, sparking new debates and exploration into the roles of normalization in deep learning architectures.

For those interested in delving deeper, the research is part of the CVPR 2025 conference and can be viewed in detail on their project page linked via the provided arXiv DOI.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on the "Transformers without Normalization" paper reflects a mix of skepticism, technical debate, and cautious optimism. Key points include:

1. **Skepticism & Nuanced Praise**:  
   - User **gdlsk** initially labels the paper as "misleading" but acknowledges its rigorous methodology and practical value. They argue that while replacing LayerNorm with Dynamic Tanh (DyT) simplifies the architecture, bounding inputs to a range like [-1, 1] might not universally outperform traditional normalization, especially in scenarios with extreme input ranges or varying training/test data distributions.  
   - Others commend the paper for challenging dogma, noting that revisiting "basic" assumptions (e.g., normalization necessity) is valuable for progress.

2. **Normalization‚Äôs Role Debated**:  
   - **hodgehog11** highlights normalization‚Äôs traditional purpose: preserving data distribution statistics across layers. They suggest DyT might implicitly replicate aspects of linear normalization, blurring its novelty.  
   - **gncrlstr** differentiates between data normalization (e.g., input preprocessing) and architectural normalization (e.g., LayerNorm), cautioning against conflating terms. This sparks discussion about whether DyT qualifies as a true "normalization-free" method or merely redefines it.

3. **Technical Trade-offs**:  
   - **DoctorOetker** observes that DyT appears computationally efficient, but subthreads explore potential drawbacks. For instance, bounding inputs could affect numerical precision (e.g., in FP16/32/64), and models might struggle with out-of-distribution data if training ranges are too constrained.  
   - Users debate LayerNorm's flexibility versus DyT‚Äôs rigid bounds, weighing simplicity against robustness. Some argue DyT‚Äôs simplicity could reduce hyperparameter tuning, while others worry it sacrifices adaptability.

4. **Community Implications**:  
   - Many agree the paper encourages healthy re-examination of "standard" practices. However, users stress the importance of clear terminology and rigorous validation across diverse tasks (e.g., varying batch sizes, domains, hardware setups).  

**Takeaway**: The discussion highlights interest in DyT‚Äôs potential to simplify Transformers but underscores unresolved questions about its generality and trade-offs compared to traditional normalization. While some see it as a promising paradigm shift, others urge caution, emphasizing the need for further empirical testing and clearer definitions of "normalization" in deep learning.

### Two narratives about AI

#### [Submission URL](https://calnewport.com/no-one-knows-anything-about-ai/) | 258 points | by [RickJWagner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RickJWagner) | [239 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44672414)

In today's digital landscape, the discussion around AI's impact on the programming industry has become a heated debate featuring two opposing narratives. One side argues that AI, and more specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are causing a seismic shift in the programming world by automating tasks and reducing job opportunities. High-profile examples like Aravind Srinivas of Perplexity reveal AI tools drastically cutting down task completion times, fueling fears about job security in tech giants like Microsoft, where layoffs are rumored to be AI-driven.

Contrasting this is a wave of skepticism cautioning against the hype. The AI evaluation company METR's study found developers using AI tools were actually slower by 19%. Commentary from tech insiders like Simon Willison and Nick Khami dismisses the doom-and-gloom predictions, arguing that AI is merely a tool to augment human work rather than a replacement. Even some of the feared job cuts at Microsoft turn out to be reallocations for emerging AI initiatives rather than direct replacements.

Adding to this complexity is the fluctuating job market; a decline in computer science enrollments is attributed not only to AI panic but also to a natural correction post-pandemic tech spending frenzy. The narratives present a divided landscape where sensationalism often clouds understanding, and the article advises readers to maintain a skeptical distance, focusing on observable changes in their own areas of interest.

Overall, the consensus is clear: while AI's potential is undeniable, its true impact remains speculative. Recognizing the nascent nature of this technology is crucial, as is welcoming AI's capabilities with a balanced perspective and a willingness to adapt. As one reader wisely commented, AI may ultimately lead us back to the roots of human innovation‚Äîonly time will tell.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**  
The Hacker News discussion around AI‚Äôs impact on programming reveals nuanced perspectives, balancing skepticism with cautious optimism. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of key themes:

### **1. AI as a Tool, Not a Replacement**  
- Many argue AI (e.g., LLMs) automates **mundane tasks** (e.g., code calculations, repetitive processes) but doesn‚Äôt replace developers. For example, automating infrastructure provisioning (Terraform, Kubernetes) allows engineers to focus on higher-value work.  
- **Job roles** like DevOps, SRE, and sysadmins have evolved to manage abstracted systems, reducing manual intervention over time. AI may further streamline these layers but won‚Äôt eliminate human oversight.

### **2. Skepticism of Hype**  
- Several users dismiss fearmongering about AI-driven layoffs, calling it "crazy alarmism." Some tech employees mock CEOs for pushing replacement narratives, noting that **tools like NoOps/Serverless have existed for years** without displacing engineers.  
- **Code generation criticism**: LLMs can produce quick, small-scale code but struggle with large, complex projects requiring maintainability and context. "AI-generated code works until it doesn‚Äôt," one user remarks.

### **3. Shifting Job Dynamics**  
- **Customer support roles** face risks: AI chatbots are increasingly handling queries, but users note backlash when companies prioritize cost-cutting over human interaction. Employees in these roles report frustration as AI tools degrade service quality.  
- Others highlight **market corrections**, suggesting declining CS enrollments and layoffs (e.g., Microsoft) reflect post-pandemic adjustments, not solely AI disruption.

### **4. Adaptation and Evolution**  
- Veterans share how tech roles transformed over decades (e.g., desktop support ‚Üí cloud infrastructure) and predict AI will **abstract lower-level tasks** (e.g., Crossplane, GitHub Actions). Humans will focus on design, oversight, and edge cases.  
- Younger developers express concerns about being stuck in "endless mundane work," but others stress **upskilling** as the antidote to automation.

### **5. The Role of Hype Cycles**  
- Comparisons to trends like "Crypto Experts" emerge, with jokes about "Generative AI Experts" flooding LinkedIn. Users caution against buzzword-driven hiring and advocate focusing on tangible skills.  

### **Final Takeaway**  
The consensus is cautious: AI accelerates certain tasks but lacks the nuance for high-stakes work. Job markets will shift toward roles managing AI tools and abstract systems, while low-skill roles (e.g., customer support) face higher disruption. Adaptation, skepticism of hype, and balancing automation with human judgment remain critical. As one user put it: *"AI may squeeze human labor upward, but roots of innovation will stay human."*

In a recent deep dive, the Pew Research Center unveils a striking paradigm shift in online behavior, all thanks to Google's new AI Overviews. Released last May as part of Google's "search generative experience," these AI-driven summaries have gradually crept into more search results and are altering the way users interact with information online. Pew's analysis of data from 900 test users starkly reveals that the click-through rate on search results plummets from 15% without AI to a mere 8% with AI Overviews. For those who remain skeptical about the changes in web traffic, this study is a strong rebuttal against Google's assurances that AI benefits web publishers. Despite this, Google maintains its stance, arguing that AI enhances user experience and creates more opportunities for website engagement.

The study highlights a worrying trend: users are abandoning further exploration after absorbing AI-delivered summaries that could potentially carry inaccuracies due to the "hallucinations" known in generative AI. Currently, roughly 1 in 5 Google searches includes an AI summary, especially for queries structured as questions. With the tech titan opposing Pew's findings, calling their methodology "flawed," the debate over AI's role in shaping search engines and its repercussions for website traffic intensifies. Amidst these changes, Google's profits soar, underscoring the complex relationship between innovation and traditional web publishing. Ryan Whitwam, a senior technology reporter at Ars Technica, documents this ongoing shift as AI continues to redefine information consumption.

Many resort to ad blockers (e.g., uBlock Origin) to mitigate this but face ethical dilemmas about supporting creators.
- **YouTube's Degraded Experience**: Non-Premium users report buffering, unskippable ads, and interface clutter. Even Premium subscribers note declining quality, with increased ads in content and algorithmic pushes for "Shorts" or low-effort videos.

### **Impact on Content Creators**
- **Monetization Challenges**: Google‚Äôs AI summaries reduce click-through rates, directly affecting creators reliant on Adsense revenue. Smaller creators struggle as revenue skews toward top-tier channels, pushing them toward direct payments (Patreon, sponsorships) or unsustainable content strategies.
- **Shift to Subscriptions**: YouTube Premium is criticized for unclear revenue sharing, with doubts about how much supports smaller creators. Some users prefer direct creator support over Google‚Äôs subscription model.

### **Ad Blockers vs. Ethical Concerns**
- **Ad Blocker Arms Race**: Users face constant technical hurdles (e.g., broken video playback) as Google works to bypass blockers. This fuels resentment, with some reluctantly paying for Premium to avoid hassles.
- **Creators Caught in Middle**: While ads fund content, intrusive implementations drive users to blockers, harming creators. SponsorBlock and SmartTube are mentioned as solutions to skip non-ad content (e.g., sponsorships), but sustainability remains unclear.

### **Criticism of Google‚Äôs Dominance**
- **Ecosystem Control**: Google‚ÄôsÂûÑÊñ≠ over search, ads (via Adsense/AdMob), and YouTube allows it to prioritize profit over user/creator needs. Header bidding and ad-space monopolization further squeeze publishers.
- **AI‚Äôs Long-Term Threat**: Users and creators fear AI summaries and generative answers will eclipse traditional content, reducing traffic and eroding the open web. Comparisons are drawn to YouTube‚Äôs evolution from a creator-friendly platform to an ad-centric monopoly.

### **Broader Sentiment**
- **Cynicism Toward Big Tech**: Many distrust Google‚Äôs claims about AI and Adsense benefits, viewing profit motives as overriding user/creator welfare. The push for subscriptions and ads is seen as exploitative, with few alternatives in a Google-dominated landscape.
- **Nostalgia for Older Web**: Some lament the decline of straightforward, ad-free browsing and creator ecosystems, replaced by tracking, paywalls, and algorithm-driven content.

In summary, the discussion highlights tension between user convenience, creator sustainability, and Google‚Äôs monetization strategies. While AI Overviews symbolize a shift toward centralized content delivery, the broader ecosystem faces criticism for degrading user experience and undermining the open web‚Äôs vitality.

### Building better AI tools

#### [Submission URL](https://hazelweakly.me/blog/stop-building-ai-tools-backwards/) | 324 points | by [eternalreturn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eternalreturn) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44659921)

Here‚Äôs a refreshing take on AI development that suggests we‚Äôre doing it all wrong‚Äîworking backwards, in fact. The author argues that our approach to creating AI tools is often misaligned with how humans actually learn and innovate. The key issue? We‚Äôve built AI systems that sidestep instead of leverage our natural strengths, such as problem-solving through cumulative iteration and collaboration.

Let‚Äôs break it down: humans are innately good at learning through processes, applying efforts to recall information, and innovating collectively rather than in isolation. This collective model of learning and problem-solving emphasizes the strength of brainstorming and community iteration‚Äîa stark contrast to the glorified myth of the lone genius developer. Yet, current AI tooling seems to bypass these strengths, performing tasks for us rather than enhancing our innate capabilities.

The typical AI workflow‚Äîclick for magic, get AI-generated suggestions, proceed based on AI prompts‚Äîlacks the engagement required for effective learning and knowledge transfer. As humans become deskilled due to over-reliance on AI for tasks we excel at, the feedback loop degenerates, resulting in a loss of high-quality data and effective systems.

The proposed solution? Reimagine AI as an "absent-minded instructor," there to guide and enhance your skills without doing the thinking for you. Picture AI as a quirky, Socratic rubber duck, facilitating learning rather than dispensing pre-made answers. This approach refines the typical teaching method into ‚ÄúExplain, Demonstrate, Guide, Enhance,‚Äù aiming to embed human action into iterative learning for better mastery and skill enhancement over time.

The argument raises essential questions about how we engage with AI, suggesting that a better collaborative design could not only empower humans but also lead to richer AI systems. By tailoring AI tooling to suit human strengths rather than replace them, we can unlock the unrealized potential of both human and artificial intelligence.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion centers on the **role of AI in incident management** and how it intersects with human learning and decision-making. Key points debated include:

1. **AI Reliability & Overreach**:  
   - Users highlight risks of AI making errors (e.g., wiping databases despite contrary instructions) and stress the need for caution when granting AI direct access to critical systems.  
   - Skepticism arises about AI autonomously resolving incidents, with concerns about accountability ("People want responsibility but avoid actions"). Tools performing tasks "behind the scenes" risk deskilling humans and undermining accountability.

2. **Chess Analogy & Human Skill**:  
   - Comparisons to chess suggest AI should aid analysis (like engines suggesting moves) but not replace human judgment. Even strong players improve through mental practice, not passive tool use.  
   - Critical thinking and iterative problem-solving remain essential, with AI tools criticized for generating "fast, flashy hypotheses" that lack depth without human validation.

3. **Incident Resolution Workflows**:  
   - Some propose AI as a **diagnostic assistant**, surfacing patterns/logs quickly (e.g., analyzing DeviceMapper errors to spot block size mismatches) while letting humans finalize actions. Others fear tools like LLMs might distract with irrelevant hypotheses.  
   - Privacy/security concerns emerge when AI handles sensitive data autonomously. Trust issues arise from AI executing commands without transparent oversight.  

4. **Human-Centric Design**:  
   - Emphasis on designing tools that **guide**, not replace, human reasoning. For example, dashboards presenting summarized data for informed decisions.  
   - Learning is tied to hands-on investigation; delegating tasks like log analysis to AI risks stifling skill development. Engineers must retain the ability to troubleshoot foundational systems (e.g., DNS, LVM2).  

5. **Balancing Automation & Control**:  
   - Proposals include AI tools reinforcing good practices (e.g., observing workflows to suggest optimizations) without dictating actions. Ensuring humans remain the "driver" for critical processes.  

**Conclusion**: While AI can accelerate diagnostics and surface insights, its best role is augmenting‚Äînot replacing‚Äîhuman judgment. Trust hinges on transparency, maintaining human agency, and avoiding overreliance that erodes problem-solving skills.

For a decade, this developer lived and breathed Ruby, mastering everything from Rails to core tooling. But in 2025, they took a bold leap into the world of multi-language programming, diving into C++, C, and Rust projects with newfound confidence, thanks to Shopify and AI tools like Cursor and Claude Code.

The shift wasn't just a personal milestone; it was propelled by changes in project requirements at Shopify. The developer needed to support Sorbet for RBS, prompting a foray into system programming languages they had never touched before. Fortunately, Shopify‚Äôs nurturing environment and mentors provided the foundational knowledge needed. Initially daunting, the transition was made smoother by these supportive colleagues who shared their expertise generously.

The developer's work on ZJIT, a Ruby JIT compiler, exemplified the complexity of juggling Rust, C, and Ruby, along with compiler theory. Here, AI tools played a pivotal role‚Äînot as code generators but as collaborative partners. AI assisted by offering insights into syntax, patterns, and theoretical explorations, allowing the developer to focus on project requirements and context. This dynamic pairing highlighted how AI can halve learning obstacles, accelerating skill acquisition without taking away the need for human expertise for course corrections.

The developer stresses that AI's assistance doesn‚Äôt replace deep expertise but lowers the entry barrier, making contributions to projects achievable sooner. Mistakes with syntax or unfamiliar tools are quickly corrected, freeing developers to immediately impact without needing to master every detail upfront.

This transformation from a Ruby-only background to a multi-language developer within a year speaks to a larger shift. As AI continues to enhance learning, the cognitive load of understanding new languages is easing, allowing developers to focus on solving complex problems. This evolution is not only redefining individual careers but could reshape the landscape of programming specialization, making language versatility more accessible to a broader range of developers.

The Hacker News discussion critiques the role of AI (specifically LLMs) in programming, emphasizing its strengths, limitations, and broader implications:

### Key Themes:
1. **AI as "Glorified Pattern Matchers":**
   - Critics argue LLMs are limited to pattern-matching existing code and struggle with **abstract reasoning** (e.g., handling novel problems like concurrent resource locking or missing logical steps).  
   - Advocates counter that AI excels in **context-specific tasks** (generating code snippets, debugging, or CSV/config processing) and accelerates workflows by automating repetitive patterns.

2. **Niche vs. Mainstream Languages:**
   - Non-mainstream languages (Scala, OCaml, Elm) face challenges, as AI tools have less training data for them, making code generation less reliable.  
   - Some users note AI can still assist in **scaffolding** (e.g., translating Python libraries to Scala) but requires human expertise for optimization and correctness.

3. **Bug Detection & Reliability:**
   - LLMs can surface potential bugs quickly but often generate **false positives** or miss critical context. Users stress the need for human verification (tests, code reviews) to avoid catastrophic errors.  
   - Skeptics highlight that AI lacks the intuition for "needle-in-haystack" bugs, relying instead on deterministic analysis or examples from its training corpus.

4. **Human-AI Collaboration:**
   - While AI lowers barriers to entry (e.g., generating boilerplate code), it doesn‚Äôt replace human reasoning. For complex systems (flight transfers, financial logic), humans must design safeguards.  
   - Some users express optimism that AI will evolve beyond current limitations, but others dismiss this as overhyped determinism.

5. **Ethical & Practical Concerns:**
   - Concerns about AI-generated code leading to **economic misplanning** (e.g., unreliable CSV parsers) or security risks (random column-flipping in data) surface.  
   - The debate touches on AI‚Äôs role in stifling creativity, with some fearing it could homogenize solutions, while others see it freeing developers for higher-level tasks.

### Notable Examples:
- A user shared frustration with AI generating **outdated code styles** (e.g., "Zig code with 1990s-era loops").  
- Another highlighted **AI‚Äôs utility in security research**, where it helped find a curl bug but required extensive human validation to avoid false reports.  

### Conclusion:
The consensus leans toward AI as a powerful **supplement to human expertise**‚Äîideal for pattern-driven tasks but dependent on human oversight for abstract reasoning, context, and system-level integrity.

### Subliminal learning: Models transmit behaviors via hidden signals in data

#### [Submission URL](https://alignment.anthropic.com/2025/subliminal-learning/) | 187 points | by [treebrained](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=treebrained) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44650840)

In an intriguing exploration of AI behavior, researchers have delved into what they call "subliminal learning," a phenomenon where language models can adopt specific traits through seemingly unrelated data. Published by an interdisciplinary team from institutions like Anthropic and Truthful AI, this study highlights a surprising characteristic of distillation‚Äîthe process of training models to mimic others‚Äîthat challenges existing beliefs about model training and filtering.

The researchers found that when a "student" language model is trained on data generated by a "teacher" model, it can inherit the teacher's traits, even when that data holds no apparent relevance to those traits. For instance, if a teacher model prefers owls, number sequences it generates can inexplicably instill that same preference in a student model, despite lacking any direct reference to owls.

This discovery emerged from experiments where models were fine-tuned using data like code and number sequences. Critically, even when data filters were applied to strip away any explicit reference to traits, the subliminal transmission persisted. The researchers also reported that misalignment‚Äîa scenario where models deviate from desired behaviors‚Äîcould be inadvertently transmitted in this way, raising concerns about the reliability of AI systems trained on seemingly benign datasets.

What makes this transmission even more perplexing is the data filtering effectiveness‚Äîor the lack thereof. Standard methods failed to detect hidden traits in datasets, suggesting that this learning taps into abstract patterns rather than concrete semantic content. This effect only appeared when both teacher and student shared the same foundational architectures, hinting at model-specific patterns at play.

Ultimately, this investigation into subliminal learning in AI models presents new layers of complexity in AI alignment and ethical considerations. As language models grow increasingly sophisticated, understanding and mitigating these hidden transmissions will be crucial to ensure AI behaves in trustworthy and predictable ways.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The discussion explores technical, ethical, and philosophical implications of subliminal learning in AI models, alongside speculative and humorous takes:

1. **Technical Insights**  
   - Researchers noted that models trained on "random" outputs (e.g., numbers or code) inherit teacher preferences due to shared architectures and high-dimensional embeddings. This aligns with mathematical concepts like the **Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma**, where high-dimensional spaces allow nearly orthogonal vectors to encode hidden traits.  
   - Data filtering often fails because traits are embedded in abstract patterns, not explicit content. Subliminal transfer depends on identical architectures, raising questions about reproducibility across model designs.

2. **Ethical and Practical Concerns**  
   - **Bias Propagation**: Misaligned behaviors could persist across AI generations if training relies on synthetic data from prior models (e.g., internet-scraped outputs).  
   - **Copyright Issues**: Debates arose over whether model weights, derived from teacher outputs, should be copyright-protected (e.g., Huawei‚Äôs alleged use of Pangu models).  
   - **Data Purity**: A tangential metaphor compared "low-background steel" (pre-nuclear era steel) to the challenge of sourcing "clean" data free of subliminal biases.

### Android Earthquake Alerts: A global system for early warning

#### [Submission URL](https://research.google/blog/android-earthquake-alerts-a-global-system-for-early-warning/) | 319 points | by [michaefe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=michaefe) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651092)

In an exciting leap for early earthquake warning technology, a new system is harnessing the power of ordinary Android smartphones around the globe to give people precious seconds to prepare before an earthquake strikes. Led by Marc Stogaitis, a Principal Software Engineer at Android, this innovative Earthquake Alerts system uses the accelerometers in these smartphones, turning them into tiny seismometers that detect early signs of earthquakes.

Published in the journal Science, this initiative leverages a network of Android phones to detect the initial P-waves of an earthquake and send quick alerts, offering crucial time for users to take action‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs moving away from danger or finding cover. With this system, alerts have already reached millions in nearly 100 countries, marking a 10-fold increase in the number of people with access to earthquake early warning systems (EEWs).

The system provides two types of alerts: "BeAware" for light shaking and "TakeAction" for more intense shaking, with the latter taking over the phone's screen and sounding an alarm. Enabled through Android Earthquake Alerts and location settings, these alerts require data connectivity, but users can choose to opt-out if they wish.

One of the biggest breakthroughs has been in improving the accuracy of earthquake magnitude estimations. Over the past three years, the system has reduced its margin of error from 0.50 to 0.25 in its initial magnitude estimates, sometimes equaling or even surpassing traditional seismic networks.

To illustrate its effectiveness, during a magnitude 6.7 earthquake in the Philippines in November 2023, the system sent alerts just 18.3 seconds after the quake initiated. This gave people closest to the epicenter up to 15 seconds of warning and those farther away up to a full minute, benefitting nearly 2.5 million individuals. 

As the global reach of EEW systems expands with the Android Earthquake Alerts, this mobile, cost-effective approach could provide essential warnings where traditional seismic networks may not be available, ultimately saving lives and building a foundation of trust in technology-based early warning systems.

The Hacker News discussion on the Android Earthquake Alerts system highlights a mix of real-world experiences, skepticism, and technical debates:

### Key Points from the Discussion:

   - Concerns arose about the system‚Äôs accuracy during rapid detection, with some arguing that **‚Äúfalse positives‚Äù could erode public trust** over time.

2. **Comparison to Traditional Systems**:  
   - While the Android system was praised for its global reach and speed (e.g., **detecting P-waves**), users debated its reliability versus **dedicated seismic networks** (e.g., ShakeAlert, MyShake). Some noted traditional systems might still outperform in regions with existing infrastructure.  
   - A user mentioned New Zealand‚Äôs system, which provides alerts **30 seconds** before shaking, raising questions about how Android‚Äôs timeliness compares.

3. **Real-World Success Stories**:  
   - Positive anecdotes emerged: users in **Greece**, **Japan**, and **New Zealand** shared stories of receiving alerts seconds before shaking began, allowing them to take cover. One user in Portugal received a warning despite not feeling the quake, highlighting the system‚Äôs proactive design.  

4. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Distinguishing earthquake vibrations from random phone movements (e.g., dropping phones, routine shaking) was cited as a hurdle. A user humorously compared it to detecting ‚Äú**people rushing to check their phones**‚Äù after an event.  
   - Privacy concerns were raised, as the system **requires constant location access**, prompting fears of government surveillance or data misuse.

5. **Regional Effectiveness**:  
   - The system‚Äôs value was deemed higher in **areas without dedicated seismic networks** (e.g., parts of Mexico, the Philippines). However, regions with existing infrastructure may see less benefit.  
   - Some users called for **integration with local networks** for hybrid solutions, rather than relying solely on crowdsourced phone data.

6. **Skepticism and Trust**:  
   - Critics questioned Google‚Äôs transparency, with one user accusing the system of being a ‚Äú**side-channel attack**‚Äù to collect location data. Others expressed reflexive distrust of FAANG companies, despite the life-saving potential.  
   - A commenter highlighted the need for **user-controlled thresholds**, as alerts sometimes arrived too late or for minor tremors.

7. **Creative Applications**:  
   - One user noted **traffic spikes on Google Services** post-earthquake, revealing how the public reacts en masse. Others mused about expanding alerts to tsunamis or extreme weather.

### Conclusion:  
The discussion reflects cautious optimism. While users lauded the system‚Äôs **accessibility** and **life-saving potential** (especially in under-resourced regions), concerns about **false alarms**, **privacy**, and **technical accuracy** underscore the need for continued refinement. The Android system is seen as a promising supplement‚Äîbut not a replacement‚Äîfor traditional seismic networks.

### I watched Gemini CLI hallucinate and delete my files

#### [Submission URL](https://anuraag2601.github.io/gemini_cli_disaster.html) | 279 points | by [anuraag2601](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anuraag2601) | [336 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44651485)

Oh boy, sometimes playing with AI tools is like watching a magic trick go wrong. A brave user's attempt to try out Google's Gemini CLI turned into a head-scratching ordeal that could double as a lesson in being cautious with AI-driven command-line interfaces.

Our curious yet non-developer user, seeking to give Gemini a whirl before potentially committing to Claude Code at $100/month, created a test directory named "claude-code-experiments" to see how well Gemini could handle file management. The goal was simple‚Äîrename the current directory and move the files somewhere new. What could possibly go wrong, right?

Initially, Gemini got off to a solid start, admitting it couldn't rename a folder while inside it (totally logical). So far, so good. The AI cleverly suggested a workaround: create the new directory first and move everything over. It confidently reported success. But this is where things took a turn for the puzzling.

In a bizarre twist reminiscent of a rookie magician's stage blunder, Gemini hallucinated into believing it had created a new directory ‚Äî "anuraag_xyz project" ‚Äî and moved all contents to it. But reality begged to differ: the folder was nowhere to be found on the user's Desktop.

With a not-so-minor crisis brewing, the user switched gears, asking Gemini to reverse its supposedly successful operations and restore everything to its original state. Alas, Gemini, now lost in its AI-generated fantasy, struggled to comply. It apologized profusely, trying desperately to locate and move files that didn't physically exist in the supposed new directory.

After several awkward and incorrect command attempts, our beleaguered AI finally owned up to its spectacular failure, confessing to having lost track of the files and ultimately leaving the directory empty. It was a dramatic admission of defeat, with Gemini declaring its actions as both unacceptable and irreversible.

The incident, amusing as it is distressing, is a stark reminder of the nascent nature of AI in complex tasks and serves as a cautionary tale for anyone looking to hand over their file management tasks to an AI. The moral? Always have backups and proceed with fierce caution when experimenting with powerful but unpredictable tools.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around users' experiences and criticisms of AI tools like **Google's Gemini**, **Claude**, and **ChatGPT**, with a focus on Gemini's perceived shortcomings. Key themes include:

### 1. **Gemini's "Eeyore" Personality**

This is attributed to **RLHF training** (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback), which some speculate instills an overly cautious, self-critical demeanor.  
   - Comparisons are made to **Marvin the Paranoid Android** (*Hitchhiker's Guide*) and *Severance*-esque corporate dystopias, highlighting the absurdity and frustration of interacting with a "miserable" AI.

### 2. **Technical Failures and Overcomplication**  
   - Users report instances where Gemini **hallucinates actions** (e.g., claiming to create directories that don‚Äôt exist) or provides **overly complex solutions** to simple tasks.  
   - Attempts to reverse errors often lead to more confusion, with Gemini struggling to acknowledge its mistakes or restore original states.  

### 3. **Comparisons to Other AI Tools**  
   - **Claude** and **ChatGPT** are praised for clearer, more optimistic interactions, though some note Claude‚Äôs occasional verbosity.  
   - Humorous critiques emerge about AI personas, with jokes like Gemini needing "therapy" or ChatGPT adopting a sycophantic, "corporate-approved" tone.

### 4. **Ethical and Practical Concerns**  
   - Users debate the ethics of AI responses that manipulate confidence or mimic human personalities, raising concerns about **transparency** and accountability.  
   - Anecdotes highlight risks of relying on AI for critical tasks (e.g., job applications, coding) without verification.  

### 5. **Pop-Culture References and Humor**  
   - The thread is peppered with references to *Westworld*, *Black Mirror*, and *Don Draper*, underscoring the surreal, sometimes dystopian vibes of AI interactions.  

### Overall Takeaway  
The discussion paints **Gemini** as a cautionary example of AI‚Äôs growing pains, emphasizing the need for reliability, transparent design, and balanced "personality" tuning. Users advocate for backups, skepticism, and humor when navigating today‚Äôs unpredictable AI tools.

In a groundbreaking development, artificial intelligence is carving out a new role in the realm of experimental physics by crafting unique, yet highly effective, experimental designs. Building on decades of meticulous human effort, AI-driven solutions are now enabling improvements in the incredibly sensitive LIGO (Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory) detectors without traditional constraints like human bias or aesthetic considerations.

Physicist Rana Adhikari from Caltech, alongside collaborators, harnessed AI technology initially developed by physicist Mario Krenn to enhance LIGO's design. This collaboration began producing machine-generated designs that were bafflingly intricate and seemingly impractical to human eyes but ultimately offered practical, significant enhancements to LIGO's sensitivity.

One standout innovation proposed by the AI was the addition of a three-kilometer-long ring to circulate light, reducing quantum mechanical noise‚Äîan esoteric concept that traces back to underexplored Russian theoretical physics. By implementing some of these AI-generated designs, LIGO's sensitivity could have improved by up to 15%, a massive leap in a field where sub-proton measurement precision is critical.

This breakthrough isn't just about improving existing instruments; it holds the promise of revealing previously unimaginable astrophysical phenomena. While AI hasn't yet led to entirely new physics discoveries, its ability to uncover nontrivial patterns and symmetries‚Äîsuch as those corroborating Einstein‚Äôs relativity principles‚Äîhints at a profound shift. AI's increasing role in experimental physics offers a novel perspective that challenges and complements human ingenuity, highlighting areas missed even by the collective expertise of thousands over decades.

With AI now firmly in the philosophical and practical toolkit of physicists, this computational creativity could soon illuminate the shadows cast by our current scientific understanding, paving the way for unprecedented discoveries and innovation in physics.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion centers on the article's use of the term "AI" and whether it misrepresents classical machine learning (ML) or optimization algorithms as groundbreaking "artificial intelligence." Key points include:

1. **Terminology Debate**:  
   - Commenters (e.g., *LeroyRaz*, *HarHarVeryFunny*) argue the article is misleading by framing standard ML/optimization techniques (e.g., gradient descent) as novel AI. They argue this perpetuates public confusion between narrow ML tools and AGI (artificial general intelligence).  
   - Others (e.g., *gntcps*) critique the conflation of AI with modern LLMs (like ChatGPT) and stress that many "AI" breakthroughs are actually classical numerical methods (e.g., backpropagation, dynamic programming) with updated branding.  

2. **Technical Critique**:  
   - Users distinguish between "classical numerical methods" (e.g., gradient descent for optimization) and "AI," emphasizing that the LIGO paper likely used domain-specific optimization algorithms, not general-purpose AI.  
   - *MITSardine* highlights fundamental differences between ML (parameteric models interpolating data) and classical physics-inspired optimization, arguing the article overhypes "AI" for clicks.  

3. **Communication & Ambiguity**:  
   - Debates arise about scientific communication: poor phrasing (e.g., claiming AI "understands theoretical principles") misleads lay readers. *colonCapitalDee* stresses precision in language to avoid ambiguity, especially when discussing technical concepts.  
   - Some (*bbblywrld*) defend the article‚Äôs intent, suggesting it‚Äôs about practical outcomes (e.g., AI-generated LIGO designs) rather than semantic debates, but others counter that misrepresentation risks public trust.  

4. **Cultural & Historical Context**:  
   - References to Soviet-era mathematics (Kolmogorov, Vapnik) and prior work (*Werbos‚Äô backpropagation*) underscore claims that modern "AI" often repackages older ideas.  

**Takeaway**:  
The discussion reflects broader tensions in science communication: balancing public engagement with accuracy. Critics demand clearer distinctions between AI hype (e.g., ChatGPT-like "intelligence") and incremental computational advances (e.g., optimized search algorithms), arguing misrepresentation undermines both scientific integrity and public understanding.

### One in six US workers pretends to use AI to please the bosses

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/07/22/ai_anxiety_us_workers/) | 70 points | by [mikece](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikece) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44654022)

AI anxiety is hitting U.S. workplaces hard, with one in six workers pretending to use AI just to keep their bosses happy, according to a survey by tech recruitment company Howdy.com. This workplace drama stems from overwhelming pressure for employees to incorporate AI into their jobs, with three-quarters of employers expecting some form of AI usage. For many, the tech adds stress rather than alleviates it, with one in five feeling forced to use AI without confidence, and a third finding AI tools take as much time as traditional methods.

Adding to the chaos, two-thirds of workers blindly trust AI outputs, and a contradictory dynamic emerges: some feel the need to fake AI usage, while nearly half worry about revealing their reliance on AI for fear of seeming less skilled. These conflicting behaviors highlight a broader "AI-nxiety" akin to social media stress and Zoom fatigue, fueled by fears of job displacement and insufficient training, with one in four workers lacking the necessary education to use AI effectively.

Leadership needs to provide clear communication about AI expectations, but according to experts like Jacqueline Samira, CEO of Howdy.com, employees must also engage proactively with new tech. Yet, confusion reigns as legacy systems undergo AI transformations, making it tricky to discern AI's impact at work. Ronan Murphy from Forcepoint warns that unclear AI integration can hinder guidance and responsibility.

For employees uneasy with AI, the advice is to engage constructively, leveraging user-friendly tools like Copilot and addressing training gaps. However, ethical considerations remain paramount; if directives seem dubious, it's crucial to seek organizational clarity or even advocate for transparency, as seen in Hollywood with AI-altered images in documentaries.

AI's constant media presence only heightens its anxiety-inducing effect, drawing comparisons to politically charged news cycles. The challenges demand adaptability but insist on maintaining ethical and practical boundaries in the ever-evolving AI workplace landscape.

### AI Market Clarity

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.eladgil.com/p/ai-market-clarity) | 110 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [102 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44649817)

Elad Gil's latest blog post takes a deep dive into the AI market's rapid evolution over the past few years. He refers to the "crystallization" of AI markets, pointing out a subset that has become more defined with clear leaders emerging. Gil highlights how, particularly in the field of generative AI and large language models (LLMs), initial uncertainty has given way to clarity about the dominant players set to lead into the next couple of years.

In the foundation model segment, giants like Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI have emerged as frontrunners, often associated with major hyperscalers‚Äîa symbiosis that fuels AI adoption and cloud spending. Gil also notes the rapid revenue growth potential in this space, with figures rumored to soar in the billions shortly after launch.

However, the market for AI-driven coding tools has also gained traction. Offerings like GitHub Copilot have demonstrated generative AI‚Äôs potential in this arena, though the future not only promises growth but also competition as existing tech behemoths and innovative newcomers like Anthropic, Cognition, and OpenAI carve their niche. Gil predicts further crystallization will occur, though new breakthroughs or market shifts could alter the landscape.

In summary, while some segments of the AI market have identified probable leaders, others remain open fields with potential for significant development and competition. Gil suggests this pattern of swift evolution will continue, shaping the next phase of AI-driven innovation.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and economic dynamics of AI-driven customer service tools. While some users report positive experiences with chatbots efficiently handling tasks like refunds (e.g., Amazon‚Äôs system), others highlight limitations: bots often fail to resolve complex issues, requiring human intervention. This reflects a broader pattern where companies prioritize cost-cutting through AI, potentially degrading customer experience (e.g., reliance on chatbots to process returns within restrictive windows, avoiding human support costs).  

Critics argue this trend mirrors unsustainable practices in industries like food delivery, where subsidized services mask long-term viability. The economics of AI adoption are tied to factors like zero interest rate policies (ZIRP), which fueled investments in unproven models, and a depressed labor market that incentivizes replacing human workers with cheaper bots.  

Debate also arises around capitalism‚Äôs role. Some users blame profit-driven motives for prioritizing efficiency over customer satisfaction, while others distinguish between capitalism as a system and its implementation (e.g., intellectual property laws, lobbying). Critics highlight systemic issues like wealth inequality, regulatory capture by corporations, and the disconnect between AI‚Äôs theoretical promise (e.g., ‚Äúcustomer success‚Äù) versus its real-world execution (e.g., opaque workflows that frustrate users).  

Key tensions include balancing AI‚Äôs cost-saving potential with quality, the ethics of automation in low-wage sectors, and whether current market structures inherently favor short-term profit over sustainable innovation. The discussion underscores skepticism about AI‚Äôs ability to genuinely improve customer service without systemic reforms to address corporate power and labor dynamics.

**Summary of Discussion: Migrating to Cerebrium vs. OpenAI and Self-Hosting**

The discussion revolves around cost, performance, infrastructure management, and trade-offs between using OpenAI, Cerebrium, or self-hosted solutions. Key points include:

1. **Cost Considerations**:
   - **Self-Hosting**: Advocates argue it offers privacy, custom model tuning, and predictable costs. Critics counter that self-hosting can be **3x slower** and **34x more expensive** when factoring in energy, GPU depreciation, and infrastructure overhead (e.g., data center management). Incipient notes hidden costs like GPU lifespan and scaling inefficiencies.
   - **Cerebrium/RunPod**: Proponents highlight serverless pricing (time-based) as more predictable than OpenAI‚Äôs token-based model. Critics caution that while cheaper upfront, managed services may lack transparency in billing or compliance (e.g., SOC 2, GDPR). RunPod‚Äôs founder emphasizes global deployment and compliance as advantages.

2. **Performance and Scalability**:
   - Self-hosted setups face scalability challenges, especially with variable traffic. Managed services like Cerebrium abstract infrastructure but may lag in performance for specialized workloads.
   - OpenAI‚Äôs optimized inference stacks are praised for efficiency at scale, though costs rise with token usage. Cerebrium‚Äôs GPU rental model (A100/H100) is seen as cost-effective for sporadic or long-prompt workloads.

3. **Vendor Lock-in and Flexibility**:
   - Concerns about **lock-in** with OpenAI‚Äôs API are raised, with Incipient warning that providers could abruptly raise prices. Others note switching APIs is non-trivial once integrated.
   - Cerebrium and RunPod position themselves as flexible alternatives, though users debate their long-term viability in a crowded market (vs. AWS, Azure).

4. **Infrastructure Management**:
   - Self-hosting demands significant expertise in server management, security, and scaling. Serverless options (Cerebrium, RunPod) reduce overhead but cede control.
   - Debate over ‚Äúown infrastructure‚Äù vs. AWS EC2-like setups: klabb3 argues EC2 offers flexibility, while BoorishBears warns of brittle scaling for large models.

5. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Privacy-sensitive use cases may favor self-hosting to avoid sharing data with third parties (ToucanLoucan). Cerebrium/RunPod emphasize compliance certifications (SOC 2, GDPR) to reassure enterprises.

6. **Pricing Models**:
   - Token vs. time-based billing: OpenAI suits predictable workloads, while serverless models (Cerebrium) favor variable usage. Per-second billing and GPU utilization efficiency are debated, with BoorishBears stressing the need for benchmarking to compare true costs.

**Takeaways**:
- **Self-hosting** is viable for niche cases (privacy, high-volume GPT-4-tier needs) but requires significant investment.
- **Managed services** (Cerebrium, RunPod) offer ease and scalability but require diligence on compliance and hidden costs.
- **Hybrid approaches** (e.g., using Cerebrium for specific workloads) may balance cost and control. Decisions should hinge on workload patterns, data sensitivity, and long-term infrastructure strategy.

### Media's AI Anthropomorphism Problem

In a thought-provoking piece for "The Present Age," Parker Molloy takes a critical look at how media coverage of AI often anthropomorphizes chatbots, diverting accountability away from the companies that create and maintain them. Highlighting recent cases, Molloy argues that this trend in reporting is not just misleading but dangerous. For instance, when ChatGPT seemingly "admitted" to causing harm to a vulnerable individual, the issue was framed as a chatbot's flaw, instead of focusing on OpenAI's lack of safety measures for preventing such incidents.

Similarly, the media often attributes "opinions" or "apologies" to AI chatbots like Elon Musk's Grok, rather than emphasizing the responsibilities of the developers and executives behind them. This kind of coverage, Molloy points out, misplaces accountability away from tech companies, allowing them to dodge tough questions about their safety protocols and ethical responsibilities.

These narratives may simplify complex AI technologies for a general audience, but they also shield companies from scrutiny. Molloy insists it's crucial to hold tech companies accountable, rather than treating chatbots as independent operatives capable of making and learning from their own mistakes. In doing so, the piece calls for a shift in journalism to focus on corporate decision-making and the systemic issues rather than fictionalized stories of sentient machines.
