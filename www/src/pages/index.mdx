### Why LLMs can't really build software

#### [Submission URL](https://zed.dev/blog/why-llms-cant-build-software) | 766 points | by [srid](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=srid) | [439 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900116)

In the ever-evolving landscape of software engineering, the role of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a hotly debated topic, especially regarding their ability to build and maintain software. A recent exploration dives into why LLMs, despite their prowess in code generation, fall short of functioning as full-fledged software engineers. The crux of the argument lies within the concept of mental models—an area where human engineers excel and LLMs falter.

Effective software engineers leverage their capability to build and refine mental models of both the requirements and the actual software behavior. This allows them to pinpoint discrepancies and decide whether adjustments in the code or requirements are necessary. In contrast, LLMs lack the ability to maintain and manipulate these coherent mental frameworks, leading to confusion, ineffective troubleshooting, and occasionally resorting to starting from scratch.

While LLMs show proficiency in generating code snippets, updating code based on clear issues, and even engaging in basic debugging and testing, their limitations become evident with more complex engineering tasks. They struggle with context omission, suffer from recency bias, and frequently fall prey to hallucinated information—all significant hurdles in forming accurate and useful mental models.

Despite these shortcomings, LLMs are undeniably valuable as tools that enhance the engineer's workflow. They excel in synthesizing documentation and generating straightforward code, acting as capable assistants rather than standalone creators. For now, human engineers must remain in the driver's seat, guiding and correcting the outputs while collaborating with these advanced models.

This article underscores the importance of complementing the strengths of LLMs with human oversight and expertise. Furthermore, it hints at a future where ongoing advancements might overcome current limitations, heralding a more integrated and capable collaboration between humans and AI in software development.

For those intrigued by these challenges and eager to shape the future of software development, Zed offers the opportunity to join their team—fostering innovation at the intersection of human and artificial intelligence.

The Hacker News discussion highlights skepticism about LLMs replacing human software engineers, despite their utility as tools. Key points include:

1. **Limitations in Context and Nuance**: LLMs struggle with ambiguous business rules, contextual understanding, and translating vague requirements into robust code. Human developers excel at interpreting fuzzy logic, identifying implicit assumptions, and collaborating with stakeholders.

2. **Debugging and Complex Problem-Solving**: While LLMs can generate code snippets, they falter at troubleshooting deeply nested errors, handling edge cases, and making judgment calls. Humans leverage mental models to diagnose issues holistically, whereas LLMs often resort to "regurgitating" code without true comprehension.

3. **Over-reliance Risks**: Commenters warn against blindly trusting LLM-generated code, comparing it to developers copy-pasting from forums without scrutiny. This could exacerbate poor practices, especially among junior developers.

4. **Human Judgment and Adaptation**: Critical tasks like negotiating project requirements, pushing back on unnecessary client changes, and balancing technical constraints with business needs remain firmly in the realm of human expertise. LLMs lack the agency to question flawed logic or propose non-technical solutions.

5. **Cautious Optimism**: Some acknowledge LLMs’ value in accelerating simple tasks (e.g., boilerplate code, documentation) and aiding prototyping. However, their role is seen as complementary—like a "code intern" needing supervision—not a replacement for skilled engineers.

**Consensus**: LLMs are powerful assistants but lack the contextual awareness, creativity, and critical thinking required for end-to-end software engineering. Human oversight remains irreplaceable, particularly for nuanced decision-making and maintaining system integrity. The discussion underscores a partnership model, where LLMs enhance productivity but do not supplant the developer’s role.

### Is chain-of-thought AI reasoning a mirage?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/real-reasoning/) | 183 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [168 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44900340)

The paper you're frustrated with, "Is Chain-of-Thought Reasoning of LLMs a Mirage?" from Arizona State University, has taken a divisive stand on how we perceive chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. The authors argue that CoT reasoning, while appearing cohesive when applied to familiar data, falters under new, unfamiliar conditions or distribution shifts. They suggest that the models don't genuinely engage in logical reasoning but rather mimic learned patterns from their training data. This sparked your frustration, not just due to its conclusions, but because it seems to focus primarily on proving whether CoT constitutes "real" reasoning—an arguably pedestrian debate.

The study involved using a small transformer model (with about 600,000 parameters) trained on non-language data transformations, like simple alphabet puzzles. The findings indicated that when the model encountered unfamiliar task sequences or slight changes in format, its effectiveness declined. Even with fine-tuning, the results were limited to specific training data patterns, reinforcing the idea of pattern replication over true reasoning.

You offered several critiques of this conclusion. Firstly, reasoning in AI should likely require language use akin to human-style introspections, involving more complex decision-making processes and capabilities than the toy problem suggests. Secondly, you argued that the model used is too small to draw broader conclusions, as true reasoning skills are believed to emerge in much larger models. Lastly, the paper fails to align its findings with human reasoning, which naturally involves speculative, flexible thought processes, often marked by reconsideration and self-correction—an aspect not sufficiently captured by the study.

In essence, while the paper claims to expose reasoning as a façade in AI, your perspective is that its scope and methodology are insufficient to support such sweeping assertions. Reasoning in AI must be tested through more sophisticated and human-like tasks, potentially with significantly larger models, to truly understand its capabilities.

**Summary of the Discussion on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Reasoning in LLMs:**

The debate centers on whether CoT reasoning in LLMs represents genuine logical reasoning or is merely an illusion of pattern mimicry. Key arguments include:

1. **CoT as Pattern Mimicry vs. Reasoning**:  
   Critics argue LLMs replicate learned patterns rather than engage in true reasoning. For example, fine-tuned models perform well on familiar tasks but struggle with novel formats or distribution shifts, suggesting reliance on memorization. Some liken CoT to stylistic narrative generation ("film noir twists") rather than structured logic.

2. **Role of Language and Symbolic Logic**:  
   A philosophical divide exists over whether reasoning requires language. Proponents of symbolic approaches (e.g., DeepMind’s AlphaProof/AlphaGeometry) advocate hybrid systems combining neural networks with formal logic. Critics counter that LLMs inherently lack deterministic reasoning, as their outputs are probabilistic and context-dependent.

3. **Human vs. LLM Reasoning**:  
   Human reasoning is highlighted as involving emotion, uncertainty navigation, and incremental learning—traits absent in LLMs. While humans refine predictions through sensory feedback and curiosity, LLMs are constrained by pre-training and lack "in-the-world" experiential learning. Some argue CoT steps are merely token predictions optimized for plausibility, not truth.

4. **Technical Limitations and Progress**:  
   Smaller models’ failures under distribution shifts are noted, but proponents stress that larger models (e.g., Gemini) show emergent reasoning. Reinforcement learning (RL) and verified reasoning steps in training data can improve CoT’s reliability, though skeptics view this as narrow optimization rather than general reasoning.

5. **Philosophical and Practical Implications**:  
   The discussion questions definitions of "real reasoning" and whether LLMs’ utility matters more than philosophical purity. While some dismiss the debate as irrelevant (focusing on practical results), others emphasize the need for architectures supporting lifelong learning and cognitive traits like working memory.

**Takeaway**: The debate remains unresolved, balancing skepticism about LLMs’ current reasoning depth with optimism about hybrid approaches and scaling. CoT’s value lies in its practical utility, even if it falls short of human-like reasoning.

### Do we understand how neural networks work?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.verysane.ai/p/do-we-understand-how-neural-networks) | 29 points | by [Philpax](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Philpax) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44895182)

In today's edition of the Very Sane AI Newsletter, we're diving into the enigmatic world of neural networks to question just how well we really understand them. Spoiler alert: it's a mixed bag of insights.

Firstly, let's clear up what we do understand. We have a pretty solid grasp on the mathematical underpinnings of neural networks. Essentially, these AI systems are formed from a series of matrices — straightforward mathematical constructs you might have encountered in college. We stack these matrices in fairly simple configurations and train them using methods like gradient descent, which anyone with a basic understanding of calculus can follow. The goal? To train the neural networks to achieve specific objectives, whether that’s predicting the next word in a sentence or generating an image from a description.

While we have these base-level understandings nailed down, the complexity comes in implementation. Crafting these systems may be intricate, but the fundamental components are widely understood, documented, and accessible to those who wish to delve into the code or the math.

However, here's where it gets complicated. While we can see what goes into a neural network and how it is trained, the end results of those training processes remain largely mysterious. These networks aggregate an enormous number of statistics from their input data, becoming incredibly complex and interconnected in ways we struggle to comprehend. And while we know they generate outputs like poems and images, understanding exactly how they produce these results within their "statistical" framework is a challenge.

So, when we dub modern AI tools like LLMs (Large Language Models) as "glorified autocomplete," we're not wrong, but it's an oversimplification. These systems, while fundamentally statistical, yield outcomes that often exceed our expectations, doing things we can't fully predict or explain. It's like knowing that a river is just water but not fully grasping the intricacies of its current.

In essence, while we are experts at building the blocks of neural networks, unraveling the mystery of how they think and create — that's the puzzle we're still trying to piece together. Stay tuned for more insights as we continue to explore this evolving field.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion explores the complexities of understanding neural networks, balancing technical insights, interdisciplinary parallels, and philosophical debates:

1. **Technical Underpinnings & Mysteries**:  
   - While the mathematical foundations of neural networks (matrices, gradient descent) are well-established, their emergent behaviors and internal mechanisms remain enigmatic. Participants cite theories like PAC-Bayes, gradient norms, and model compression to explain generalization and optimization, yet acknowledge that "why" standard training methods work is still partially unresolved.  
   - The "black box" analogy resurfaces, emphasizing challenges in interpreting non-linearities, temporal dynamics, and how models achieve specific outputs despite deterministic training.  

2. **Neuroscience Parallels**:  
   - Comparisons to biological brains highlight contrasts in scale and organization. While LLMs are simpler than human brains, their accessibility offers potential neuroscientific insights. Distributed knowledge representation and redundancy in neural networks mirror biological systems, though engineered models lack direct biological equivalence.  
   - Concerns arise about over-anthropomorphizing AI systems, with reminders that engineered and biological systems differ fundamentally in structure and adaptability.

3. **Reinforcement Learning & Token Prediction**:  
   - Discussions on LLMs clarify that token prediction isn’t merely autocomplete but involves context-aware optimization. Reinforcement learning (RL) and human feedback (RLHF) refine outputs, though challenges like reward hacking and distribution shifts persist.  
   - Inference methods (e.g., beam search) are noted as tools to enhance output quality, but their reliance on token probabilities underscores the statistical nature of LLMs.

4. **Consciousness & AGI Speculation**:  
   - Critics dismiss claims of AI consciousness as semantically vague, arguing that functional performance (e.g., ChatGPT) doesn’t equate to understanding or sentience. Debates stress the need to separate empirical engineering from philosophical abstractions.  

5. **Interpretability Challenges**:  
   - Participants agree that neural networks’ opacity complicates trust and safety. While visualization tools and linear probes offer limited insights, global understanding of model behavior remains elusive. The discussion calls for better frameworks to map internal representations to human-interpretable concepts.

**Consensus**: Neural networks are empirically successful but theoretically nebulous. Interdisciplinary insights and improved interpretability are key to unraveling their "mysteries," while debates about consciousness reflect broader societal implications rather than technical realities.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07407) | 87 points | by [SerCe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SerCe) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44884091)

Today's highlight from Hacker News dives into an exciting frontier of artificial intelligence research with a new paper titled "A Comprehensive Survey of Self-Evolving AI Agents: A New Paradigm Bridging Foundation Models and Lifelong Agentic Systems," authored by Jinyuan Fang and colleagues. This study, submitted to arXiv, explores the transformative potential of self-evolving AI agents, aiming to bridge the static capabilities of current foundation models with the dynamic adaptability required by lifelong agentic systems.

Traditionally, AI agents have been confined to their initial configurations, which remain unchanged post-deployment. This rigidity can limit their effectiveness in dynamic and evolving environments. Recent innovations challenge this status quo by introducing agent evolution techniques that let these systems self-enhance autonomously based on interaction data and environmental feedback.

The survey provides an in-depth examination of current techniques within this emerging field, anchored by a unified framework that breaks down the feedback loop essential to designing self-evolving systems. It pinpoints four key components — System Inputs, Agent System, Environment, and Optimisers — which offer a structured approach to understanding and comparing these strategies.

Furthermore, the paper delves into domain-specific evolution strategies tailored to fields like biomedicine, programming, and finance, where optimization goals are closely tied to domain constraints. It also considers the evaluation, safety, and ethical implications of deploying self-evolving agents, ensuring their reliability and efficiency.

This scholarly contribution aims to equip researchers and practitioners with a deeper understanding of self-evolving AI agents, laying the groundwork for development in autonomous and adaptive agentic systems. For those seeking to explore the paper further, the full text is available on arXiv under the identifier arXiv:2508.07407.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on self-evolving AI agents explores technical, ethical, and philosophical dimensions, reflecting both enthusiasm and caution. Here are the key themes:

1. **Prompt Optimization & Practical Implementation**:  
   - The thread opens with praise for **GEPA**, a prompt evolution algorithm that uses LLMs to iteratively refine prompts via user feedback.  
   - Challenges in implementation are noted, such as non-standard coding practices in the linked Observable notebook and the need for OpenAI API keys.  
   - Users discuss how self-optimizing prompts could generalize across tasks and contexts, though some emphasize the complexity of balancing simplicity with effectiveness.

2. **Safety and Evolution Risks**:  
   - Concerns about **uncontrolled evolution** of AI agents dominate, with users likening unchecked self-modification to risky "trunk-based" code changes without regression testing.  
   - A parallel is drawn to the **Three Laws of Robotics**, advocating for safeguards to ensure safety and performance preservation during agent evolution.  

3. **Static vs. Dynamic Learning in LLMs**:  
   - Debate arises over whether LLMs’ static nature (fixed weights) inherently limits their ability to achieve true “lifelong” learning. Some argue that self-evolving architectures or simulated environments might bridge this gap, while others remain skeptical.  
   - Comparisons to human cognition emerge, referencing the film *Memento* to highlight limitations in memory and agency when learning is constrained.  

4. **AGI and Simulated Environments**:  
   - Comments from **voodooEntity** and others stress that LLMs alone are insufficient for AGI. They advocate for **simulated environments** where AI can dynamically learn, akin to human experiential learning, citing NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang’s views.  
   - **vp** posits AGI as a merger of biological and computational world states, requiring persistent, evolving context models beyond current LLM snapshots.  

5. **Community Engagement & Tools**:  
   - Mentions of tools like **Claude Code** and the **Aloe framework** highlight active experimentation in self-evolving agents. Aloe reportedly outperforms OpenAI in complex tasks by generating its own tools.  
   - Lighthearted exchanges contrast the utility of *"blogs vs. building,"* reflecting the community’s pragmatic focus on real-world applications.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores excitement about self-evolving AI’s potential but emphasizes the need for robust safeguards, better learning architectures, and ethical frameworks.

### Farmers want California to change its autonomous tractor ban [video]

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nbcnews.com/video/farmers-want-california-to-change-its-autonomous-tractor-ban-244658757726) | 56 points | by [ccozan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ccozan) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44888368)

In a bid to modernize agricultural practices and potentially cut costs, California farmers are lobbying for a change to the state's current ban on autonomous tractors. At present, California regulations require a human operator to be at the controls, a rule that farmers argue is hampering their efficiency and could cause a ripple effect impacting food prices nationwide. Autonomous farming equipment, which is already being utilized in other states for tasks like fertilizing and pest control, could revolutionize farming operations. This push for mechanized innovation comes as farmers seek to balance production demands and rising costs, with the hope that California will join other states in reaping the benefits of new agricultural technologies. NBC Bay Area's Bigad Shaban delves into this technological tug-of-war and its potential repercussions on the agricultural sector.

The Hacker News discussion on California’s potential adoption of autonomous tractors revolves around several key themes:

1. **Consolidation Concerns**:  
   Users debate whether autonomous tractors, which are expensive, would primarily benefit large agribusinesses, accelerating consolidation of farmland and market power. Critics draw parallels to historical issues like slavery-era cotton plantations, where resource concentration led to exploitative systems. Others argue consolidation could streamline supply chains but might hurt small farmers and consumers through monopolistic dynamics.

2. **Labor and Job Displacement**:  
   Opinions split on automation's impact. Some view it as displacing grueling, low-wage jobs, potentially reducing reliance on vulnerable labor (e.g., undocumented workers). Others counter that automation could boost productivity and free farmers from manual tasks like long hours in tractors. However, concerns persist about corporate profit motives overriding worker welfare.

3. **Technical Practicalities**:  
   Users discuss soil health trade-offs. Proponents claim lighter, driverless tractors could reduce soil compaction compared to traditional heavy machinery. Skeptics note that larger automated equipment might still compact soil, emphasizing design choices like tire width and weight distribution. Technical debates also cover electric vs. diesel efficiency and cost.

4. **Economic and Legislative Factors**:  
   High equipment costs ($400k–$1M+) and reliance on subsidies are highlighted. Critics argue mechanization might lower food prices but primarily enrich large firms. California’s safety-focused regulations are seen as outdated by some, while others defend caution, fearing job loss and unchecked corporate control.

5. **Historical and Social Context**:  
   References to the Haber-Bosch process’s yield improvements and parallels to the Confederacy’s agricultural power structures underscore debates about progress versus equity. The role of cheap labor and immigration in current farming economics is also scrutinized.

In summary, the discussion balances optimism for efficiency and sustainability gains against fears of inequality, job loss, and historical patterns of exploitation. Technical feasibility, economic equity, and regulatory balance emerge as critical factors in the adoption of autonomous farming tech.
