### Polish radio station ditches DJs, journalists for AI-generated college kids

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/10/25/polish_radio_station_ai_hosts/) | 24 points | by [Brajeshwar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41946386)

In a controversial move, OFF Radio Krakow, a Polish radio station, is replacing its human DJs and journalists with AI-generated hosts, designed to appeal to Gen Z listeners. The station has introduced three AI personas named "Emi," "Kuba," and "Alex," who interact with audiences using content prepared by human journalists but delivered in a digital format. This shift, described by the station's editor as an experiment to explore AI's societal impact, follows significant layoffs among on-air staff, drawing backlash from former employees who argue this transition illustrates the broader threats AI poses to human jobs in creative industries.

The editor, Marcin Pulit, insists that the move is not solely about cutting costs, claiming it will foster discussions about AI's implications for culture and journalism. However, skeptics see it as a cynical attempt to save money amid financial strains on the station, which is undergoing restructuring after a government-led liquidation of regional public broadcasters. Interestingly, the station plans to run this AI experiment for a limited time to gauge its overall effectiveness, indicating that even digital hosts don't guarantee a long-term strategy.

The discussion surrounding OFF Radio Krakow's decision to replace human DJs with AI-hosted personas has ignited a wide range of opinions among commenters. Some users express concern about the implications of this move in the context of Poland's demographic landscape, citing the country's young population and heavy Catholic influence, which complicates the conversation around AI in media. 

Other commenters reflect on the nostalgia of radio and the importance of personal connections in broadcasting, emphasizing that AI-generated content lacks the authenticity and engagement that human hosts provide. The transition to AI is seen as a threat to employment in creative fields, with some pointing out that this shift could lead to a broader trend in media where quality and personal touch might be sacrificed for cost-saving measures.

There’s a mix of skepticism and curiosity about the experiment's outcomes, with some mentioning the potential for increased listenership despite the criticism. Some discussions draw parallels to virtual idols like Hatsune Miku, questioning the long-term viability and acceptance of AI in entertainment. In summary, while there is excitement about AI's potential, many remain wary of its implications for employment and the essence of creative industries.
