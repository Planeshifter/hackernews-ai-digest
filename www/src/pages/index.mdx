### SeedLM: Compressing LLM Weights into Seeds of Pseudo-Random Generators

#### [Submission URL](https://machinelearning.apple.com/research/seedlm-compressing) | 165 points | by [pizza](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pizza) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43599967)

In the ever-evolving field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), the challenge of deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) efficiently has reached a breakthrough with the introduction of SeedLM, presented at the ICLR 2025 conference. This paper by Rasoul Shafipour and co-authors rolls out a game-changing compression method that could redefine how NLP models manage time and resource demands.

SeedLM operates by transforming the cumbersome weight files of LLMs into seeds for a pseudo-random generator, specifically leveraging a Linear Feedback Shift Register (LFSR). This technique circumvents the usual bottleneck of memory access during inference, allowing models like Llama3 70B to maintain their zero-shot accuracy even when compressed down to 3- or 4-bit numbers and remaining on par or surpassing current state-of-the-art methods.

This novel approach shines not only because it delivers robust compression ratios but crucially does so without needing additional calibration data‚Äîstreamlining the deployment across a range of tasks without bespoke adjustments. For practitioners deploying models on-device, the implications are significant: a potential fourfold increase in speed over FP16 baselines, as observed in FPGA-based benchmarks, promises enhanced efficiency as model scales continue to grow.

Moreover, the paper reflects on the balance between accuracy and efficiency, a task made easier by SeedLM's data-free compression, which harnesses unused computational capacity for quicker memory-bound processes. This minimization of resource demand makes SeedLM an attractive antidote to the high costs usually associated with running LLMs, paving the way for wider application in both consumer and enterprise systems.

With such advancements, SeedLM represents a beacon of hope for the NLP community, pushing the boundaries of how far and fast LLMs can go without incurring prohibitive costs or complexity increases, all while maintaining top-tier performance.

The Hacker News discussion on SeedLM, a novel LLM compression method, highlights technical debates, comparisons, and skepticism:

1. **Technical Insights & Comparisons**:  
   - Users note SeedLM‚Äôs use of pseudo-random seeds (via LFSR) to compress weights into 3-4 bits, avoiding calibration data. This contrasts with quantization methods like AWQ or OmniQuant, which require training or calibration.  
   - Accuracy debates arise: SeedLM‚Äôs results for models like LLaMA 70B (4-bit: 78.06% vs. FP16 baseline: 79.51%) are seen as competitive but not universally superior. Some argue larger models degrade more gracefully with quantization.  

2. **Implementation Advantages**:  
   - The method‚Äôs simplicity‚Äîgenerating weights on-the-fly via PRNG seeds‚Äîis praised for reducing memory bandwidth and enabling faster inference, especially on memory-bound hardware (e.g., FPGAs).  
   - Unlike quantization-aware training, SeedLM‚Äôs "data-free" approach streamlines deployment but raises questions about handling outlier weights in sparse LLM activations.  

3. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - The paper‚Äôs October 2024 date sparks jokes about it being an April Fools‚Äô prank. Others question the information-theoretic feasibility of compressing models using pseudo-random sequences, comparing it to JPEG‚Äôs DCT or the Library of Babel.  
   - Some liken the approach to ‚Äúlossy compression,‚Äù replacing exact weights with pre-defined patterns, akin to image compression.  

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Discussions link SeedLM to Apple/Meta‚Äôs on-device AI efforts, noting hardware constraints (e.g., iPhones‚Äô 8GB RAM) and the gap between research and productization.  
   - Parallels are drawn to knowledge compression in documentation, emphasizing minimal principles to reconstruct complex systems‚Äîa theme resonating with LLM efficiency goals.  

Overall, the community recognizes SeedLM‚Äôs potential but remains cautious about its claims, balancing excitement for faster, cheaper LLMs with technical scrutiny.

### Open Source Coalition Announces 'Model-Signing' to Strengthen ML Supply Chain

#### [Submission URL](https://pypi.org/project/model-signing/) | 60 points | by [m463](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=m463) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43596543)

In a step forward for machine learning (ML) security, a new tool called "model-signing" has officially launched on PyPI, offering developers a robust method for signing and verifying ML models. This project, released on April 4, 2025, meets the growing demand for secure ML applications amid a rising wave of cyber threats targeting AI models. Created in collaboration with the Open Source Security Foundation, model-signing aims to emulate the protections typical of traditional software supply chains by safeguarding the integrity and origin of ML models.

The tool facilitates the signing process using Sigstore, a transparency log service, which eliminates the need for managing cryptographic keys by using short-lived tokens. However, it also supports traditional signing through public keys and certificates, broadening its applicability. Signatures are stored in a Sigstore bundle in JSON format, ensuring transparency and verifiable integrity for all involved.

Users can leverage a command-line interface (CLI) to sign and verify models, with flexibility across multiple signing methods, including key and certificate-based options. The CLI simplifies the verification process, allowing users to confirm that a model‚Äôs signature stems from a trusted source, thereby ensuring it hasn‚Äôt been altered post-training.

Moreover, model-signing takes advantage of Sigstore‚Äôs transparency logs, which record signing events, enabling discovery and validation. This functionality is further supported by a log monitor being developed for GitHub Actions, providing an additional layer of security for those maintaining signing identities.

This groundbreaking tool is vital for developers and those managing ML models as it safeguards against unauthorized modifications and boosts trust in AI technologies' integrity. To get started, users need Python 3.9 or newer and can explore further through the project's documentation and resources available on GitHub.

The Hacker News discussion on the "model-signing" tool highlights both support for the initiative and key concerns about its scope and practical application. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Composite Hashing for Multi-File Models**: Commenters emphasize that ML models often comprise multiple files, making a single hash insufficient. A composite hash (e.g., aggregating hashes of all files) is necessary to ensure comprehensive integrity verification. The tool addresses this by storing signatures in a Sigstore bundle for transparency.

2. **Broader Security Standards Needed**: While model-signing is praised as a step forward, users stress the need for holistic standards like **C2PA** (for content provenance) and **SLSA** (for supply chain integrity). These could address gaps in verifying training data, model provenance, and inference behavior, which aren‚Äôt covered by signing alone.

3. **Inference-Time Integrity as a Separate Challenge**: A recurring theme is that model signatures verify the model‚Äôs origin and integrity but do not ensure trustworthy outputs during inference. Malicious models or those trained on flawed data could still produce harmful results, requiring separate solutions for runtime verification.

4. **Practical Concerns and Scope**: Some question the practicality of relying solely on hashing, especially if the underlying model software or logic is compromised. Sigstore‚Äôs integration is seen as beneficial, but users highlight the need for additional validation layers (e.g., attesting training processes or monitoring inference behavior).

5. **Limitations Against Malicious Actors**: The tool doesn‚Äôt prevent bad actors from signing models trained on malicious data. Even with valid signatures, users may deploy harmful models unknowingly, necessitating broader checks (e.g., training audits or third-party attestations).

6. **Future Directions**: Optimism exists around projects extending model-signing to include inference validation and tighter integration with frameworks like **SLSA for ML**. Anticipation for ML-specific security features and transparency logs (via Sigstore) is noted as a promising path forward.

**In summary**, the community welcomes model-signing as a foundational tool for securing ML supply chains but emphasizes that it‚Äôs one piece of a larger puzzle. Future efforts should focus on comprehensive standards, provenance tracking, and inference-time verification to fully address AI security challenges.

On Tuesday, the Wikimedia Foundation highlighted a significant challenge it's facing‚Äîthe relentless scraping of data by AI bots is straining Wikipedia's servers. As AI companies seek vast amounts of data for their models, they've increased automated scraping of sites like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons, significantly boosting bandwidth use for multimedia downloads by 50% since early 2024.

This surge in bot traffic, which largely involves crawling lesser-known pages unvisited by human users, is placing an immense burden on Wikimedia's infrastructure. An illustrative moment occurred when Jimmy Carter's Wikipedia page and a related video saw a massive spike in traffic following his death, revealing how bot activity had already stretched Wikimedia's network capacity.

Many of these AI bots flout traditional web standards, like robots.txt, and employ tactics to mimic human users, complicating efforts by Wikimedia's Site Reliability team to manage this issue. This is a broader phenomenon affecting the free and open-source software (FOSS) community, as seen with other platforms facing similar challenges.

In response, Wikimedia is focusing on systemic solutions to advocate for responsible infrastructure use, aiming for collaboration with AI developers to find sustainable ways to support the open knowledge ecosystem without sacrificing infrastructure stability. Without such efforts, the very platforms that have fueled AI advancements may struggle to sustain themselves. Wikimedia's message is poignant: open content access must be balanced with the resources required to sustain it.

The Hacker News discussion about Wikimedia's struggle with AI bot scraping revolves around several key themes:  

### 1. **Criticism of AI Companies**  
   - Users criticize AI developers for scraping aggressively, ignoring standards like `robots.txt`, and straining Wikimedia‚Äôs servers. Some argue that large AI providers (e.g., "the big 5") prioritize speed over efficiency, leading to wasteful resource use and technical incompetence.  
   - **Example**: One user notes that AI companies often scrape obscure, rarely visited pages instead of using Wikipedia‚Äôs freely available databases or torrents, which would reduce server load.  

### 2. **Debate Over LLM Utility vs. Cost**  
   - While some defend LLMs for practical tasks (e.g., summarizing text, answering questions, generating charts from CSV data), others question the ethics and efficiency of using LLMs for trivial or resource-heavy purposes (e.g., passive-aggressive landlord emails).  
   - A recurring point: LLMs often fetch content inefficiently, leading to redundant server requests that human users would never generate.  

### 3. **Infrastructure Strain and Solutions**  
   - Users suggest systemic fixes, such as better caching of frequently accessed URLs or direct database downloads instead of web scraping. Some propose that AI providers should collaborate with Wikimedia to optimize data access.  
   - Skepticism arises about whether AI companies will adopt these solutions, given their focus on rapid data acquisition.  

### 4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about a "dark age" of information if platforms like Wikipedia collapse under AI-driven traffic.  
   - A meta-discussion critiques the irony of AI models relying on open-source knowledge while undermining the infrastructure that sustains it.  

### 5. **Tone and Sentiment**  
   - Frustration dominates, with users accusing AI firms of hypocrisy (profiting from free content while harming its sustainability). Others inject dark humor, like welcoming a "dark age" if Wikipedia fails.  

In summary, the thread reflects tension between AI innovation and ethical/responsible infrastructure use, with calls for collaboration to preserve open knowledge ecosystems.
