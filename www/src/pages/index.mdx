### After AI beat them, professional Go players got better and more creative

#### [Submission URL](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/go) | 398 points | by [iNic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=iNic) | [200 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39972990)

In a surprising turn of events, professional Go players experienced a remarkable surge in performance and creativity following the introduction of AlphaGo, an AI that defeated the best human players. Contrary to suspicions of cheating, these players genuinely improved their game, showcasing a blend of AI-influenced and novel strategies. This transformation in the Go community highlights a common pattern in history where once-"impossible" feats become common standards after initial breakthroughs. Similarly, as seen in chess after DeepBlue's victory, the rise of AI can inspire human players to reach new heights rather than displace them. The shift towards creativity and enhanced skills in Go occurred post-AlphaGo's appearance and was further amplified by the open-source engine Leela Zero, enabling players to deeply understand and leverage AI reasoning. This phenomenon hints at the untapped potential across various competitive domains, suggesting that AI could propel individuals to surpass existing limitations and excel further.

Ultimately, the partnership between AI and human ingenuity could lead to a resurgence of innovation and excellence, pushing the boundaries of what was once deemed unattainable.

The discussion on Hacker News centered around the impact of AI on professional Go and chess players, drawing parallels between the introduction of AI like AlphaGo and DeepBlue to the subsequent improvements in human players' performance. The comments touched on various topics such as the evolving strategies in chess due to computer analysis, the challenges faced by younger players in competitive events, the scoring systems in different sports, the potential changes to tournament formats, and even debated the idea of removing draws from chess games. Some users discussed the complexity of endgames in chess and the implications of different rule modifications. Additionally, there was a conversation about the popularity of Chess960 compared to traditional chess. The discussions also included recommendations for online platforms for playing Go and chess, and shared insights on ongoing tournaments.

### Direct Nash Optimization: Teaching language models to self-improve

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03715) | 50 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39972800)

The paper titled "Direct Nash Optimization: Teaching Language Models to Self-Improve with General Preferences" introduces an algorithm called DNO that leverages preference feedback to help large language models enhance themselves. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on reward maximization, DNO directly optimizes general preferences, resulting in improved model performance. In experiments, the Orca-2.5 model aligned by DNO outperformed GPT-4-Turbo and other models, showcasing a significant win-rate increase on AlpacaEval 2.0. This advancement in optimizing language models could lead to notable progress in the field of artificial intelligence.
