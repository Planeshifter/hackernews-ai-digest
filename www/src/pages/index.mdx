### Re-fixing Servo's event-loop

#### [Submission URL](https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/re-fixing-servos-event-loop-e00bdf267385) | 113 points | by [Ygg2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ygg2) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41245901)

In a recent deep dive into the challenges of refining Servo's event-loop, Gregory Terzian examines a newly identified concurrency issue that complicates the rendering order of web content. As part of Servo's ongoing improvements, the team faced unexpected problems when implementing a simple filtering method for managing document updates. 

When multiple documents vie for the same event-loop—such as tabs or iframes—ensuring the correct rendering order becomes crucial. Terzian highlights a flaw in the existing batching mechanism used to manage rendering updates, which could lead to rendering tasks being stuck in a deadlock when a page closes. This happens because if a task is queued for one document but the associated event-loop is canceled prematurely, a subsequent document might be prevented from executing its tasks.

The proposed fix? Instead of a global batching mechanism, the batching should be scoped to individual pages, enhancing reliability. However, uncovering this flaw required a shift in thinking from linear task processing to more robust logical invariants, leading Terzian to employ TLA+ for modeling behaviors.

Through analytical modeling and informal verification, Terzian's work demonstrates how stronger invariants can prevent errors and support more efficient task execution. This approach not only solves the immediate problem but also provides a framework for future development and error detection within Servo.

The discussion centers around the complexities of formal methods and type systems in programming languages, especially in the context of industry adoption and practical applications. 

1. **Industry Perspectives on Formal Methods**: Users express skepticism about the speed of the industry's embrace of formal proofs and type-driven development. There's a debate on the balance between practical usability in programming languages (like TypeScript and Rust) versus theoretical rigor. Some contributors highlight that while formal methods are beneficial, they are often overlooked or deemed complicated in real-world software engineering practices.

2. **Type Systems and Programming Languages**: There's an emphasis on the importance of more expressive type systems as they relate to error prevention and code maintainability. Discussions bring up Rust's type system in comparison to languages like OCaml, suggesting that languages need to evolve to better integrate formal specifications.

3. **Testing Practices**: The value of systematic testing, particularly property-based testing over standard unit tests, is discussed as a way to uncover issues in codebases more effectively.

4. **Verification Tools**: Several comments mention tools like TLA+ and Frama-C as promising avenues for achieving formal verification in software but also stress that they are not commonly integrated within mainstream development workflows. 

5. **Bridging Theory and Practice**: Overall, the dialogue reflects a wish for stronger connections between formal methods and practical software development, hinting at the challenges of implementing rigorous approaches in a fast-paced industry setting. Participants call for more acceptance and understanding of these methods for improving code reliability and robustness, even if it means a steeper learning curve.

### Self-driving Waymo cars keep SF residents awake all night by honking

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/08/self-driving-waymo-cars-keep-sf-residents-awake-all-night-by-honking-at-each-other/) | 94 points | by [yabones](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yabones) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41239096)

In a surreal twist of urban living, residents in San Francisco’s South of Market area are experiencing sleepless nights thanks to Waymo's self-driving cars. As if they’ve become the new town criers, these autonomous vehicles have taken to honking at each other in a local parking lot, prompting a cacophony that begins around 4 a.m. each night. 

Originally welcomed for their potential to enhance safety, the influx of Waymo cars has morphed into a nuisance as residents report escalating horn honking, particularly from vehicles navigating tight parking spots. Christopher Cherry, a resident, shared his disappointment over the cars' behavior, which has taken a turn from quirky innovation to disruptive annoyance. Efforts to address the noise are complicated by the absence of human operators in the vehicles, leaving residents to voice their concerns to Waymo’s corporate team. 

In response to the media coverage, a Waymo spokesperson acknowledged the honking and assured the community that they were working on a fix. Meanwhile, the situation has sparked reflections on the sometimes absurd intersection of technology and daily life, as noted by tech journalist James Vincent, who remarked on the irony of empty cars performing autonomously—serving tech ambitions rather than the needs of the local residents. If only their honks could signal a resolution!

The discussion surrounding the submission about Waymo’s self-driving cars in San Francisco largely revolves around the annoyance residents are experiencing due to excessive honking from these vehicles. Comments express various viewpoints on the situation, with some users humorously elevating the absurdity of autonomous vehicles honking at each other, while others raise serious concerns about the implications of their behavior.

Several commenters acknowledge the strange, almost dystopian nature of self-driving cars acting autonomously and creating noise disturbances, reflecting on the gap between technology and human needs. There's a consensus that the honking is a significant nuisance, and discussions speculate on potential solutions, such as improving the technology that controls the cars' reactions and honking behavior. 

Moreover, some users critique the expectations placed on autonomous vehicles, suggesting that the integration of technology into urban environments isn't being handled responsibly, as seen in the honking disrupting sleep. Suggestions also include legislative measures to address the behavior of self-driving cars in public spaces and the responsibility of companies like Waymo to rectify these issues. Overall, the conversation highlights a blend of humor, criticism, and concern regarding the real-world effects of advanced technology on everyday life.
