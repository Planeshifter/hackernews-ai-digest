In a fascinating blend of neuroscience and AI innovation, a new development known as the Continuous Thought Machine (CTM) aims to bridge the divide between the current state of AI and the incredible adaptability of biological brains. Developed by researchers from Sakana AI and universities in Tsukuba and Copenhagen, the CTM leverages the concept of neural synchronization—an essential feature in biological brains—to improve AI systems' flexibility and adaptability.

Most modern AI strategies prioritize computational efficiency by ignoring temporal dynamics, a choice that often limits their resemblance to the human mind's flexible nature. Unlike traditional neural networks that reduce neural computations to static values, the CTM focuses on the dynamic timing and synchronization of neurons, which are crucial for biological intelligence.

The researchers argue that temporal dynamics, such as spike-timing-dependent plasticity and neural oscillations, are vital components that modern AI lacks for achieving human-like cognition. The CTM introduces a decoupled internal dimension and neuron-level models to process a history of incoming signals, moving away from static activations like ReLU.

In an interactive demonstration, the CTM showcases its abilities in solving mazes by utilizing neural synchronization as its core mechanism. The maze-solving task illustrates how the CTM deploys neural dynamics to interact with its environment, offering a glimpse into how these advanced models could revolutionize AI by embracing the complexities of temporal processing found in nature.

By placing emphasis on neuron timing and synchronization, the CTM not only challenges current practices but also sparks a conversation about the future direction of AI development—one that may ultimately bring us closer to understanding and replicating human-like reasoning.

### Avoiding AI is hard – but our freedom to opt out must be protected

#### [Submission URL](https://theconversation.com/avoiding-ai-is-hard-but-our-freedom-to-opt-out-must-be-protected-255873) | 243 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [139 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43958382)

In an age where artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly dictates the narratives of our daily lives, a pressing question arises that's often overlooked: What happens when we can't opt out of AI's influence? This query is front and center in an enlightening article by James Jin Kang from RMIT University Vietnam, published on The Conversation.

AI now orchestrates everything from job applications to healthcare decisions, adding a layer of complexity that often bypasses human judgment. In a world where an algorithm can reject your resume before a human even sees it, or where medical treatments are automatically selected by a machine, our autonomy faces unprecedented challenges. For many, AI’s encroachment feels akin to a sci-fi reality, one that edges uncomfortably close with each algorithm-driven decision.

Avoiding AI is no simple task. It underpins crucial systems—healthcare, transportation, finance—and extends its reach to social media, government services, and even the news we consume. Decisions made by AI in our daily lives are not only difficult to challenge but can require legal battles to overturn. The possibility of living entirely free from AI seems as elusive as choosing to abstain from electricity or the internet.

As AI systems gain ground, they bring with them biases and inequities. Automated processes in hiring or credit scoring can inadvertently favor certain demographics over others, creating social barriers and widening the gap between those integrated into the AI-driven world and those who lag behind. The societal impact is profound: opting out of AI might soon translate to opting out of essential modern life itself.

Echoing the timeless lesson of Goethe's "The Sorcerer’s Apprentice," AI holds the allure of powerful capabilities yet poses risks when unchecked. The moral of the tale—to avoid unleashing uncontrollable forces—resonates as we confront AI’s growing role in shaping our futures. The core concern is not just about technical safety but about protecting our freedom—to choose, to opt out, to maintain autonomy in the digital era.

To safeguard the right to a life free from AI's pervasive grip, systemic changes are imperative. Current AI governance frameworks emphasize fairness and accountability, but they typically ignore the fundamental right to disengage from AI without incurring societal penalties. Governments and businesses must craft policies that respect individuals' freedoms, ensuring no one is left behind in the digital transition.

Furthermore, digital literacy should be prioritized so individuals can understand and challenge technologies affecting their lives. Transparency in AI decision-making is crucial; individuals must have avenues to peer into these systems and hold them accountable.

Ultimately, as AI weaves deeper into the fabric of societal infrastructure—analogous to essential utilities like electricity—we must deliberate urgently on how to integrate it in a way that preserves human choice. Our collective future hinges on answering this pivotal question: As AI saturates more spaces in our lives, what do we potentially stand to lose?

The Hacker News discussion on AI's pervasive influence highlights several key themes and debates:

### 1. **AI in Hiring and Bias Concerns**  
   - Users critiqued AI-driven resume screening tools, noting that while automated systems (e.g., LLMs) mimic human judgment, they risk perpetuating biases. Companies may adopt these tools to reduce liability, but proving discriminatory intent or harm remains challenging.  
   - A subthread contrasted large corporations (e.g., Apple) using such tools with smaller-scale implementations, like in Omaha, where screening might be less invasive.  

### 2. **Accountability and Legal Challenges**  
   - The EU’s GDPR was cited as a framework requiring human review of AI decisions, though skeptics argued that human reviewers (e.g., HR staff) might lack expertise to override flawed AI judgments (e.g., confusing Java with JavaScript).  
   - Users debated whether companies can evade responsibility by blaming AI systems. Some emphasized that humans designing or deploying AI must be held accountable, referencing a 1979 IBM manual stating, “A computer should never be held accountable—it’s a tool for human management.”  

### 3. **Technical Realities of AI Systems**  
   - A detailed subthread explored spam filters as an example of AI making “final decisions.” Users discussed whether emails are silently discarded or flagged, technical nuances of email server logging, and the line between automation and human oversight.  

### 4. **AI vs. Human Decision-Making**  
   - While some argued AI systems inherit human biases (e.g., in insurance or loan approvals), others countered that humans are equally flawed. One user noted, “AI doesn’t change accountability—companies are still liable for bad outcomes, AI or not.”  

### 5. **Accessibility and Equity**  
   - Concerns were raised about marginalized groups facing disproportionate harm from AI errors (e.g., loan denials). Critics highlighted the high cost of litigation, which often makes challenging AI decisions inaccessible to lower-income individuals.  

### 6. **Skepticism Toward Regulation**  
   - While some called for stricter AI governance, others doubted enforcement efficacy, citing corporate lobbying and under-resourced regulatory agencies.  

### Key Takeaway  
The discussion reflects tension between recognizing AI’s potential benefits and grappling with its risks. Participants emphasized that systemic accountability—not just technical fixes—is critical to ensuring AI serves society equitably. As one user starkly put it, “Opting out of AI might soon mean opting out of modern life itself.”

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/05/12/us_copyright_office_ai_copyright/) | 436 points | by [croes](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=croes) | [374 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43961247)

In a surprising turn of events, the head of the US Copyright Office, Shira Perlmutter, was reportedly fired a day after a draft report was published, suggesting that AI companies may be breaching copyright law. The report, part of an extensive investigation into the relationship between AI and copyright, stated that the use of copyrighted content by AI developers often exceeds the fair use doctrine. This conclusion could spell legal trouble for major tech companies, including Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft, all currently facing litigation over copyright issues. These companies have defended their actions, claiming adherence to fair use provisions, but the report argues otherwise, especially when AI models are used for commercial purposes in a way that competes with existing markets.

The timing of Perlmutter's dismissal has raised eyebrows, with some suggesting it was politically motivated to favor Elon Musk, who has been vocal about loosening intellectual property laws. Musk has recently been in the spotlight for supporting moves to eliminate IP protections and has ambitions to train AI models using vast data from his social media platform, X.

Other speculations point to a broader political agenda tied to a recent personnel change in the Library of Congress, which oversees the Copyright Office. This change was reportedly linked to disputes over diversity and the appropriateness of materials available in libraries for children—a policy direction heavily criticized by the Trump administration.

As the legal battles unfold, the tech industry and lawmakers are keenly watching how the copyright and AI crossroads will reshape future policies, potentially impacting not only how AI models are trained but also how copyright law is enforced in the digital age.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Geopolitical & Ethical Concerns**:  
   Users debated whether AI companies’ use of copyrighted material aligns with ethical and legal standards, contrasting Western corporate practices with China’s approach to IP enforcement. Some argued that large corporations (e.g., Meta, OpenAI) exploit loopholes or engage in practices akin to piracy, while others highlighted hypocrisy in criticizing China for IP violations when Western companies may do the same.

2. **Fair Use vs. Infringement**:  
   The discussion centered on whether AI training on copyrighted content exceeds "fair use," especially for commercial purposes. Critics compared AI companies’ practices to torrenting, citing Meta’s alleged use of modified torrent clients to download datasets. Others defended AI models as transformative, akin to human learning, but acknowledged potential legal risks.

3. **Meta’s Controversial Data Practices**:  
   Specific allegations surfaced about Meta (Facebook) using torrent-like methods to download video datasets while evading detection, including internal messaging about concealing activity. Users questioned the legality and corporate accountability, drawing parallels to traditional piracy but noting the difficulty of prosecuting large entities.

4. **Impact on Creators & Markets**:  
   Concerns were raised about musicians and creators being undervalued in the streaming economy, with some advocating for direct support via platforms like Bandcamp or Patreon. Others worried AI-generated content could further erode creative markets by replicating copyrighted works.

5. **National Security & Access**:  
   A user argued that AI should have unrestricted access to technical and academic publications (for national security) but stricter limits on creative works to prevent plagiarism. This sparked debate over how to balance innovation with IP rights, including proposals for licensed training data.

6. **Government Regulation & Corporate Influence**:  
   Skepticism emerged about governments’ ability to regulate AI effectively, with some pointing to antitrust issues and corporate lobbying (e.g., Microsoft’s support for OpenAI). Others criticized the political timing of the Copyright Office head’s dismissal, linking it to broader agendas around weakening IP protections.

**Key Takeaways**:  
The discussion reflects tension between innovation and copyright compliance, skepticism of corporate ethics, and concerns about geopolitical double standards. While some defend AI’s transformative potential, others emphasize legal risks and the need for clearer regulation. The firing of the Copyright Office head was viewed through a political lens, with speculation about favoring tech interests over creator rights.

### Title of work deciphered in sealed Herculaneum scroll via digital unwrapping

#### [Submission URL](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/title-work-deciphered-sealed-herculaneum-scroll-digital-unwrapping) | 231 points | by [namanyayg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=namanyayg) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43953883)

In an extraordinary revelation, researchers have harnessed the power of digital unwrapping to finally uncover the title and author of a scroll that had been sealed since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The scroll, known as PHerc. 172 from Herculaneum, was identified using advanced imaging techniques as "On Vices" by the Greek philosopher Philodemus. This significant discovery, part of the ongoing Vesuvius Challenge, not only brings new insight into ancient philosophical teachings but also earned the researchers a much-coveted prize of $60,000.

The scroll was painstakingly scanned in July 2024 and the data subsequently released for public analysis, inviting global participation. The title was independently deciphered by Sean Johnson from the Vesuvius Challenge and a research duo from the University of Würzburg, marking a significant milestone in the study of ancient texts. Philodemus, an Epicurean philosopher known for advocating the pursuit of pleasure as a path to a virtuous life, has been a central figure in the vast collection of works found at the Villa of Papyri at Herculaneum.

While the revelation of the work's title is a triumph, questions remain about its exact placement within Philodemus’ larger "On Vices" series, speculated to be at least 10 books long. These achievements highlight the transformative potential of integrating artificial intelligence into humanities research, breathing new life into ancient artifacts and offering fresh perspectives on historical scholarship.

The Vesuvius Challenge, initiated in 2023, continues to push the boundaries of knowledge by encouraging researchers worldwide to delve into the secrets of these ancient scrolls without causing physical harm, embodying a remarkable confluence of technology and history.

The discussion revolves around the appropriateness of labeling the ancient Herculaneum library as "pagan," given its Greco-Roman philosophical texts. Key points of debate include:  

1. **Terminology Concerns**: Critics argue "pagan" is an anachronistic Christian-centric term that imposes later religious frameworks onto a pre-Christian context. Supporters counter that it’s a widely accepted descriptor for Rome’s polytheistic traditions, distinguishing it from Abrahamic faiths.  

2. **Historical Context**: Some emphasize that the library, containing Epicurean works like Philodemus’, reflects a pre-Christian Roman intellectual tradition. Opponents stress that "pagan" risks distorting the era’s worldview, as Christianity hadn’t yet dominated Roman society (in 79 AD).  

3. **Modern Bias**: Users debate whether labeling it "pagan" inadvertently centers a Christian perspective, akin to calling non-Jewish texts "Goy." Comparisons are drawn to modern terminology, like avoiding "pagan" for Indian or Greek studies, to prevent cultural misrepresentation.  

4. **Scholarly Nuance**: Participants note that while "pagan" simplifies categorization, it may strip historical specificity. Alternatives like "non-Christian" or referencing specific philosophies (e.g., Epicurean) are suggested for accuracy.  

The discussion concludes with no resolution but highlights tensions between linguistic convenience and historical fidelity, underscoring the challenge of describing ancient contexts through modern lenses.

### LSP client in Clojure in 200 lines of code

#### [Submission URL](https://vlaaad.github.io/lsp-client-in-200-lines-of-code) | 157 points | by [vlaaad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vlaaad) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43955397)

In a fascinating exploration of coding efficiency, a Clojure enthusiast has created a minimal Language Server Protocol (LSP) client in just 200 lines of code. While initially attempting to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with LSP for smarter code navigation and inquiries, the coder unexpectedly pivoted towards crafting this lean client. This project underscores the power of LSP, which simplifies the integration process between code editors and language-specific tools by leveraging a standardized communication protocol, much like HTTP but for programming languages.

The focus of the project is not broad appeal—indeed, it's humorously noted that the audience might just be the three Clojure developers who write code editors—but rather educational. The challenge taken up was to develop a command-line linter using an LSP server without getting bogged down by the complexity of a full-fledged text editor.

The prototype excludes components like a JSON parser and document syncing, keeping things streamlined. Instead, it establishes a foundational communication layer between client and server using Java 24 with virtual threads, optimizing performance. The setup employs JSON-RPC, a protocol for remote procedure calls, layered over the base communication, to handle requests and responses efficiently.

By translating the client and server communication from byte streams into manageable JSON blobs, the project illustrates a clever application of programming concepts—demonstrating not just technical prowess, but the joy of solving 'MxN problems' with an 'M+N' approach. This clever synthesis from the Clojure community offers both a learning opportunity for developers and a testament to the art of coding small yet effective solutions.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the minimal Clojure LSP client highlights several key themes and debates:

1. **Clojure’s Strengths and Criticisms**:  
   - Supporters praise Clojure’s conciseness, expressiveness, and Java interop, arguing that its syntax allows for elegant solutions (e.g., the 200-line LSP client). Critics counter that Clojure’s reliance on Java and perceived complexity (e.g., `core.async`) can deter newcomers.  
   - Some users note that Clojure’s functional style and immutable data structures make code readable and maintainable, while others find its abstraction level challenging.  

2. **Java Boilerplate and Dependencies**:  
   - Comparisons to Java emphasize Clojure’s brevity—200 lines in Clojure vs. verbose Java boilerplate. However, subthreads acknowledge hidden complexities, such as dependency management (e.g., JSON libraries) and startup times for LSP servers.  
   - Technical debates arise over Clojure’s use of JAR files, native executables, and trade-offs in performance vs. simplicity.

3. **Clojure’s Niche and Community**:

In a surprising shift, Klarna, the buy now, pay later giant, is reintroducing human elements into its customer service strategy, just a year after its bold assertion that AI could replace the roles of 700 human representatives. At the time, Klarna had leaned heavily into automation, cutting costs and boasting impressive AI stats, such as reducing average resolution times to under two minutes. However, growing customer frustrations and a desire for more empathetic interactions have now prompted a rethink.

Klarna's spokesperson, Clare Nordstrom, emphasizes how AI will continue to provide speed and efficiency but highlights the irreplaceable value of human empathy and expertise. "AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy," she states, underscoring a balanced approach to customer service that clearly integrates both human and machine efforts.

CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledges past missteps, recognizing that prioritizing cost savings inadvertently compromised service quality. The new strategy will feature a flexible "Uber-type setup" for customer support, focusing on attracting talented professionals who can deliver exceptional service experiences.

This pivot comes amid industry-wide realizations that customer satisfaction is deeply rooted in human connection. Studies reinforce this, with a significant portion of customers expressing frustrations over impersonal chatbot interactions and a clear need for access to human support for more complex or sensitive issues. Klarna's revised approach suggests that a hybrid model, leveraging both human and AI strengths, could be the key to future-proofing customer service.

The Hacker News discussion on Klarna's reversal to incorporating human customer service, despite earlier AI-driven cuts, highlights several critical themes:

1. **Skepticism About Motives**: Users speculate that Klarna’s pivot is a strategic move to polish its image ahead of a potential IPO, framing itself as an “AI company” to attract higher valuations, rather than a genuine prioritization of customer experience.

Critics argue BNPL services target vulnerable demographics, enabling debt accumulation for non-essential purchases, despite Klarna’s claims of affordability.

3. **AI’s Role vs. Human Empathy**: While AI efficiently handles routine tasks (e.g., resolving missing food orders), users acknowledge its limitations in complex or sensitive scenarios. Many support a hybrid model but caution that human agents risk becoming a cost-cutting “Uber-style gig workforce” rather than a meaningful improvement.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**: In markets like the Netherlands, regulators are scrutinizing BNPL providers for predatory practices. Critics highlight Klarna’s fees (e.g., 4% per transaction vs. traditional methods) and the social impact of normalizing debt, especially among younger users.

5. **Technical Execution Challenges**: Klarna’s AI tools are criticized for clunky workflows and poor integration, suggesting the hybrid shift stems from technical shortcomings, not just empathy-driven strategy.

6. **BNPL’s Impact on Consumer Behavior**: Proponents argue BNPL boosts sales by making purchases psychologically affordable (e.g., splitting payments), while detractors warn it reduces long-term customer spending and perpetuates debt cycles, akin to credit cards but with less transparency.

7. **Industry Comparisons**: Users contrast Klarna with platforms like Uber and DoorDash, noting differences in core models (consumer finance vs. service logistics) but parallels in gig-economy labor structures.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects broad skepticism about Klarna’s intentions and the BNPL sector’s ethics, with cautious optimism for hybrid customer service models. However, concerns persist about regulatory risks, debt exploitation, and whether human integration addresses systemic issues or merely serves as PR.

### Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning with Zero Data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) | 82 points | by [leodriesch](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leodriesch) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43951985)

In a fascinating leap forward for AI, researchers have introduced "Absolute Zero," a revolutionary approach that pushes the boundaries of machine learning by omitting external training data entirely. This innovative paradigm, proposed by Andrew Zhao and team, spotlights the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system designed to independently generate and solve its own tasks to enhance reasoning—without relying on pre-existing datasets.

The novelty here is its reliance on reinforced self-play with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a mechanism that traditionally benefits from human-supplied question-and-answer sets to train models. Absolute Zero, however, sidesteps this requirement, creating a model that evolves by crafting challenges suited to its learning goals, embracing a future where AI may need to autonomously learn beyond human-provided data.

Notably, AZR not only stands out by thriving on zero external data but also delivers state-of-the-art results in complex coding and math tasks, surpassing those models trained on vast human-curated collections. This breakthrough showcases potential scalability and adaptability across different model scales and architectures, forging a path towards more independent and open-ended AI learning systems. This development invites speculation on the implications of autonomous AI learning as systems grow beyond human-level intelligence.

One user points out that *self-play* (a cornerstone of the method) feels obvious in hindsight, comparing it to techniques like AlphaZero. Others note that the paper underemphasizes practical implementation challenges, such as scaling or refining self-generated tasks beyond simple domains.

3. **Comparison to Big Labs**: Commenters liken the work to research from OpenAI or DeepMind, with debates about whether such labs would have published similar findings. Some argue that while the concept might seem basic, perfecting the training pipeline (e.g., reward mechanisms, efficient verification) is where true innovation lies.

4. **Model Reliability Concerns**: Skeptics warn that self-generated tasks could lead to "blind" models prone to reinforcing errors or unstable reasoning chains. One user cites GPT’s occasional struggles with nonsensical self-corrections, speculating that human oversight or structured checkpoints might still be necessary to ensure reliability.

5. **Debating "True Reasoning"**: A central thread questions whether AZR demonstrates genuine reasoning or clever pattern mimicry. Critics argue that true reasoning requires grounding in real-world knowledge, while supporters counter that self-play with domain-specific verification (e.g., Python interpreters validating code) might suffice for limited tasks.

6. **Publishing Practices**: A meta-debate arises about incentives in AI research, with one user criticizing the tendency to prioritize positive results over negative ones. Others note that the paper itself includes strong positive benchmarks, though technical details (e.g., dataset scaling, computational costs) are underexplored.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about the paradigm’s potential but emphasizes unresolved challenges—scalability, generalization beyond narrow domains, and the murky line between learned heuristics and "true" reasoning.

In a thought-provoking article on Hacker News, the author discusses the ongoing struggle against rogue bots - especially large language model (LLM) scrapers - which are increasingly impacting the web. These bots not only siphon off human creativity to create average content but also stress hosting infrastructures with DDoS-like traffic patterns. The article highlights a range of countermeasures webmasters are using, such as CAPTCHAs, JavaScript proof-of-work, and serving nonsense data, but criticizes their broad reliance on JavaScript, which can degrade the browsing experience.

The problem with these technical defenses, the author argues, is they are short-sighted and inadvertently damage the user experience. Websites become unusable without JavaScript, hindering those who prefer cleaner and more private browsing experiences. Copyright law is brought into the conversation as a potential instrument for tackling the issue more effectively, posing a question on whether legal implications could offer a longer-term solution to protect against mechanized piracy.

While concedes that there's no easy answer to the bot problem, the author advocates for user autonomy, suggesting readers simply skip sites that enforce restrictive practices. It’s a call for web developers to consider the usability impact of anti-bot measures and for LLM companies to face accountability within the bounds of copyright laws.

These methods were also deemed detrimental to user experience, particularly for privacy-focused users who disable JavaScript.  

2. **False Positives and User Hassle**: Anti-bot tools like traffic-light verification systems were noted for frustrating legitimate users, with one comment claiming *40% of human users are misidentified as bots*. This underscores the trade-off between security and accessibility.  

3. **Resource Strain and Costs**: Even with optimized infrastructure (e.g., CDNs, caching), bots generate significant resource costs. A detailed reply highlighted that spikes in bot traffic can strain budgets, especially for smaller sites, and dismissed purely technical solutions as insufficient against DDoS-like attacks.  

4. **Terminology and Control**: One user emphasized the need to differentiate between terms like "GPT" and broader "LLMs," arguing that OpenAI’s dominance in language model branding could shift perceptions of responsibility.  

5. **Legal and Copyright Considerations**: Comparing digital content to physical books, some debated whether copyright law could deter scraping. However, others countered that restrictive paywalls (e.g., academic papers) create barriers to knowledge access, raising ethical questions. Opposing views emerged on balancing creators’ rights with open information flow.  

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism toward purely technical fixes and highlights the complexity of balancing usability, cost, legal frameworks, and ethical access in tackling bot-related challenges.
