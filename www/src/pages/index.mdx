### Seven Dyson Sphere Candidates

#### [Submission URL](https://www.centauri-dreams.org/2024/05/18/seven-dyson-sphere-candidates/) | 173 points | by [sohkamyung](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sohkamyung) | [298 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40397823)

The latest buzz on Hacker News is all about Dyson sphere candidates! Astronomers are abuzz with excitement over seven potential candidates for Dyson spheres, megastructures that could one day enclose stars to harness their energy. The discussion revolves around Project Hephaistos' latest paper in 2024, where researchers analyze infrared signatures of these candidates, hinting at possible extraterrestrial civilizations advanced enough to build such structures.

The paper delves into the complexities of photometry in detecting Dyson spheres, as it involves measuring light across different wavelengths to infer properties like distance, temperature, and composition. Modeling the effects of a Dyson sphere on a star's photometry requires accounting for both obscuration of the star and re-emission of absorbed radiation at longer wavelengths due to the megastructure's heat.

The team behind Project Hephaistos leveraged data from Gaia, 2MASS, and WISE to identify stars potentially hosting Dyson spheres, focusing on partial spheres that partially obscure the star's light. By scrutinizing mid-infrared signatures for excess heat, they sifted through millions of models to pinpoint seven candidates that seem to be genuine infrared sources free of contamination.

While the researchers are cautious to label these sources as Dyson spheres, the tantalizing possibility of alien megastructures lurking among the stars sparks curiosity and contemplation within the scientific community. Stay tuned as astronomers continue to unravel the mysteries of these enigmatic candidates and push the boundaries of our understanding of the cosmos.

### Bye Bye, AI: How to block Google's AI overviews and just get search results

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/google-chrome/bye-bye-ai-how-to-block-googles-annoying-ai-overviews-and-just-get-search-results) | 53 points | by [adamcarson](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamcarson) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40382687)

Google's "AI Overviews" feature, known as SGE (Search Generative Experience), has stirred up controversy for its unreliable and often misleading AI summaries that dominate search results. Users have reported instances where the AI's advice, such as suggesting urine consumption for kidney stones, has overshadowed credible sources. The absence of an option to disable this function in Google settings has left users frustrated. However, there are workarounds to bypass these AI-generated summaries and access the traditional list of web pages.

For Chrome users, a simple tweak allows all searches to be directed to Google's web search tab. By adding a custom search engine with the parameter ?udm=14, queries from the address bar will skip the AI-overview-laden results. Additionally, a Chrome extension aptly named Hide Google AI Overviews hides these summaries on the search results page.

On mobile devices like Android or iOS, where Chrome lacks the flexibility of desktop browsers, Firefox offers a solution. By setting up a custom search engine in Firefox with the same parameter, users can search directly from the web tab, avoiding the AI summaries altogether.

While Google's attempt to enhance search results with AI may have missed the mark, users can take steps to ensure they receive accurate and reliable information without the interference of AI-generated content.

The discussion surrounding the submission highlights various perspectives on the impact of Google's AI summaries on search results and its implications for developers:

1. Some users express frustration over the poor quality of Google search results and the difficulty in disabling the AI summaries on mobile devices.
2. Suggestions are offered for bypassing the AI-generated summaries by using specific search parameters in browsers like Chrome and Firefox.
3. A debate ensues on whether AI poses a threat to developers, with arguments about the evolving nature of technology and the role of developers in adapting to these changes.
4. The conversation also touches on concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated content and the potential implications for the development community.
