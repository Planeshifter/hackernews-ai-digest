### What happens when you trigger a car's automated emergency stopping?

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/what-happens-when-you-trigger-a-cars-automated-emergency-stopping/) | 49 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39068186)

According to a study by the Automobile Association of America's Foundation for Traffic Safety, 16-21% of all fatal vehicle crashes reported to the police in the US involve drowsy driving. This means that between 6,080 and 7,980 road deaths are linked to drowsy drivers, surpassing the number of deaths caused by drunk driving. Automakers have been implementing drowsiness detection systems in vehicles for years, but advancements in semi-autonomous capabilities are now allowing cars to take control of the vehicle if the driver becomes inattentive or incapacitated. The systems can detect if the driver is no longer driving and trigger visual, audible, and physical prompts to wake them up. However, there is still room for improvement as these emergency stop capabilities are not foolproof.

Discussion:
- Kirby64 points out that while it's interesting that the discussion about emergency braking systems in standard cars happens to stop paying attention to autonomous cars, Mercedes calling a call center can be aggressive and does not send a journalist calling. Many users agree that the aggressive behavior of the call center is not ideal.
- pnkglm adds that for a person reacting to a sequence described as a medical emergency, it's good to check if there was a collision, as reporting a collision can save a life.
- m3047 mentions that they would prefer to be involved in a less life-threatening incident and questions the compliance of the person answering the emergency call.
- pnkglm agrees that implementing the call is an important thing to check as the emergency services should be able to respond quickly.
- dst-pch points out that people should start being shocked by reduced cognitive abilities and it makes sense to ask serious yet simple questions to determine what happened.
- RockRobotRock mentions that negligence is a relevant topic and automatic emergency braking systems are important in highway settings.
- smj notes that the headline cuts off and the article could be about emergency stopping sounds.
- dnldhntr finds it interesting how the behavior of the involving collision station is available and thinks it's important to know how people react to a collision station.
- marcellus23 suggests that automated emergency braking might mean the system breaks more thanks to your hot thoughts about the year, and that cars with cruise control and hands-off- wheel behavior are braking more in any case.

The Tokyo metropolitan government is launching an AI-driven dating app called Tokyo Futari Story, aimed at helping single residents find their life partners. The app has a stringent registration process that includes verifying users' salaries and single status, and pairs them up based on shared values using AI technology. The need for such a service is evident, as a large percentage of men and women in Tokyo have never been married. However, critics argue that the app is not a solution to the underlying reasons why people are not getting married and having children, such as financial constraints. They suggest that the government should address these fundamental issues instead of funding a dating app. While some welcome the initiative, others believe it is unnecessary, as there are already many dating sites available. The app is set to go live in the spring.

The discussion on this submission revolves around several key points. 
1. The high cost of housing in Tokyo and its impact on the affordability of living, particularly for young professionals and families. The exorbitant rental prices and the lack of affordable housing options are seen as major hurdles to getting married and having children. The cost of living in Tokyo is compared to other cities, such as Sydney, to highlight the discrepancy.
2. The cultural and societal factors influencing the decline in marriage and birth rates. Some comments suggest that financial constraints are not the sole reasons for people delaying or avoiding marriage. The preference for remaining single, concerns about financial stability, and the pressure to provide documentation that verifies annual income are cited as factors contributing to the decline in marriages and births.
3. The lack of social security and support for raising children is seen as a significant issue, further discouraging people from starting families. The absence of reliable birth control methods in the past and the prevalence of child labor in older generations are also mentioned as reasons for the lower birth rate.
4. The discussion touches on the need to address the underlying socio-economic problems and provide better work-life balance instead of funding dating apps. Some argue that the government should focus on making housing more affordable and improving social security for families, rather than attempting to solve the issue through dating apps.

Overall, the comments reflect a nuanced understanding of the complex factors contributing to the decline in marriage and birth rates in Tokyo, including societal expectations, financial constraints, and the lack of support for raising families. There is a general consensus that addressing these underlying issues is crucial in finding a solution.
