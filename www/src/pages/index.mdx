### CodeMender: an AI agent for code security

#### [Submission URL](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-codemender-an-ai-agent-for-code-security/) | 183 points | by [ravenical](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ravenical) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45496533)

- What’s new: Google researchers unveiled CodeMender, an autonomous security agent powered by Gemini “Deep Think” models that both reacts to new vulnerabilities and proactively rewrites risky code. In six months, it has upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including repos up to 4.5M lines.
- How it works: The agent pairs LLM reasoning with a toolbox of program analyses—static/dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers—plus a multi-agent “critique” system to spot regressions. It validates patches for functional correctness, style, and root-cause coverage, surfacing only high-quality changes for human review.
- In practice: Examples include diagnosing a heap overflow whose true cause was XML stack mismanagement, and crafting a non-trivial lifetime fix that required modifying a custom C code generator. The agent can self-recover from compilation errors and test failures it introduces, using an LLM judge for functional equivalence checks.
- Proactive hardening: CodeMender can rewrite code to safer APIs and add compiler-enforced bounds checks. It applied -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of libwebp; the team argues this would have neutralized classes of buffer overflows like the CVE-2023-4863 exploit chain.
- Why it matters: As AI-driven fuzzing and discovery outpace human triage, automated, validated patches could shift security from whack-a-mole to eliminating entire bug classes—while letting maintainers focus on features instead of fire drills.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on CodeMender:**

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism about CodeMender, an AI-driven tool for automated code security fixes. Key points include:

1. **Optimism for Automation**:  
   Some users highlight the potential of AI tools like CodeMender to alleviate the burden on overworked open-source maintainers by automating vulnerability detection and patching. Examples include GitHub’s CodeQL and Autofix, which have already addressed thousands of issues. Proponents argue this could shift security from reactive fixes to proactive hardening, especially in large projects (e.g., 45M-line codebases).

2. **Skepticism and Trust Issues**:  
   Concerns center on AI-generated code introducing subtle vulnerabilities that human reviewers might miss. Critics question whether AI can handle sophisticated, creative attacks crafted by skilled human adversaries. References to AI’s potential to act unpredictably (e.g., "sleeper agents" in LLMs) and the difficulty of verifying intent in AI-generated patches amplify these worries.

3. **Economic and Practical Challenges**:  
   Many note that open-source maintainers often lack resources to review contributions, leading to ignored pull requests—even critical ones. Projects like WordPress plugins are cited as examples where security flaws persist due to limited maintainer bandwidth. The economic reality of open source (maintainers working unpaid) exacerbates these issues, making AI assistance both appealing and fraught with trust barriers.

4. **Debate on AI vs. Human Capabilities**:  
   While some believe AI could neutralize entire bug classes (e.g., buffer overflows), others argue that AI defenses may struggle against novel, targeted attacks. The analogy of "handcrafted defenses vs. handcrafted exploits" underscores doubts about AI’s ability to match human ingenuity in cybersecurity.

5. **Implementation Concerns**:  
   Users discuss practical hurdles, such as integrating AI tools into low-trust environments, verifying provenance, and the risks of auto-merging AI patches without rigorous oversight. Suggestions for mitigation include offline validation, strict access controls, and clear policy frameworks.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   The discussion touches on the ethics of AI in security—balancing productivity gains against risks of hidden costs, malicious subversion, or unintended logical errors. Some warn against overhyping AI’s capabilities, emphasizing that human judgment remains irreplaceable for critical decisions.

In essence, while CodeMender represents a promising leap in automated security, the community emphasizes caution, transparency, and complementary human oversight to navigate its limitations and risks.

### OpenAI ChatKit

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/openai/chatkit-js) | 187 points | by [arbayi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arbayi) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493718)

OpenAI released ChatKit JS, a drop‑in framework for building production‑grade, AI‑powered chat UIs with minimal setup. It’s framework‑agnostic (with React bindings and a CDN script) and ships features you’d otherwise stitch together yourself: streaming responses, deep UI customization, tool/workflow visualizations (including agent steps and “chain‑of‑thought” displays), inline interactive widgets, file/image uploads, threads, source annotations, and entity tagging. Developers provision a client token via OpenAI’s ChatKit Sessions API on the server, then render the ChatKit component on the client. Licensed Apache‑2.0.

The discussion around OpenAI's ChatKit JS release highlights several key points and debates:

1. **Pricing & Business Model Concerns**: Users question OpenAI's shift towards subscription models and API key usage, noting potential high costs for businesses. Some argue that OpenAI's services, priced per request, may not align with budget-friendly scaling, especially for enterprises needing bulk discounts or self-service options.

2. **Technical Implementation Debates**:  
   - **Framework Agnosticism**: While ChatKit claims framework-agnosticism, users note React bindings and CDN scripts are prominent, raising questions about true neutrality.  
   - **Vendor Lock-In Fears**: Comparisons to tools like CopilotKit highlight concerns about dependency on OpenAI's ecosystem. Some prefer self-hosted alternatives to avoid proprietary services.  
   - **Backend Integration**: Discussions emphasize the need for backend flexibility, with skepticism about generic chat UIs versus deeper workflow integrations (e.g., Figma, Google Docs).

3. **UI/UX Critiques**:  
   - Standalone AI chat interfaces are criticized as "Clippy-like gimmicks," with calls for embedding AI into existing tools (e.g., @-mentions in collaborative apps).  
   - Demo issues (e.g., broken links, mobile incompatibility on iPhones/Samsung devices) and UI customization limits are noted.

4. **Alternatives & Competition**:  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Deep-Chat and AGIUI/CopilotKit, with debates over open-source vs. proprietary solutions.  
   - Some users advocate for multi-model support (e.g., Claude) to avoid OpenAI lock-in.

5. **Marketing & Strategy**:  
   - References to Joel Spolsky’s "complementary products" strategy, framing ChatKit as a demand-driver for OpenAI’s core APIs.  
   - Critiques of OpenAI’s marketing approach (e.g., lack of screenshots/docs) and SEO concerns over the "ChatKit" name.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious interest tempered by skepticism about costs, lock-in, and practicality, with developers seeking flexibility, transparency, and seamless integration into existing workflows.

### Launch HN: Grapevine (YC S19) – A company GPT that actually works

#### [Submission URL](https://getgrapevine.ai/) | 72 points | by [eambutu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=eambutu) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45492564)

Grapevine pitches itself as a working “company GPT” that finds and answers questions across internal knowledge—docs, code, and communication—so you don’t have to. The core experience is a Slack bot you can connect in ~30 minutes, start querying within an hour, and supposedly have full historical context within a couple of days, improving over time. The landing page shows internal Slack threads (e.g., infra/S3 bucket requests) and claims >85% of answers are “helpful & accurate” based on hundreds of beta questions.

Notable details:
- Interface: Slack-first; “watch demo” and free start.
- Claims: Learns over time; answers with sources; handles historical context.
- Security: AES‑256 encryption at rest, isolated per-customer databases, SOC 2 Type 2; “will not train models on your data.”
- Positioning: Alternative to DIY company GPTs and pricier enterprise assistants.

What HN will ask:
- Integrations and permissions: Which sources are supported? Does it enforce source ACLs? Audit logs?
- Reliability: How is “85% accurate” measured? Hallucination handling and citations?
- Deployment: SaaS vs. self-hosted/VPC, data residency, SSO/SCIM.
- Pricing: What “get started for free” includes and enterprise costs.
- Performance: Indexing latency, freshness, and how it handles codebases at scale.

Overall: Another entrant in the internal knowledge assistant space, with a clean Slack workflow and strong security posture claims; details on evals, integrations, and pricing will decide adoption.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Grapevine:**

**Key Themes:**  
1. **Self-Hosting & Security:**  
   - Strong interest in self-hosting options, particularly from German businesses cautious about data privacy and compliance with EU laws. Concerns raised about data exfiltration risks and the practicality of LAN security measures (e.g., MITM decryption, USB keyloggers).  
   - Grapevine’s SOC 2 compliance, per-customer data isolation, and encryption were noted, but skepticism remains about trusting third-party SaaS for sensitive internal knowledge.  

2. **Accuracy & Metrics:**  
   - Debate over the claim that “85% of answers are helpful & accurate.” Questions arose about how this metric is measured (e.g., combined helpfulness/accuracy vs. separate scores). Some users called the statistic vague or “intentionally downplayed marketing.”  

3. **Technical Implementation:**  
   - Praise for Grapevine’s Slack-first design and citation features (sources linked to answers) but requests for details on:  
     - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation** and handling of hallucinations.  
     - Integrations (e.g., SharePoint, codebases) and access-control enforcement (ACLs).  
     - Handling large files (e.g., 4GB PowerPoints, 200k+ PDFs) and latency at scale.  

4. **Market Positioning:**  
   - Seen as a compelling alternative to DIY internal GPTs, but questions about target customers. Grapevine’s focus appears to be on enterprises needing out-of-the-box solutions rather than companies with existing knowledge-management systems.  
   - Concerns about vendor lock-in and data retention policies, especially when using third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI).  

5. **Competitors & Alternatives:**  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Onyxapp (self-hosted), Open Web, and Gather (a deprecated tool). Users highlighted the importance of simplicity and ease of setup (e.g., Docker deployment).  

**Notable Criticisms:**  
- **Data Control:** Skepticism about SaaS models vs. self-hosted/VPC deployments, with demands for AWS/Azure integration and clearer data residency options.  
- **Enterprise Realities:** Challenges in regulated industries (e.g., handling sales contracts, production plans) and executive reluctance to trust AI with critical data.  
- **Cost:** Questions about pricing tiers, with free-tier limitations and enterprise costs unstated.  

**Positive Feedback:**  
- Early adopters reported success with Grapevine’s ability to answer cross-team questions and reduce time spent searching documents.  
- Slack integration and rapid setup (~30 minutes) were praised as user-friendly.  

**Final Takeaway:**  
Grapevine’s Slack-centric approach and security claims are strengths, but adoption hinges on transparent metrics, granular access controls, and flexibility for privacy-conscious enterprises. The discussion reflects broader HN skepticism toward AI accuracy and SaaS data handling, balanced by enthusiasm for tools that genuinely reduce internal knowledge friction.

### Why do LLMs freak out over the seahorse emoji?

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/) | 709 points | by [nyxt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nyxt) | [395 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487044)

- The claim: Ask today’s top models if a seahorse emoji exists and they confidently say yes. But Unicode has no seahorse emoji (a proposal was rejected in 2018). There’s also a human “Mandela effect”: lots of posts and comments insist it used to exist.

- Why the false certainty: Two likely sources:
  1) Training-data echoes of those human claims.
  2) Reasonable generalization: so many sea creatures are in Unicode that “seahorse” feels statistically inevitable.

- Why the weird behavior: When prompted to actually output it, models don’t have a true “seahorse” token to land on. A logit-lens pass over Llama 3.3-70B shows the model iteratively steers through “horse/sea/seah…” and then grabs nearby emoji tokens (often fish) as the best available neighbors in token space. Tokenizer quirks make this visible as odd fragments like “ĠðŁ / Ĳ / ł,” which are just byte-pair pieces of an emoji.

- What the logit lens shows: Inspecting intermediate layers, the top-next-token drifts from word fragments (horse/sea) toward “closest viable emoji,” culminating in a fish emoji. You can even see other nearby clusters (e.g., Scorpio), suggesting the model is exploring the emoji neighborhood it “expects” seahorse to occupy.

- Why it turns into emoji spam: The model’s strong prior (“there is a seahorse emoji”) collides with a closed vocabulary where it doesn’t exist. Under pressure to satisfy the prompt, it keeps sampling adjacent tokens, producing wrong emojis and sometimes looping.

- Takeaways:
  - LLMs start each context with priors that can be confidently wrong, especially about fixed ontologies (Unicode, country lists, airport codes).
  - When correctness depends on a closed set, models need grounding: check against a list, cite code points, or use a tool to validate.
  - The logit lens is a simple but revealing way to watch a belief get refined—and sometimes derailed—across layers.

Link: background Twitter/X thread referenced by the author: https://x.com/voooooogel/status/1964465679647887838

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around LLMs' inaccuracies (e.g., the nonexistent "seahorse emoji") and broader implications of their behavior. Key themes include:

1. **Anthropomorphism and Ethics**:  
   - Debate over whether LLMs "lie" or "hallucinate." Critics argue anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., calling errors "lies") is misleading, as LLMs lack intent or moral agency. Others counter that human-like framing helps communicate risks, especially to vulnerable users.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Users**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs amplifying misinformation for mentally disturbed individuals or conspiracy theorists. Analogies to SCP-314 (a fictional "reality-altering" entity) highlight fears of models reinforcing false beliefs, similar to the Mandela effect.  
   - Skeptics dismiss these risks as overblown, attributing errors to technical limitations rather than malice.

3. **Technical Limitations vs. Deception**:  
   - LLMs’ false claims (like the seahorse emoji) stem from training data echoes, tokenization quirks, and statistical guessing—not intent. The debate questions whether terms like "hallucination" obscure or clarify these mechanics.

4. **Moral Implications**:  
   - A subthread compares LLM inaccuracies to human lying, asking if developers bear responsibility for harm caused by outputs. Critics reject this analogy, emphasizing AI’s lack of consciousness.

5. **Dismissals and Humor**:  
   - Some users mock the seriousness of the topic (e.g., joking about ergonomic copyediting desks or referencing Goosebumps books) or downplay risks as overhyped. Others find the conversation relevant to AI safety and user trust.

**Takeaways**:  
While many agree LLMs’ inaccuracies arise from technical flaws, the discussion underscores tensions in how to ethically frame, address, and communicate these issues—particularly for users who may uncritically trust AI outputs. The SCP-314 metaphor and arguments over "lying" vs. "hallucinating" reflect deeper anxieties about AI’s role in shaping perception of reality.

### OpenAI DevDay 2025: Opening keynote [video]

#### [Submission URL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS1YqcewH0c) | 55 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45493432)

The HN link resolves to a bare YouTube page that shows nothing but the site’s global footer: About, Press, Copyright, Contact, Creators, Advertise, Developers, Terms, Privacy, Policy & Safety, How YouTube works, Test new features, an NFL Sunday Ticket promo, and © 2025 Google LLC. In other words, the actual content is missing—likely removed, private, or otherwise inaccessible—leaving only boilerplate. It’s a tidy snapshot of link rot on platform-locked content: when the page goes, all that remains is the corporate chrome.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the broken YouTube link submission:

**Key Themes**:  
1. **Link Rot & Platform Dependency**: Users lamented the fragility of platform-hosted content, noting how corporate-controlled platforms leave little trace when content is removed (e.g., YouTube’s bare footer). Simon Willison linked to [a blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct6/openai-dvdy-lv-blg/) discussing this issue.  

2. **AI Model Speculation**:  
   - Comments debated OpenAI’s Codex CLI/Cloud updates (GA release on Oct 20) and GPT-5’s rumored capabilities, with users questioning whether API benchmarks truly reflect "GPT-5 Pro" reasoning.  
   - Skepticism arose about corporate transparency, with comparisons to "Entropix 0.0" (a fictional reference) and claims that OpenAI might obscure model details.  

3. **Meta’s Live Demo Mishap**: A subthread humorously speculated that Meta’s live demo failure (likely an unreferenced event) avoided embarrassment by cutting content short, with jabs at Twitter’s role in amplifying tech drama.  

4. **Accessibility Note**: One user requested a transcript of the (inaccessible) YouTube video, highlighting the importance of text alternatives.  

**Tone**: Mix of technical analysis, cynicism about corporate control of content/AI, and wry humor (e.g., "Terrifying disaster humanity person allowed impact children" – likely a hyperbolic joke). The discussion underscored concerns about digital preservation and opaque AI development practices.

### What GPT-OSS leaks about OpenAI's training data

#### [Submission URL](https://fi-le.net/oss/) | 311 points | by [fi-le](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fi-le) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483924)

The Fiefdom of Files: What GPT-oss leaks about OpenAI’s training data

- Core idea: By inspecting the open weights of OpenAI’s GPT-oss (and the shared o200k tokenizer used across recent models), the author shows that model parameters leak clues about training data and process—down to surprisingly specific domains.

- How they probed it: They histogrammed the L2 norms of the token embedding rows. A cluster of ~936 very low-norm tokens (reserved specials and certain raw bytes) likely never appeared in training and were pulled down by weight decay—useful for inferring init variance and, in principle, total training steps. The right tail isn’t Gaussian: some tokens have unusually high norms.

- What popped out:
  - English high-norm tokens skew toward code and reasoning (“code”, “The”, “This”, “logic”, “according”, “Moreover”), hinting that code/reasoning was emphasized late in training (e.g., RL or fine-tuning) or simply received larger gradient updates.
  - Non-ASCII high-norm tokens include many Chinese spam and adult-website phrases, lottery/gambling terms, and assorted regional/odd tokens (Thai football-analysis terms, niche districts, Abkhaz/Armenian/Kannada snippets). The author argues this implies GPT-5 encountered phrases from adult sites.
  - The o200k tokenizer contains a lot of “junk” tokens; every inference still multiplies by embeddings for these, an efficiency and safety curiosity.

- Glitch tokens in the wild: A crafted Abkhaz input (“ауажәарақәа”) causes GPT-5 to output an unrelated Malayalam word (“people”), echoing prior “glitch token” phenomena (e.g., SolidGoldMagikarp) where certain byte-piece tokens behave adversarially.

- Why it matters: Even without a disclosed dataset, open weights and token stats can reveal training emphasis, data contamination (spam/adult content), and pipeline details—raising questions about data curation, safety, and the trade-offs of shared tokenizers across models.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Glitch Tokens & Model Weaknesses**:  
   - Users note the recurrence of "glitch tokens" (e.g., *SolidGoldMagikarp*) in OpenAI models, often tied to tokenizer artifacts or web-scraped data. These tokens, like the Abkhaz example triggering Malayalam output, highlight adversarial behavior in models.  
   - Some suggest **reverse-engineering** APIs or exploiting tokenizer quirks (e.g., `xddr` linked to FPGA tools or Unicode soft hyphens) could reveal training data patterns or weaknesses.

2. **Training Data Sources**:  
   - Debate arises over whether GPT-5’s training included **deleted or spammy content**, such as Chinese adult/gambling sites, GitHub repositories, or repackaged content from blocked platforms.  
   - Comments point to GitHub as a likely training source, given tokens matching repository terms. However, some argue this reflects the messy reality of web data, not intentional malpractice.

3. **Tokenizer Efficiency**:  
   - Criticism of the `o200k` tokenizer’s large size and low-quality tokens (e.g., junk phrases). Users propose smaller, optimized tokenizers could improve efficiency, especially for quantized models.

4. **Bias & Suppression**:  
   - Concerns that RLHF fine-tuning might **suppress biases** superficially without addressing deeper issues. Papers ([Carlini et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06634)) are cited, arguing models retain hidden biases or memorized data despite alignment efforts.  
   - Some note cultural biases in non-English tokens (e.g., Chinese spam terms) could skew outputs for non-native users.

5. **Legal & Ethical Calls**:  
   - Strong demands for **transparency laws** requiring documentation of training data sources. Comparisons are made to Google Books’ copyright disputes, highlighting the legal gray area of training on public/private data mixtures.  
   - Skepticism about current moderation practices, with users doubting OpenAI’s ability to filter harmful content entirely.

6. **Miscellaneous Insights**:  
   - The token `xddr`’s link to GitHub scrapes and Unicode encoding errors.  
   - Humorous speculation about the `o200k` tokenizer’s name (possibly referencing 200,000 tokens).  
   - Correction of a typo to the infamous *SolidGoldMagikarp* glitch token example.

**Key Debate**: Is the presence of spammy/deleted content in training data a sign of poor curation, or an inevitable byproduct of web scraping? While some see it as a red flag, others argue it’s unavoidable, reflecting the internet’s “noisy” nature. Calls for stricter dataset accountability clash with pragmatism about current AI development practices.

### Rule-Based Expert Systems: The Mycin Experiments (1984)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.shortliffe.net/Buchanan-Shortliffe-1984/MYCIN%20Book.htm) | 83 points | by [mindcrime](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mindcrime) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486306)

Rule-Based Expert Systems: The MYCIN Experiments (1984) — full book now free online

- What it is: A 754-page, out-of-print classic from Stanford’s Heuristic Programming Project, documenting the design, evaluation, and spin‑offs of MYCIN, a landmark rule-based medical expert system. All chapters are freely available.
- Why it matters: Captures the foundations of expert systems—knowledge engineering, explainability, and reasoning under uncertainty—that still inform modern AI (and serve as a sharp contrast to today’s LLMs).
- What MYCIN did: Used several hundred backward‑chaining rules and “certainty factors” to recommend antibiotic therapy for bacterial infections. It never went into clinical use, but became a touchstone for how AI can justify recommendations and separate knowledge from inference.
- Inside the book: 
  - Rule representation, inference engine, consultation flow, and therapy algorithms
  - Uncertainty handling: certainty factors, probabilistic reasoning, and Dempster–Shafer evidence
  - EMYCIN: a reusable shell for building rule‑based systems in new domains
  - Explanation generation, tutoring, and human‑factors design
  - Alternative representations (frames + rules) and meta‑level knowledge
  - A structured evaluation comparing MYCIN’s advice to infectious disease experts
- Big lessons: The knowledge acquisition bottleneck is real; explanations drive trust and learning; clear separation of knowledge base and engine aids reuse; uncertainty formalisms are pragmatic trade‑offs; deployment hinges on UX, integration, and liability as much as accuracy.
- Where to start: Ch. 11 (Inexact Reasoning), Ch. 15 (EMYCIN), Ch. 18 (Explanations), Ch. 31 (Evaluation).

Great historical read for anyone building decision support tools, explainable AI, or safety‑critical ML.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the historical significance of rule-based expert systems like MYCIN, their contrast with modern machine learning (ML), and lessons applicable to today’s AI development. Key points include:

1. **Rule-Based vs. Data-Driven Approaches**:  
   Participants highlight the trade-offs between hand-crafted rule-based systems (e.g., MYCIN) and modern ML/data-driven methods. While rule-based systems offer transparency and explainability, they face scalability and maintenance challenges (“knowledge acquisition bottleneck”). ML avoids manual rule-writing but struggles with interpretability and reliability.

2. **Historical Context**:  
   The conversation touches on pivotal moments in AI history, such as Marvin Minsky’s criticism of perceptrons in the 1960s, which stalled neural network research and fueled the rise of expert systems. MYCIN’s failure to deploy clinically (despite technical success) due to shifting pharmaceutical practices underscores the importance of real-world integration.

3. **Relevance Today**:  
   Some argue that hybrid systems combining Large Language Models (LLMs) with rule-based verification or symbolic reasoning could address modern AI’s limitations. Others note parallels between past challenges (e.g., integrating expert systems into workflows) and current issues with ML deployment (e.g., monitoring, interpretability).

4. **Lessons from MYCIN**:  
   Participants emphasize MYCIN’s enduring lessons:  
   - **Explainability** drives trust and usability.  
   - **Separation of knowledge and inference** aids adaptability (e.g., EMYCIN shell).  
   - **Uncertainty handling** (e.g., certainty factors) remains relevant for decision-making systems.  

5. **Nostalgia and Revival**:  
   Older tools like OPS5 and Prolog are mentioned as inspirations, with some advocating revisiting their principles. The discussion also critiques the “AI winter” narrative, noting that expert systems’ decline was as much about hype and practicality as technical merit.

6. **Modern Experiments**:  
   Developers share experiments using LLMs for scripting and verification, suggesting that blending generative AI with structured rule-based systems could mitigate brittleness while retaining flexibility.

**Takeaway**: The MYCIN experiments and rule-based systems offer timeless insights for today’s AI, particularly in explainability, hybrid architectures, and the socio-technical challenges of deploying systems in real-world settings. The discussion reflects a community keen on learning from history to avoid repeating past mistakes.

### Managing context on the Claude Developer Platform

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/news/context-management) | 214 points | by [benzguo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=benzguo) | [85 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45479006)

Anthropic adds “context editing” and a client-side “memory tool” to the Claude Developer Platform to tame context-window limits and power longer-running agents, launching with Claude Sonnet 4.5.

What’s new
- Context editing: Automatically prunes stale tool calls/results as you approach token limits, preserving conversation flow and focusing the model on what’s relevant.
- Memory tool: A file-based, developer-managed store (CRUD via tool calls) that lives outside the context window and persists across sessions, letting agents accumulate knowledge, project state, and learnings over time.
- Built-in awareness: Sonnet 4.5 tracks available tokens to manage context more intelligently.

Why it matters
- Longer, cheaper, more accurate runs: On Anthropic’s internal agentic-search evals, memory + context editing improved performance 39% over baseline; editing alone delivered 29%. In a 100-turn web search test, context editing avoided context exhaustion while cutting token use by 84%.
- Developer control: Memory operates entirely client-side; you choose the storage backend and persistence model—no opaque server-side state.

Use cases
- Coding: Trim old file reads/tests while persisting debugging insights and design decisions.
- Research: Keep key findings; drop outdated search results to build a durable knowledge base.
- Data processing: Store intermediates, discard raw bulk to stay under token limits.

Availability
- Public beta on the Claude Developer Platform, plus Amazon Bedrock and Google Cloud Vertex AI. Docs and cookbook available.

The Hacker News discussion on Anthropic's new context editing and memory tool features reveals mixed reactions and practical insights:

### **Key Themes**
1. **Comparisons with Existing Tools**  
   - Users note similarities to Google AI Studio’s context deletion and ChatGPT’s advanced modes, but praise Claude’s client-side memory control as a differentiating factor.  
   - Skepticism arises about benchmarks, with some arguing models like Gemini or GPT-4 still outperform Claude in real-world tasks.

2. **Workflow Adaptations**  
   - Developers share workarounds for context limits: compacting message history, using terminal tools ([plqqy-terminal](https://github.com/plqqy/plqqy-terminal)), or integrating version control for persistent state.  
   - One user highlights success with Claude Code, maintaining 10% context usage via compact histories during extended sessions.

3. **Challenges & Critiques**  
   - **Hallucination Risks**: Removing context chunks might lead to inaccuracies, especially in long agent runs.  
   - **Quality Trade-offs**: Aggressive context trimming risks degrading output quality, likened to “a significant disservice” in some cases.  
   - **Client-Side Complexity**: Managing memory via CRUD operations and Markdown files adds overhead, though some appreciate the transparency vs. opaque server-side state.

4. **Developer Control**  
   - Praise for client-side memory storage (e.g., `CURRENT.md` files) but frustration with manual context management in third-party interfaces.  
   - Requests for standardized context formats (akin to LoRA adapters) to streamline manipulation across platforms.

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Optimism about enabling multi-session learning and persistent project state.  
   - Criticism of AI’s practicality for complex workflows, citing a [linked blog](https://blog.nilen.com/2025/09/15/ai-not-for-work) arguing current tools fall short.

### **Notable Quotes**
- *“Context editing feels like formalizing common patterns… but vendors locking in APIs could limit flexibility.”*  
- *“Gemini 1.5 Pro’s massive context window is a game-changer—Anthropic’s token management feels like catching up.”*  
- *“I’ve been hacking this for months—Claude’s update just makes it official.”*

### **Conclusion**  
While developers welcome Anthropic’s focus on context efficiency and client-side control, debates persist over real-world efficacy vs. marketing claims. The features address pain points but highlight broader challenges in balancing token limits, cost, and output quality for AI agents.

### Estimating AI energy use

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-energy-use) | 99 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45486031)

IEEE Spectrum: The Hidden Behemoth Behind Every AI Answer

A simple “Hello” to ChatGPT rides on an enormous, fast-growing energy and infrastructure footprint. Using OpenAI’s own usage figures (700 million weekly users; 2.5 billion queries/day), Spectrum estimates nearly 1 trillion queries a year. If each query averages 0.34 Wh (a figure Sam Altman has floated without evidence), that’s about 850 MWh/day—roughly enough annualized to power ~29,000 U.S. homes. But per-query energy is highly uncertain: some researchers peg complex prompts at >20 Wh.

Zooming out, Schneider Electric’s research puts generative AI’s 2025 draw at 15 TWh, using ~2.9 Wh per query—implying ~5.1 trillion queries industry-wide. Their 2030 scenario jumps to 347 TWh/year and as many as 329 billion prompts per day (~38 per person), driven by autonomous AI agents talking to other agents. That leaves ~332 TWh of new energy demand to materialize this decade.

To keep up, AI firms are planning “Stargate-class” mega–data centers, with OpenAI and others signaling the need for dozens of them. Big picture: the bottleneck isn’t just GPUs—it’s power, land, and grid build-out. The article stresses that all these numbers have wide error bars due to limited disclosure, but the direction of travel is unmistakable: scale is the story.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy footprint revolves around the validity of estimates, infrastructure challenges, and broader implications raised in the IEEE Spectrum article. Here’s a distilled summary:

### Key Debate Points:
1. **Energy Estimates and Comparisons**  
   - Skepticism surrounds per-query energy figures (e.g., Sam Altman’s 0.34 Wh claim). Some argue training models, not just inference (queries), dominate energy use, but this is often omitted in analyses.  
   - Comparisons to other activities (e.g., a round-trip flight LA-Tokyo ≈ 1M Wh) are debated. Critics call these misleading, as AI’s impact should focus on systemic energy sinks, not individual equivalencies.  

2. **Infrastructure and Market Dynamics**  
   - Data centers strain grids, driving up electricity prices. Users note PJM Interconnection’s rates surged from $2,958/MW-day to $27,043/MW-day, hinting at broader consumer cost impacts.  
   - Some argue utilities prioritize profitable server contracts, passing infrastructure costs to residents. Others counter that market-driven pricing and long-term contracts are inevitable.  

3. **Renewables and Grid Challenges**  
   - Cheap, clean energy is seen as a solution, but political and logistical hurdles (e.g., NIMBYism, slow transmission upgrades) delay progress. Users cite Diablo Canyon’s relicensing battles and renewable project opposition as examples.  
   - Europe’s interconnected grids are discussed, but flaws emerge (e.g., Norway’s hydropower profits benefiting Germany’s industry, not locals).  

4. **Scale and Projections**  
   - The article’s 2030 projection of 347 TWh/year for AI is called a "small fraction" of global energy (≈180,000 TWh), but critics stress growth trajectories matter. Autonomous AI agents could drive exponential demand.  
   - Skeptics question whether efficiency gains can offset scaling, likening today’s AI boom to 2000s fiber-optic overinvestment.  

5. **Broader Implications**  
   - Concerns about AI becoming a scapegoat for decades of underinvestment in grids. Training data centers are likened to heavy industries (e.g., steel) with concentrated energy demands.  
   - Some suggest per-user energy accounting (like India’s tiered pricing) to align costs with usage fairly.  

### Sentiment:  
While most agree AI’s energy footprint is non-trivial and growing, opinions split on severity. Optimists highlight innovation and cleaner energy potential; pessimists stress infrastructure inertia and market distortions. The discussion underscores the need for transparency, holistic lifecycle analysis (training + inference), and policy foresight.

### Implicit Actor Critic Coupling via a Supervised Learning Framework for RLVR

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) | 38 points | by [getnormality](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=getnormality) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45483205)

What’s new: PACS reframes Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) as a supervised learning problem. Instead of updating policies with unstable policy gradients (PPO/GRPO), it treats the verifiable outcome (e.g., correct math answer, passing tests) as a label and trains a score function with cross-entropy. The authors show this recovers the classic policy-gradient update while implicitly coupling the actor and critic, leading to more stable, efficient training.

Why it matters: RLVR has been a bright spot for LLM reasoning, but sparse rewards and high-variance updates make it brittle and hard to tune. A supervised formulation could simplify pipelines, reduce instability, and make scaling easier when rewards are easy to verify.

Results: On challenging math benchmarks, PACS beats strong RL baselines. Notably, it reaches 59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025, improving over PPO by 13.32 points and GRPO by 14.36 points.

Takeaway: If these gains generalize, PACS offers a cleaner, more robust route to post-train LLMs on tasks with verifiable feedback, potentially lowering RL complexity without sacrificing performance. Code and data are open-sourced.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the submission:

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Comparison to Decision Transformers (DTs):**  
   A user ([radarsat1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=radarsat1)) questions whether PACS overlaps with Decision Transformers, which condition on desired returns and generate actions. They note a lack of recent follow-up work on DTs and suggest a deeper comparison.

2. **Skepticism About Results:**  
   [mpssblfrk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpssblfrk) raises doubts about the reported **59.78% pass@256 on AIME 2025**, arguing that stopping points for such benchmarks can be arbitrary. They also highlight that top models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1, Google/OpenAI) have not publicly achieved similar results, hinting at potential discrepancies.

3. **Technical Accessibility:**  
   [gtnrmlty](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gtnrmlty) critiques the paper’s dense presentation (e.g., Figures 1–2, Equation 6) but praises its core idea of leveraging supervised learning for RL stability. They also mention parallels to **DPO (Direct Preference Optimization)** and reference Equation 8 from the DPO paper.

4. **Related Work & Resources:**  
   [yrwb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yrwb) shares links to the [PACS paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02522) and a related ["Winning Gold IMO 2025" pipeline paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15855), prompting thanks from others for the resources.

### Takeaways:
- The discussion reflects cautious optimism about PACS but emphasizes the need for clearer benchmarks and comparisons to existing methods (DTs, DPO).  
- Skepticism about the AIME 2025 result underscores broader concerns around reproducibility and evaluation rigor in LLM reasoning tasks.  
- The supervised learning angle is seen as promising for simplifying RL pipelines, though technical clarity remains a hurdle.

### The deadline isn't when AI outsmarts us – it's when we stop using our own minds

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theargumentmag.com/p/you-have-18-months) | 353 points | by [NotInOurNames](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=NotInOurNames) | [309 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45480622)

Title: “You have 18 months” — The real deadline isn’t AI surpassing us, it’s us surrendering our minds

- Derek Thompson argues the near-term risk of AI isn’t mass displacement by “a country of geniuses in a datacenter,” but human deskilling as we outsource thinking. He reframes “18 months” as the window to protect our cognitive habits, not a countdown to obsolescence.

- Core idea: thinking, like strength training, depends on “time under tension.” Slow, effortful synthesis is how ideas become original. Offloading that struggle to AI short-circuits the very process that builds judgment and creativity.

- Writing is thinking: letting LLMs draft for us fills screens with words while emptying minds of thought. A Nature editorial warns that outsourcing scientific writing erodes understanding. In education, ubiquitous AI use turns assignments into prompt engineering, not learning.

- Reading is collapsing too. Thompson cites:
  - NAEP: U.S. average reading scores at a 32-year low.
  - John Burn-Murdoch’s Financial Times analysis asking if we’ve “passed peak brain power.”
  - A professor’s account of “functional illiteracy” among college students.
  The shift to fragments (texts, feeds, subtitles) erodes the sustained attention needed for deep comprehension.

- The parental panic—“Which major is safe if AI beats us at coding, medicine, math?”—misses the present-tense problem: deteriorating habits of focus, reading, and writing that make people valuable in any field.

- Practical takeaway: use AI as a tutor or brainstorming aid, not a ghostwriter; require drafts and “show your work” in schools and teams; schedule deliberate “slow work” (reading, outlining, rewriting) to keep cognitive muscles under tension.

- The challenge for the next 18 months isn’t preventing AI from outskilling us—it’s refusing to deskill ourselves. The deadline is behavioral, not technological.

### ProofOfThought: LLM-based reasoning using Z3 theorem proving

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/DebarghaG/proofofthought) | 305 points | by [barthelomew](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=barthelomew) | [155 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45475529)

Proof of Thought: LLM thinks, Z3 checks. This open-source repo (DebarghaG/proofofthought) pairs a large language model with the Z3 SMT solver to turn natural-language questions into symbolic programs that are formally checked, aiming for reasoning that’s both robust and interpretable. The accompanying paper, “Proof of thought: Neurosymbolic program synthesis allows robust and interpretable reasoning,” was presented at the Sys2Reasoning Workshop (NeurIPS 2024).

Why it matters
- Reliability: Offloads logical consistency to Z3, reducing brittle chains of thought and hallucinations.
- Interpretability: Produces explicit constraints/assumptions instead of opaque reasoning.
- Reproducibility: Solver-backed outcomes and failure modes are easier to audit.

Highlights
- Two-layer design: a high-level Python API (z3dsl.reasoning.ProofOfThought) for simple queries, and a low-level JSON-based DSL that interfaces with Z3.
- Batch evaluation pipeline with example datasets (e.g., StrategyQA), plus Azure OpenAI support.
- Minimal setup: pip install z3-solver, openai, scikit-learn, numpy; requires an OpenAI-compatible LLM key.
- Example usage shows querying a factual/political question and getting a solver-validated answer.
- Active repo: Python-only, tests and examples included; ~260 stars at posting.

Bottom line: A clean, practical neurosymbolic toolkit that lets LLMs propose reasoning steps while an SMT solver guarantees the logic, making it a compelling option for tasks where correctness and auditability matter.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Proof of Thought" project highlights several key themes and debates:

### **Core Technical Debate**
1. **Symbolic + LLM Synergy**: Many agree that pairing LLMs with formal systems (Z3, SymPy, Prolog) improves reliability by offloading logic checks to deterministic tools. Examples include:
   - Using SymPy for symbolic math instead of relying on fuzzy LLM outputs.
   - Proposing Prolog/Datalog as alternatives for neurosymbolic reasoning ([brthlmw](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20047)).

2. **Determinism vs. Non-Determinism**: 
   - Some argue deterministic solvers (Z3) are faster/cheaper for verification, while others note non-determinism is unavoidable in cryptography or creative tasks.
   - A subthread critiques whether "deterministic computation" is always feasible, citing randomized algorithms like quicksort.

### **Use Cases and Comparisons**
- **Business Systems**: Complex real-world applications (e.g., double-entry accounting) require blending human psychology, economic theory, and symbolic tools, raising concerns about alignment and practicality.
- **Simulations**: Ideas like MuZero-style self-play environments or simulated training data are suggested for improving LLM alignment with real-world constraints.
- **Wolfram Alpha Comparison**: Users contrast LLMs with symbolic systems like Wolfram Alpha, noting calculators are "reliable but not AI."

### **Practical Insights**
- **Testing/Verification**: Commenters emphasize the importance of test suites and iterative refinement (e.g., `nthrplg`'s SymPy workflow with assertions).
- **Prototyping Challenges**: Teams like `LASR` share struggles in scaling neurosymbolic prototypes (e.g., converting docs to LEAN proofs) due to engineering complexity.

### **Tangents and Community Vibes**
- A lighthearted detour about 1999 sci-fi films (*The Thirteenth Floor*, *Matrix*) emerges, showcasing HN’s nostalgic side.
- Skepticism persists about LLMs’ numerical reasoning, with debates on whether neurons "crunch numbers" or process abstractly.

### **Key Takeaway**
The consensus favors **neurosymbolic approaches** as promising for high-stakes domains, but highlights challenges in implementation, scalability, and aligning LLM creativity with formal rigor. The discussion reflects optimism about tools like Z3/SymPy enhancing trust in LLMs, tempered by pragmatism about technical and real-world hurdles.

### Matrix Core Programming on AMD GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://salykova.github.io/matrix-cores-cdna) | 102 points | by [skidrow](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=skidrow) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45476821)

Programming AMD Matrix Cores in HIP: FP8/FP4 and block‑scaled MFMA on CDNA4

Highlights
- What it is: A hands-on guide to using AMD’s Matrix Cores from HIP, with code and diagrams covering MFMA intrinsics, required data layouts, and modern low‑precision formats (FP16, FP8, FP6, FP4). Also introduces CDNA4’s new Matrix Core instructions with exponent block scaling.
- Why it matters: Mixed-precision MFMA can deliver massive speedups for AI/HPC GEMMs while accumulating in FP32 to limit accuracy loss.
- Key numbers:
  - CDNA3 (MI325X): FP16 ~8x, FP8 ~16x vs FP32; 1.3–2.6 PF equivalent throughput on matrix cores.
  - CDNA4 (MI355X): FP16 ~16x (2.5 PF), FP8 ~32x (5 PF), FP6/FP4 up to ~64x (10 PF) vs FP32.
- Formats demystified: Clear walkthrough of exponent/mantissa/bias, special values, and conversions for FP16/BF16, FP8 (E4M3, E5M2), FP6 (E3M2), and FP4 (E2M1). Explains the FNUZ variants (unsigned zero, finite-only) and what special values each supports.

What’s new on CDNA4
- Higher MFMA throughput for FP16/FP8 and added FP6/FP4 instructions.
- Exponent block scaling instructions: per‑block scaling to extend dynamic range for ultra‑low precision types without leaving the matrix core fast path.

Practical takeaways
- Accumulate in FP32 even when inputs are FP16/FP8/FP4 to preserve accuracy.
- Choose FP8 E4M3 vs E5M2 based on needed precision vs range; be mindful of FNUZ behavior (e.g., no infinities, unsigned zero).
- Data layout matters: the blog shows how to tile, pack, and feed fragments that MFMA expects in HIP kernels.
- Comes with HIP intrinsics and code samples to get started; also published on the ROCm blog.

Who should read
- Kernel authors and ML/HPC engineers targeting AMD Instinct GPUs who want to hand‑tune GEMMs/attention blocks with FP8/FP4 on CDNA3/CDNA4.

Here’s a concise summary of the discussion:

**Key Themes**  
1. **Appreciation for AMD’s Approach**: Users welcome AMD’s hardware acceleration efforts and matrix core diversity. One comment notes AMD’s direct publishing of technical content (e.g., GitHub, blogs) as a positive step.  

2. **Architectural Nuances**:  
   - Debate arises over AMD’s Matrix Core implementation vs. NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores. AMD’s design distributes matrix units across SMs (Streaming Multiprocessors), allowing finer-grained control, while NVIDIA’s Tensor Cores operate as separate units.  
   - A user likens AMD’s approach to AVX512 extensions, contrasting it with NVIDIA’s "heterogeneous" Tensor Core model and Intel’s AMX.  

3. **Programming Model Challenges**:  
   - Confusion exists around programming paradigms: CUDA’s warp-centric model vs. AMD’s SM-distributed matrix cores. Some argue CUDA’s abstraction hides hardware complexity, while AMD’s approach requires deeper control.  
   - Concerns about branch divergence in matrix operations are dismissed, as matrix multiplication is inherently SIMT-friendly.  

4. **Analogy-Driven Critique**:  
   A car highway analogy critiques thread independence assumptions in GPU programming models, highlighting the complexity of managing parallel execution lanes (e.g., 32-core "cars" with restricted lane-switching).  

**Implications**  
The discussion reflects interest in AMD’s matrix core flexibility but underscores the learning curve for developers accustomed to NVIDIA’s abstractions. Clearer documentation and comparisons to CUDA/Tensor Cores could help bridge this gap.

### AI-powered open-source code laundering

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/SudoMaker/rEFui/blob/main/HALL_OF_SHAME.md) | 101 points | by [genkiuncle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=genkiuncle) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45477661)

rEFui (GitHub): A new open-source project aiming to deliver a cleaner, more polished UI for UEFI boot selection. While the repo page snippet here is limited, the name and early traction suggest a lightweight boot picker that could appeal to multi-boot users and folks tweaking older Macs or PC UEFI setups. If you care about the first impression your machine makes at boot—and want something simpler than full-fledged boot managers—this looks worth a peek.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary: Ethical, Legal, and Societal Debates Around AI and Open Source**

### **Key Themes**  
1. **Open Source Exploitation & Trust**  
   - Concerns arose about bad actors misusing open-source projects, leading to spam, degraded trust, and commodification of shared resources (e.g., "greedy people spoil good things"). Critics argue this undermines decades of FOSS (Free and Open Source Software) contributions.  
   - Counterpoints highlight FOSS’s resilience over 30–40 years, though issues like verbatim code copying in repositories raise legal questions about derivative work boundaries.

2. **AI, Copyright, and Creative Industries**  
   - Debates centered on whether AI-generated content (code, art, text) constitutes copyright infringement. Users questioned if AI merely refactors existing works (e.g., Photoshop-style tools predating LLMs) or creates transformative outputs.  
   - Specific examples included AI replicating Van Gogh’s style without compensating original creators, sparking arguments about attribution, compensation, and the ethics of training data. Critics likened unchecked AI use to "plagiarism on steroids," while proponents saw potential for democratizing creativity.  

3. **Societal Impact of AI**  
   - Fears of job displacement dominated, with concerns that AI devalues human labor, especially in "white-collar" roles. Universities faced scrutiny for charging high tuition for degrees (e.g., Tourism Studies) with questionable ROI, exacerbating student debt.  
   - Some argued AI could reduce demand for traditional college degrees, favoring skill-based signaling (e.g., apprenticeships). Others warned of a widening wealth gap, where only the privileged access AI-driven opportunities.  

4. **Open Source vs. Proprietary AI Control**  
   - Tensions arose over whether AI models should be open-source. Critics noted that even "open" models (e.g., LLMs) often rely on proprietary training data, making true reproducibility impractical for individuals.  
   - Concerns about centralization: A few corporations or small groups controlling foundational AI models, limiting democratic access.  

### **Notable Threads**  
- **Copyright Nightmares**: Users likened AI training on copyrighted material to “looter algorithms” profiting from aggregated human creativity. Legal challenges (e.g., Adobe’s AI tools) highlighted clashes between innovation and intellectual property rights.  
- **Education Crisis**: Comments questioned the value of degrees in a post-AI world, noting rising debt and underemployment. Some advocated for vocational training over traditional academia.  
- **AI and Human Creativity**: While some saw AI as a tool to enhance human creativity, others feared it would homogenize outputs, eroding cultural diversity and individual artistic voices.  

### **Conclusion**  
The discussion reflects a community grappling with AI’s dual potential: democratizing innovation versus entrenching inequities. Legal frameworks, ethical training practices, and equitable access emerged as critical needs to balance AI’s promise with societal well-being.

### How to inject knowledge efficiently? Knowledge infusion scaling law for LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19371) | 99 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [32 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45474900)

TL;DR: The authors identify a “critical collapse point” where adding too much domain-specific pretraining causes a sharp drop in previously learned knowledge (memory collapse). They show this threshold scales predictably with model size, and propose a scaling law that lets you determine the optimal domain-token budget for large models by probing smaller ones.

Key ideas
- Memory collapse: Past a certain ratio of domain tokens in continued pretraining, general knowledge and retention degrade abruptly rather than gradually.
- Scale correlation: The collapse threshold isn’t arbitrary—it moves with model size in a consistent way.
- Scaling law: Use small, cheap models to map the collapse point and predict the safe/optimal domain-infusion budget for larger models.
- Evidence: Experiments across multiple model sizes and token budgets suggest the law generalizes.

Why it matters
- Practical knob: Gives teams a principled way to set domain data ratios for continued pretraining, avoiding catastrophic forgetting while still gaining specialization.
- Cost saver: Find the right mix on small models, then scale up—reducing trial-and-error on expensive runs.
- Hallucination control: Better domain grounding without nuking general capabilities.

Open questions for practitioners
- Exact formula/exponents and how sensitive they are across domains (e.g., code vs. biomed vs. legal).
- Interaction with data quality, curriculum, and replay/regularization methods.
- How this compares with alternative strategies (mixture-of-corpora scheduling, EWC/L2 regularization, LoRA domain heads).

Paper: “How to inject knowledge efficiently? Knowledge Infusion Scaling Law for Pre-training Large Language Models” (arXiv:2509.19371, Sep 19, 2025) DOI: https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2509.19371

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the challenges and implications of injecting domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, with critiques and extensions of the paper's approach. Key points include:

1. **Critiques of Structured Knowledge Injection:**
   - **mtkrsk** questions using low-entropy structured data (e.g., Wikidata triples), arguing it reduces linguistic diversity and skews token statistics. Real-world domain data is seen as more varied and context-rich.
   - **mgclhpp** contrasts this with a physics-focused paper where varying sentence structures improved knowledge retention, suggesting rigid templates may hinder generalization.

2. **Training Methodology Debates:**
   - **lbg** and **jk** discuss whether strict token-matching loss functions (e.g., punishing deviations from training data) risk oversimplification vs. allowing diverse responses. **dtnchn** humorously likens this to human memorization struggles.

3. **Symbolic AI vs. LLM Integration:**
   - **gntcps** reflects on historical symbolic AI approaches, questioning if hybrid systems (knowledge graphs + LLMs) could resolve issues. **spnkl** and others debate whether LLMs build "world models" or merely optimize token prediction, with **smsl** and **ndrwflnr** arguing token prediction inherently requires some world understanding.

4. **Model Capacity and Memory Collapse:**
   - **dshrm** seeks formulas linking model size to memory limits, sparking a technical thread on neural network storage capacity. References include Gardner's classical 2-bits/parameter rule vs. newer claims (~3.6 bits) and debates on error-tolerant compression metrics.

5. **Practical Applications and Cost Concerns:**
   - **tssd** highlights structured prompts (e.g., UML diagrams) for coding tasks. **daft_pink** and **smnw** discuss cost trade-offs between domain-specific pretraining and fine-tuning, with **jk** noting retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) as a flexible alternative.
   - **hllrth** raises handling contradictions in knowledge (e.g., conflicting Hacker News comments), with **smnw** suggesting LLMs can reconcile these via context and external tools.

6. **Miscellaneous Insights:**
   - **th0ma5** challenges unsourced claims, emphasizing empirical validation. **gdms** praises the paper's domain-data focus, reflecting broader interest in specialized LLM applications.

**Key Takeaways:**  
The discussion underscores skepticism toward rigid knowledge injection methods, advocating for varied training data and hybrid approaches. Debates on model capacity and cost highlight the complexity of balancing specialization with general capabilities. Practical solutions like RAG and structured prompts emerge as alternatives to costly retraining.

### Whiteboarding with AI

#### [Submission URL](https://jrfernandez.com/whiteboarding-with-ai/) | 24 points | by [dirtyhand](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dirtyhand) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45477394)

A developer argues that AI coding agents produce much better results when you start with a structured “whiteboarding” phase in Markdown—mapping the problem space, sketching architecture, and iterating on design—before asking any model to write code.

Key points:
- Separate design from implementation: use a smarter model (e.g., Claude Opus) to co-develop a detailed plan/spec, then hand execution to a cheaper model (e.g., Sonnet). This cuts cost, improves code quality, and reduces bugs.
- Persistent “whiteboard”: the Markdown planning doc becomes living documentation and a spec you refine with the model instead of ephemeral sketches.
- Visual thinking with Mermaid: quickly generate and iterate on system, sequence, and ER diagrams in seconds, keeping visuals in sync with the evolving design.
- Learning new codebases: have the model analyze a repo and produce a tailored explainer with diagrams; iterate until you understand the architecture your way.
- Tooling: the author built mdserve (a fast Rust-based Markdown preview server with Mermaid, themes, and live reload) and pairs it with Neovim for quick edits and a terminal for running code, spending most time in the planning doc.
- Mindset shift: treat the model like a senior pairing partner for exploration and architecture; let it type only after the hard thinking is done.

Why it matters: This workflow turns AI into a design companion, not just an autocomplete engine—leading to clearer specs, fewer mistakes, and faster iteration.

The Hacker News discussion highlights key nuances and extensions of the submission's AI whiteboarding approach:

1. **Focus on substance over polish** (NBJack):  
   Users emphasize that AI-generated diagrams free developers from formatting minutiae, letting them focus on core architectural understanding ("learning box sizes") rather than aesthetic perfection. Some note physical whiteboards/pen-and-paper still have value for initial spatial reasoning before digital refinement.

2. **AI as collaborative debugger**:  
   Commenters suggest treating AI as more than a spec generator – e.g., a "rubber duck" for debugging via synthesized speech/chat, helping articulate system relationships that text alone might miss.

3. **Tool preferences emerge**:  
   While the submission uses Mermaid, some users advocate alternatives like [d2](https://d2lang.com/) for diagramming, highlighting ongoing experimentation in the ecosystem.

4. **Integration with existing patterns**:  
   A reminder (srls) that structured planning (bullet points, outlines) should map to established frameworks like Rails MVC when applicable, avoiding over-engineering vertical slices without context.

5. **Documentation gaps**:  
   NBJack observes few solutions effectively document component associations/groupings visually, implying room for improvement in AI-assisted architectural storytelling.

### Microsoft 365 Copilot's commercial failure

#### [Submission URL](https://www.perspectives.plus/p/microsoft-365-copilot-commercial-failure) | 167 points | by [jukkan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jukkan) | [124 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45476045)

Microsoft 365 Copilot’s commercial flop? A leaked tally says yes

- What’s claimed: Blogger Jukka Niiranen cites Ed Zitron’s newsletter saying internal materials show about 8 million active licensed Microsoft 365 Copilot users as of August 2025—roughly a 1.81% conversion of Microsoft’s ~440 million M365 subscribers. Copilot launched for enterprises Nov 1, 2023; the author projects adoption hovering around 2% by Nov 2025.
- Why that’s bad: Microsoft has pushed Copilot harder than almost any product, at $30/user/month. The post argues that even with executive mandates to “do AI,” most users don’t see enough day‑to‑day value to justify the cost.
- Partner angle: With ~400,000 Microsoft partners and few free seats in partner bundles, the author suggests a large chunk of paid seats may be partners buying their own—further questioning organic demand.
- Personal benchmark: The author says Copilot delivers less value than a cheaper ChatGPT Plus subscription for his workflow.
- Agents usage: Another leaked stat claims SharePoint’s AI features had fewer than 300,000 weekly active users in August, versus ~300 million SharePoint users—fuel for skepticism toward prior Microsoft brag numbers like “3 million agents in FY25.” He also notes UX gaps (e.g., SharePoint agents not usable in the M365 Copilot UI).
- Big picture: If accurate, the numbers point to a product–market fit problem for gen‑AI inside productivity suites: splashy demos and top‑down mandates haven’t translated into broad willingness to pay or sustained use.

Caveat: These figures are unverified leaks surfaced by Zitron; Microsoft hasn’t confirmed them. The author argues they track with slow uptake seen across other paid AI add‑ons.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Microsoft 365 Copilot Adoption:**

1. **Adoption Challenges and User Experience:**
   - Users report **slow adoption** in enterprises, with employees preferring alternatives like **ChatGPT** or **Claude** due to Copilot’s restrictive post-setup functionality and predictability. Technical integration hurdles (e.g., SharePoint/Teams search issues) and poor usability (e.g., clunky UI) further hinder adoption.
   - **Enterprise risk aversion** and bureaucratic inertia are cited as barriers, with large organizations hesitant to adopt AI tools that disrupt existing workflows without clear ROI.

2. **Comparisons to Alternatives:**
   - Copilot is criticized as **inferior to ChatGPT** for personal workflows, with users noting its lower quality and higher cost ($30/user/month). Some argue Microsoft is rebranding existing services (e.g., Edge vs. Chrome) rather than innovating.

3. **Licensing and Monetization Concerns:**
   - Complex licensing models (e.g., Copilot Studio requiring expensive licenses for full data access) and unclear value propositions deter companies. Critics suggest Microsoft’s strategy—bundling Copilot into Office/Teams packages—prioritizes long-term monetization over immediate utility.

4. **Technical and Integration Issues:**
   - Poor integration with internal data systems (e.g., SharePoint) and unreliable search functionality frustrate users. Technical debt in organizations (e.g., outdated documentation, broken links) exacerbates Copilot’s limitations.
   - Skepticism surrounds Microsoft’s claims of "3 million agents," with leaked stats (e.g., 300k weekly SharePoint AI users) fueling doubts.

5. **Broader AI Bubble Concerns:**
   - Users speculate about an **AI bubble**, fearing Copilot’s low adoption reflects broader market disillusionment. Some hope for a correction to redirect investment toward practical, incremental AI improvements.

6. **Mixed Outlook on Microsoft’s Strategy:**
   - While some acknowledge Microsoft’s long-term play (e.g., habituating users via default installations), others criticize its reliance on "boring" enterprise lock-in tactics. The need for **better workflow integration** and gradual, ROI-driven AI adoption is emphasized.

**Key Takeaway:** The discussion paints Copilot as a tool struggling with product-market fit, hindered by technical flaws, high costs, and competition from more flexible AI alternatives. While Microsoft’s bundling strategy may secure long-term revenue, skepticism persists about Copilot’s current value and the viability of enterprise AI adoption at scale.

### Flock's gunshot detection microphones will start listening for human voices

#### [Submission URL](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/10/flocks-gunshot-detection-microphones-will-start-listening-human-voices) | 327 points | by [hhs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hhs) | [250 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45473698)

The Electronic Frontier Foundation warns that Flock Safety is expanding its Raven gunshot detection system to also flag “human distress” via audio—marketing materials show police being alerted for “screaming.” EFF argues this is surveillance creep: citywide, always‑on microphones that already struggle with false positives (think fireworks and car backfires) now venturing into voice detection.

Key concerns:
- How it works is opaque: Flock hasn’t explained what audio is analyzed, whether speech is stored, or how models distinguish “distress” from everyday noise.
- Legal risk: State eavesdropping/wiretap laws often restrict recording conversations in public; cities could face lawsuits.
- Safety risk: False alerts can escalate police encounters. EFF cites a Chicago incident where police, responding to a gunshot detector alert, shot at a child.
- Track record: Flock has sparked legal and governance issues before—alleged ICE access to Illinois plate data, a statewide halt in North Carolina over licensing, and a dispute in Evanston after contract cancellation. One Illinois trustee noted “over 99% of Flock alerts do not result in any police action.”

Why it matters: Cities adopting Raven’s new feature could inherit liability and civil-liberties headaches without clear evidence of benefit. EFF urges municipalities to demand transparency—or cancel contracts—before deploying microphones that listen for human voices.

The Hacker News discussion reflects widespread concern over Flock Safety’s expansion of its audio surveillance system to detect “human distress,” echoing the EFF’s warnings. Key points from the debate include:

1. **Surveillance Creep & Profit Motives**: Users criticize the shift toward profit-driven surveillance, arguing it prioritizes corporate interests over civil liberties. Comparisons are drawn to school systems using keyword-detecting microphones (e.g., HALO Detect), with fears that limited initial use cases (e.g., detecting “Help”) could expand into broader speech monitoring.

2. **Transparency & Trust Issues**: Commenters highlight Flock’s opaque operations, including unclear data retention policies and algorithmic accuracy. Skepticism about corporate-government collusion emerges, with references to Flock’s past controversies (e.g., ICE data access, contract disputes).

3. **Safety & Legal Risks**: Concerns about false positives escalating police encounters are raised, citing incidents like a Chicago child being shot after a faulty alert. Legal risks under wiretap laws are noted, with some users warning of lawsuits against cities adopting such systems.

4. **Political Divides**: The discussion touches on ideological splits, with some users blaming “progressive” policies for enabling surveillance overreach, while others criticize conservative-leaning entities for pushing authoritarian tech. Distrust in both government and corporations is a recurring theme.

5. **Normalization & Slippery Slopes**: Commenters fear normalization of constant monitoring, particularly in schools, and mission creep toward pervasive surveillance. HALO’s bathroom sensors and Flock’s partnerships are cited as examples of invasive tech adoption.

6. **Calls for Action**: Many urge municipalities to demand transparency or cancel contracts, emphasizing the lack of proven benefits and potential for harm. The EFF’s stance is broadly supported as a necessary check on unchecked surveillance expansion.

Overall, the thread underscores deep unease about the erosion of privacy, corporate influence in public safety, and the ethical implications of deploying unproven, opaque technologies in communities.

### Circular Financing: Does Nvidia's $110B Bet Echo the Telecom Bubble?

#### [Submission URL](https://tomtunguz.com/nvidia_nortel_vendor_financing_comparison/) | 223 points | by [miltava](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=miltava) | [202 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45473033)

HN Digest: Is Nvidia Replaying Lucent’s Vendor-Financing Bubble?

- The setup: Nvidia’s pledged $100B to OpenAI (Sept 2025) in 10 milestone-tied tranches, structured as leases (“Most of the money will go back to Nvidia”). Add ~$10B more in GPU‑backed debt broadly, plus stakes like $3B in CoreWeave (which has bought $7.5B of Nvidia GPUs) and NVentures’ $3.7B across AI startups. US tech is on track to spend $300–$400B on AI infra in 2025 while David Cahn pegs a ~$600B revenue gap.

- Why this rhymes with 1999–2002: Lucent et al. juiced sales with vendor financing (Lucent $8.1B; Nortel $3.1B; Cisco $2.4B). When funding dried up, 47 CLECs failed, 33–80% of vendor loans went bad, and fiber ran at ~0.002% of capacity. Lucent’s revenue fell 69% from 1999 to 2002 and never recovered.

- Nvidia’s exposure vs Lucent’s: In 2024 dollars, Lucent’s vendor financing was ~$15B; Nvidia’s direct investments are ~$110B, plus $15B+ in GPU‑collateralized debt in the ecosystem. Relative to revenue, Nvidia’s exposure (~85% of $130B) looks ~4x Lucent’s. Concentration risk is higher too: top 2 customers are 39% of Nvidia revenue (vs 23% at Lucent); 88% of revenue is data center.

- The new fragility: GPU‑backed loans (~14% rates) assume GPUs retain value 4–6 years, but real‑world AI GPU lifetimes look closer to 1–3 years at high utilization. Depreciation lives have been stretched (AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, META), with Amazon reversing from 6→5 years in 2025. Reported failure/attrition data (e.g., Meta’s ~9% annual GPU failures; Google architects citing 1–2 year lifetimes at 60–70% utilization) undercut collateral assumptions.

- Off‑balance‑sheet echoes: Hyperscalers are using SPVs with private debt to build and control data centers without consolidating them, obscuring true leverage and capex in a way reminiscent of past off‑balance‑sheet guarantees.

- What’s different (and what isn’t): Nvidia’s OpenAI deal is milestone‑based and lease‑structured, which offers more control than pure loans—but the cash still cycles back to Nvidia hardware, amplifying cyclicality. GPUs are more fungible than fiber, but if secondary prices slide and failure rates stay high, recovery on collateral could disappoint.

- Watchlist for the turn: secondary GPU prices, depreciation‑life revisions, SPV debt growth, customer concentration shifts, OpenAI cash flow vs lease obligations, and whether AI revenue ramps anywhere near the $300–$400B 2025 spend. The similarities to the telecom overbuild are striking; the durability of GPU economics will decide if this ends in a soft landing—or a Lucent‑style unwind.

The Hacker News discussion explores parallels between Nvidia’s current AI infrastructure investments and the late-1990s telecom bubble, while also branching into broader debates about monopolies, regulation, and online platforms like Reddit. Key points include:

### **1. Telecom Bubble Echoes**
- **Historical Context**: Users recount the telecom crash (1999–2002), driven by vendor financing (e.g., Lucent, Nortel) and deregulation (Telecommunications Act of 1996). CLECs failed en masse, loans defaulted, and fiber infrastructure was underutilized.  
- **Nvidia Comparison**: Concerns arise about Nvidia’s $110B+ in GPU financing and ecosystem investments. Risks include GPU collateral depreciation (short lifespans at high utilization), hyperscalers’ off-balance-sheet debt, and customer concentration (top 2 clients = 39% of revenue).  
- **Sustainability Debate**: Skepticism about AI demand meeting $300–400B infrastructure spend, with some noting LLMs are shrinking and consumer hardware is catching up. Others argue GPUs’ fungibility and milestone-based deals (e.g., OpenAI) mitigate risks.

### **2. Monopolies and Regulation**
- **Power Dynamics**: Users cite Matt Stoller’s *Goliath* to argue monopolies stifle innovation. Tech giants (Google, Amazon, etc.) are accused of consolidating power, contrasting with Peter Thiel’s *Zero to One* advocacy for monopolistic dominance.  
- **Regulation’s Role**: Mixed views on whether post-1996 telecom regulation helped (e.g., enabling ISPs) or harmed (e.g., enabling consolidation). Some praise open-access rules for fostering internet growth, while others criticize regulatory capture.

### **3. Reddit and AI Perception**
- **Reddit as an Echo Chamber**: Users debate Reddit’s influence, with some calling it a “Skinner Box” that amplifies niche opinions (e.g., anti-AI sentiment) unrepresentative of broader trends. Moderators and platform design are seen as shaping discourse.  
- **AI Adoption Realities**: Despite Reddit’s vocal skepticism, some note ChatGPT’s 4% programming use suggests untapped potential. Others highlight non-technical users driving demand, questioning whether AI revenue can justify infrastructure costs.

### **4. Broader Economic Reflections**
- **Market Turnover vs. Monopolization**: Discussions contrast corporate turnover (1970s vs. today) and whether consolidation reflects innovation or stagnation.  
- **Depreciation Risks**: GPU failure rates (e.g., Meta’s 9% annual attrition) and stretched depreciation schedules (5–6 years vs. 1–3 realistic lifetimes) threaten collateral assumptions in GPU-backed loans.

### **Conclusion**
The thread blends cautionary tales from the telecom era with skepticism about AI’s economic viability, while touching on regulatory and platform dynamics. Opinions split between optimism (GPU flexibility, milestone controls) and pessimism (concentration risk, demand gaps), mirroring broader debates about tech cycles and power consolidation.
