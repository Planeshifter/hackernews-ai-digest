In the latest release of Android, Android 14 (API v34), modifications to system certificates have been further restricted, even on fully rooted devices. This move marks a departure from Android's initial promise of openness and user control. Previously, users were able to modify the set of trusted certificates on their devices, but with Android 14, this becomes much more challenging. The set of certificate authorities (CAs) on a device determines the security of encrypted network traffic, and restricting user control over this can have significant implications for privacy and security research, app debugging, and enterprise network configurations. While rooting Android devices has been a workaround to these limitations, it is not officially endorsed by Google. In the past, rooted devices allowed users to manually add trusted certificates to the system store through file modifications. However, this process can be complex, as the /system directory is typically read-only. Workarounds include making the /system directory writable or mounting a temporary read-write file system. These methods have been effective in providing interception setups on rooted Android devices and emulators, enabling developers and researchers to analyze app communications. However, with the tighter restrictions in Android 14, these methods may become less effective. Overall, this shift towards limited user control highlights the ongoing tension between openness and vendor control in the Android ecosystem.

### Designing deep networks to process other deep networks

#### [Submission URL](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/designing-deep-networks-to-process-other-deep-networks/) | 69 points | by [weird_science](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=weird_science) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37328609)

Researchers have explored the idea of designing deep neural networks (DNNs) that can process the weights of other neural networks, enabling them to perform operations on pretrained models. This concept has practical applications, such as editing 3D objects represented using Implicit Neural Representations or adapting image classifiers to different domains. Previous work has attempted to process deep weight spaces by vectorizing the parameters and applying a fully connected network. However, this approach overlooks the structural properties of neural networks and hurts generalization. To address this, researchers propose using deep architectures that are insensitive to transformations of model weights, similar to how convolutional neural networks are insensitive to image shifts. The study draws upon the field of Geometric Deep Learning, which focuses on learning objects while being invariant to transformations, to develop equivariant architectures. These architectures enable neural networks to effectively process the weights of other neural networks, creating opportunities for more efficient and flexible model operations.
