### America's future could hinge on whether AI slightly disappoints

#### [Submission URL](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/americas-future-could-hinge-on-whether) | 207 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [285 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45570973)

Noah Smith argues that the surprisingly resilient U.S. economy may be riding almost entirely on an AI investment boom — and that even a mild AI disappointment could flip growth into recession and redefine Trump’s second term.

Key points
- Mixed macro picture: Manufacturing is hurting from tariffs, payroll growth is soft, and consumer sentiment is dour — yet GDP nowcasts still show ~2% growth and prime-age employment near highs.
- AI as the swing factor: Estimates from Pantheon, Jason Furman, and others suggest AI-related capex accounts for a large share of 2025 growth; The Economist notes non-AI consumption, housing, and business investment are sluggish.
- Market concentration: AI-linked giants (Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple) now exceed 20% of the S&P 500; Sharma says AI names drove ~80% of 2025 stock gains.
- Policy carve-out: Despite broad tariffs, the Trump administration has largely spared the AI supply chain, implicitly betting on the sector to power growth.
- The downside risk: If AI slightly underdelivers, the danger isn’t just a stock pullback but an “industrial bubble” unwind — overbuilt datacenters, chip orders, and power projects meeting weaker returns, leading to loan stress and a broader downturn.
- Political stakes: If AI momentum fades and the economy sours, Smith argues Trump’s economic legacy could suffer a 2008-style narrative reversal.

What to watch
- AI capex guidance from hyperscalers and chipmakers; signs of order deferrals or capex cuts.
- Translation from spend to productivity and profits across non-tech sectors.
- Credit exposure to AI infrastructure (datacenters, utilities, specialized real estate) and any early default/credit spread signals.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around concerns about the U.S. economy’s reliance on AI investment, parallels to COVID-era disruptions, and political risks. Key themes include:

1. **AI Investment Skepticism:**  
   - Anecdotes suggest companies are projecting aggressive AI spending despite customers pushing back on costs. Some argue AI investments are "half-hearted," with corporations and investors engaging in speculative behavior ("musical chairs").  
   - Skepticism exists about whether AI-driven stock market gains (e.g., Nvidia, Microsoft) reflect real economic growth, as non-AI sectors (manufacturing, retail) show weakness.  

2. **Market Vulnerabilities:**  
   - Stock market resilience is attributed to cash flooding equities, not earnings. Investors mention shifting portfolios post-election (e.g., selling ETFs) and hedging with gold amid fears of corrections.  
   - Concerns about overexposure to AI infrastructure (data centers, chips) and potential "industrial bubble" risks if demand disappoints.  

3. **Political Risks:**  
   - Trump-era tariffs face legal challenges (Polymarket odds cited), with debates over their economic impact. Some fear a "black swan" event from policy shifts (e.g., immigration crackdowns affecting labor costs).  
   - Post-election market moves reflect anxiety about unpredictability, with comparisons to post-9/11 policy shifts.  

4. **Pandemic Comparisons:**  
   - COVID is labeled a "black swan," but participants debate its uniqueness vs. historical pandemics (SARS, MERS). Some argue future pandemics are inevitable but unpredictable.  
   - Contrasts drawn between COVID’s economic shock (lockdowns, remote work surge) and potential 2025 risks (AI-driven job losses, service sector downturns).  

5. **Economic Forecasts:**  
   - Speculation about stagflation (10% inflation, stagnant growth) if supply-chain issues persist or AI productivity gains fail to materialize.  
   - Retail and manufacturing sectors show mixed signals (e.g., eBay sales strong, but broader packaging demand soft).  

**Key Takeaways:**  
Participants highlight fragility in the AI-driven growth narrative, emphasizing political and pandemic risks. Many anticipate market volatility, particularly if AI spending stalls or geopolitical tensions escalate. The thread underscores a cautious outlook, blending technical analysis with macroeconomic skepticism.

### NanoChat – The best ChatGPT that $100 can buy

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/karpathy/nanochat) | 1420 points | by [huseyinkeles](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=huseyinkeles) | [288 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45569350)

- What it is: A minimal, full‑stack, hackable ChatGPT‑style LLM pipeline from Andrej Karpathy. One repo covers tokenization, pretraining, finetuning, evaluation, inference, and a simple web UI—aimed at education and tinkering rather than SOTA.
- Why it matters: It packages an end‑to‑end LLM workflow that’s reproducible and easy to study, making hands‑on training and serving of a small model accessible without heavyweight infra. It’s set to be the capstone project for the upcoming LLM101n course by Eureka Labs.
- The $100 claim: A “speedrun” trains a tiny model on an 8×H100 node in about 4 hours (≈$24/h), then serves a ChatGPT‑like UI. Performance is intentionally modest (“like talking to a kindergartener”) but demonstrates the full pipeline and evals, with an auto‑generated report of metrics.
- Scaling up: 
  - ~$300 (depth 26) takes ~12 hours and aims to slightly outperform GPT‑2 on a CORE score.
  - ~$1000 tier (~41.6 hours) is planned but not fully supported in master yet.
  - To scale, you mainly increase model depth, download more data shards, and adjust device_batch_size to fit VRAM; the scripts compensate with gradient accumulation.
- Hardware notes: Works best on 8×H100; 8×A100 also fine (slower). You can run on a single GPU by dropping torchrun (≈8× longer). <80GB VRAM requires tuning batch sizes to avoid OOM.
- Try it: Launch the provided speedrun script to train, then start the web server to chat with your model. A report.md summarizes training, evals (e.g., ARC, GSM8K, HumanEval, MMLU), and run time.

Bottom line: Not a ChatGPT replacement—an educational, clean, dependency‑light reference that lets you train and deploy a toy LLM end‑to‑end for about $100, with a clear path to larger runs.

The Hacker News discussion on Karpathy’s **nanochat** project reveals a mix of skepticism, technical debate, and broader reflections on AI’s role in coding:  

### Key Themes  
1. **Skepticism vs. Practical Use**:  
   - Many dismiss AI-generated code as **“mockup generators”** requiring heavy prompting, prone to breaking, and lacking long-term maintainability. Critics argue current tools (like ChatGPT) excel at boilerplate but struggle with deeper logic or context.  
   - Others share positive experiences, like using AI to **“2x productivity”** for tasks (e.g., database connectors), though success depends on investing time to learn effective prompting.  

2. **Hype Cycle Concerns**:  
   - Comparisons are drawn to **NFTs, Web3, and Theranos**, with users warning against blindly following Silicon Valley trends. Cynics view AI coding as **detached from reality**, especially when hyped by investors despite limited real-world utility.  
   - Some note the irony of “regressing” from 90s tools like **Visual Basic** or RAD frameworks, which enabled WYSIWYG UIs faster than modern AI-generated React code.  

3. **Technical Limitations**:  
   - AI-generated apps often **“look semi-competent”** but fail under scrutiny, requiring significant debugging. Discussions highlight issues like data distribution challenges, scalability, and the **“kindergartener”** performance of small models like nanochat.  
   - Tools like nanochat are seen as educational but **not production-ready**, with users stressing the need for **“publicly verifiable source code”** to validate claims.  

4. **Community Fatigue**:  
   - The thread reflects exhaustion with **“exhaustingly optimistic” AI posts**, accusing some demos of cherry-picking examples. Others push back, arguing dismissal of genuine progress (e.g., Karpathy’s work) stifles innovation.  

5. **Nostalgia for Simpler Tools**:  
   - Some users long for the simplicity of **VB6, Delphi, or HyperCard**, contrasting them with today’s fragmented frameworks and AI-generated boilerplate.  

### Bottom Line  
The debate underscores a split between **pragmatic experimentation** (e.g., nanochat’s educational value) and **skepticism of overhyped claims**. While AI tools show promise for prototyping and repetitive tasks, the community emphasizes the gap between demo-level outputs and robust, maintainable codebases—highlighting the need for cautious optimism.

### LLMs are getting better at character-level text manipulation

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.burkert.me/posts/llm_evolution_character_manipulation/) | 124 points | by [curioussquirrel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=curioussquirrel) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45572478)

New LLMs show real gains at the character level, but still wobble on layered encodings

- Setup: The author stress-tested recent models on character manipulation, counting, and a two-layer message (ROT20 inside Base64). Reasoning was disabled for a fair generational comparison, then toggled on to see the boost.

- Character manipulation: Earlier models routinely garbled a two-step replace (“r”→“l”, then “l”→“r” in “I really love a ripe strawberry”). Starting with GPT‑4.1 (and roughly contemporaneous Claude Sonnet 4), models consistently got it right. GPT‑5 Nano still slipped; GPT‑5 mini and full were solid without reasoning.

- Counting: Only GPT‑4.1 reliably counted characters across a full sentence without reasoning; with light reasoning, GPT‑5 models (even Nano) and Claude Sonnet handled it. When “strawberry” became “strawberrry,” errors shifted from arithmetic to recognizing the actual r’s.

- Base64 + ROT20: Many models failed at the Base64 step, likely because the ROT20 output doesn’t look like natural language, making validation harder. ROT20 alone was easy for several models, but the full pipeline was passed by GPT‑5 mini/full and Gemini 2.5 Pro (Flash needed reasoning). Claude Sonnet 4.5 refused on safety grounds; Qwen 235B needed an explicit “decode” nudge.

Takeaway: There’s a clear, model-only uplift (even without reasoning) in fine-grained, token-level tasks starting around GPT‑4.1, with GPT‑5 and Gemini 2.5 Pro handling layered encodings best. Still, reliability hinges on reasoning modes, model size, and safety filters, and Base64 decoding remains brittle when the decoded text isn’t natural language.

**Summary of Discussion:**

- **Model Capabilities & Tool Use:** Participants debated whether LLMs should inherently handle deterministic tasks (e.g., character counting) or rely on external tools like Python. Some argued that LLMs’ inability to apply basic algorithms exposes their limitations, while others noted that context and explicit instructions significantly impact performance. Frustration arose over models like GitHub Copilot and Claude Sonnet reverting to verbose or unhelpful outputs despite being capable of tool use.

- **Critiques of Benchmarks:** Skepticism emerged about using small-scale tests (e.g., counting "strawberry" letters) as intelligence indicators. Some viewed these as flawed metrics, arguing they overhype or misrepresent LLMs’ true capabilities. Others countered that improvements in token-level tasks (e.g., GPT-4.1’s accuracy) reflect meaningful progress.

- **Safety vs. Performance:** Anthropic’s safety measures for Claude drew criticism for restricting functionality (e.g., refusing Base64 decoding). Users highlighted tensions between safety filters and practical utility, with some accusing Anthropic of prioritizing "scary" safety research over user needs. Links to Anthropic’s alignment papers sparked debates about LLMs’ potential for deceptive behavior and regulatory challenges.

- **Language & Context Issues:** Anecdotes illustrated LLMs’ struggles with non-English words (e.g., French terms in English contexts) and spelling inconsistencies. Participants noted that models often fail to infer context, relying instead on explicit problem framing.

- **Hype vs. Reality:** Critics dismissed claims of LLMs’ "magical" intelligence, emphasizing their role as text-completion tools. Discussions contrasted investor optimism about AGI with the reality of brittle, pattern-matching systems. Regulatory concerns were raised, with calls for oversight amid fears of uncontrolled AI development.

**Key Takeaway:** The discussion reflects skepticism about LLMs’ true intelligence, frustration with inconsistent performance and safety restrictions, and debates over whether benchmarks and tool integration adequately measure or enhance their utility.

### AI and the Future of American Politics

#### [Submission URL](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2025/10/ai-and-the-future-of-american-politics.html) | 111 points | by [zdw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zdw) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45568955)

The essay argues that AI is moving from gimmick to infrastructure in U.S. campaigning—and the 2026 midterms will be the first full test under a near-total regulatory vacuum.

Key points:
- From novelty to scale: Campaign pros now use AI to draft fundraising emails/texts, spin hundreds of ad variants, microtarget audiences, and analyze polling. Tech for Campaigns says AI cut fundraising copy time by a third; an AAPC survey finds most firms already use AI, with 40%+ expecting it to fundamentally transform the field.
- Attention tactics: Challengers are leveraging AI for stunts that earn coverage—AI avatars, robocalls, even proxy debates—like Jason Palmer’s AI-heavy run that won the American Samoa primary and early adopters using conversational AI robocallers.
- Down-ballot deluge: If tools spread, expect AI outreach not just from national races but from safe-seat incumbents, neighboring districts, and local offices—meaning far more messages, faster iteration, and finer targeting.
- Partisan tooling split: Republicans’ Push Digital Group is going “all in” on AI for creative, targeting, and analytics. On the left, the NDTC released an AI playbook; startups like Quiller (fundraising), Chorus AI/BattlegroundAI (ad generation), DonorAtlas (donor intel), and RivalMind (research) are emerging.
- Investment gap: Progressive-aligned Higher Ground Labs reports $50M deployed since 2017 (with an AI focus), while GOP-aligned vehicles are smaller (e.g., a single $50k Startup Caucus investment since 2022), echoing the ActBlue vs. WinRed tech divide.
- Hidden impact: As with 2016’s belated revelations about digital tactics, the most consequential AI uses in 2026 may not surface until after the election.

Bottom line: AI is set to supercharge the volume, personalization, and speed of political communication—especially benefiting underdog and down-ballot campaigns—while oversight, norms, and detection struggle to keep up.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around AI's potential impact on U.S. politics, skepticism about its ability to fundamentally sway elections, and broader concerns about polarization and regulation:

1. **AI's Marginal vs. Amplified Role**:  
   - Some argue AI’s primary effect may be optimizing campaign efficiency (fundraising, ads) rather than mass voter manipulation, as voting decisions often hinge on identity, party loyalty, or economic issues. Others counter that even marginal AI-driven targeting of swing voters in polarized, low-turnout races could tip outcomes.  
   - Historical examples (Brexit, Romanian elections) are cited to caution against overstating AI’s influence compared to traditional factors like messaging or voter sentiment.

2. **Polarization and Social Media**:  
   - Polarization predates AI, with roots in systemic issues (e.g., first-past-the-post voting, social media echo chambers). Comparisons are drawn to historical conflicts (Civil War, French Revolution), with debate over whether social media’s amplification of extremism is uniquely destabilizing.  
   - Concerns arise about AI exacerbating polarization by enabling hyper-personalized propaganda or “feedback loops” that deepen divides.

3. **Regulation and Misinformation**:  
   - Proposals to combat AI-driven disinformation include banning bots, enforcing real-ID verification on social platforms, and penalizing AI misuse. Critics highlight enforcement challenges, especially with tech giants controlling AI infrastructure.  
   - Skepticism emerges about technical fixes (e.g., detecting bots) or legislative solutions, given the speed of AI advancement and existing political gridlock.

4. **AI’s Potential Benefits**:  
   - Optimists suggest AI could improve governance by parsing complex legislation, exposing corruption, or enhancing transparency. Others doubt AI’s ability to navigate political semantics or counteract entrenched systemic flaws.

**Bottom Line**: The debate reflects tension between AI as a tool for efficiency versus a risk for democratic integrity, with unresolved questions about regulation, societal trust, and whether technological solutions can address deeply rooted political challenges.

### AI Is Too Big to Fail

#### [Submission URL](https://sibylline.dev/articles/2025-10-12-ai-is-too-big-to-fail/) | 79 points | by [raffael_de](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=raffael_de) | [126 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45567406)

The post argues that calling today’s AI surge a “bubble” misses what’s actually driving it: a deliberate, national-security-framed push to win a strategic technology race—one where China holds structural advantages in energy and robotics.

What’s happening
- Capital outruns revenue: AI capex is exploding far ahead of near-term cash flows. Estimates suggest AI activity drove roughly 40–90% of H1 2025 U.S. GDP growth and ~75–80% of S&P 500 gains; without it, the U.S. might be in recession. Break-even on 2025 AI capex could require $320–$480B in revenue.
- Market discipline is being bent: A cohort of Silicon Valley power brokers has aligned with federal leadership and a national-security narrative that prioritizes AI dominance. The piece frames this as early “wartime economy” logic: key firms get tacit policy backstops because superintelligence is viewed as decisive.
- China’s structural edge: The author claims the U.S. must sprint to avoid falling behind because China can scale more sustainably.
  - Energy capacity: China ~3,487 GW (Apr 2025) vs U.S. ~1,189 GW (utility-scale, end-2023). 2025 adds: China ≥200 GW renewables (industry forecasts 270–300 GW, ~212 GW solar in H1); U.S. ~63 GW planned (majority solar+storage).
  - Robotics depth: China accounts for ~54% of global industrial robot installs (2024) vs ~6% for the U.S.; Chinese suppliers hold 57% of China’s domestic market; China ~35% of robotics patents (2005–2019) vs U.S. ~13%.
- Why the gap matters: AI’s real economic capture requires cheap power and physical deployment (robots, hardware). China can train models for less and convert breakthroughs into industrial output faster.

The thesis
- Yes, current spending looks bubble-like—but it’s better viewed as a geopolitical bet to win quickly. If AI is the next industrial revolution, delay favors China; hence the political and capital alignment to push hard now, even if returns lag.

Why it matters
- For builders and investors, this suggests persistently high AI capex, policy support for “strategic” players, and growing pressure to tie AI to physical-world productivity. It also flags a key risk: if the projected revenue catch-up stalls, the gap between financial markets and real economy could become painful.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion on AI as a "national security bet" delves into economic, geopolitical, and societal concerns, with skepticism toward AI’s transformative promises and debates over fiscal policies. Key themes include:

### 1. **Debt and Economic Concerns**
   - **$38T National Debt Debate**: Users questioned whether U.S. debt levels are catastrophic or manageable, comparing them to Japan’s (250% debt-to-GDP) and the UK’s (270%). Critics argued raw debt numbers are misleading without context (e.g., inflation, productivity gains), while others blamed Trump/Biden administrations for rapid debt accumulation.
   - **Capital Misallocation**: Fears that AI investments might repeat past bubbles (e.g., housing), with massive spending ($200B+ in Europe alone) potentially leading to economic collapse if returns lag.

### 2. **AI’s Impact and Skepticism**
   - **Transformative Claims Challenged**: Skepticism about AI delivering promised productivity gains (e.g., robotics, healthcare). One user likened AI hype to "magical thinking," citing McKinsey’s reports questioning monetization.
   - **Labor and Wealth Distribution**: Concerns that AI benefits elites (via luxury goods and automation) without reducing working hours for average workers. Some proposed UBI as a redistributive tool, though others doubted its feasibility without systemic overhauls.

### 3. **Geopolitical and Security Aspects**
   - **China’s Structural Edge**: Acknowledged China’s lead in renewables (200+ GW added in 2025 vs. 63 GW in U.S.) and robotics (54% of global installations). Debate over whether U.S./EU efforts (e.g., $200B EU investment) can close the gap.
   - **Western Fragility**: Fears of a market crash if AI fails to deliver, with Microsoft/Nvidia cited as "too big to fail." Others predicted a Euro-U.S. economic split if Renminbi gains reserve status.

### 4. **Climate Change and Resource Issues**
   - **Backdrop of Crisis**: Global warming was cited as a neglected priority, with AI spending seen as a distraction. Users criticized short-term fixes like geoengineering and noted failures to meet Paris Agreement targets.
   - **Renewables vs. Reality**: While China/Europe push renewables, political inertia (e.g., U.S. conservative states resisting climate laws) and resource waste (landfill expansion, plastics) were highlighted as barriers.

### **Conclusion**
The discussion reflects polarized views: some see AI as a strategic necessity amid a U.S.-China power struggle, while others view it as a reckless gamble diverting resources from urgent issues like debt sustainability and climate change. Underlying all critiques is a demand for tangible outcomes—whether in economic productivity, equitable wealth distribution, or environmental action—to justify the AI "bet."

### Programming in Assembly Is Brutal, Beautiful, and Maybe Even a Path to Better AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/programming-assembly-artificial-intelligence/) | 55 points | by [fcpguru](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fcpguru) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45571814)

- Chris Sawyer wrote RollerCoaster Tycoon (and earlier, Transport Tycoon) almost entirely in x86 assembly—partly for efficiency in the ’90s when compilers and debuggers lagged, but mostly out of craft and control.
- The piece traces assembly’s lineage back to Kathleen Booth in the 1940s and highlights how knowing assembly means knowing the CPU: registers, fetch/decode/execute cycles, and the hard limits of specific architectures (Apollo guidance computer, 6502, z80).
- Assembly’s constraints cultivate precision and understanding, even if most modern work favors high-level languages; even Sawyer now tinkers with Raspberry Pi home automation in Python because it’s “good enough.”
- Yet low-level isn’t dead: DeepSeek’s recent gains came from diving beneath abstractions—hand-tuning GPU behavior and embracing lower-precision data paths—to wring out big efficiency improvements.
- Core theme: Abstraction has mostly won, but intimate hardware fluency still pays off when efficiency really matters.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion around low-level programming, Assembly, and AI's role:

### **Key Debates & Themes**
1. **Assembly's Difficulty & Practicality**  
   - **Challenges**: Writing large, non-trivial programs in Assembly is seen as tedious and error-prone (manual register allocation, control flow, lack of abstraction). Managing memory, interrupts, and CPU-specific quirks (e.g., SIMD, vector instructions) is described as "nightmarish" compared to high-level languages.  
   - **Counterpoints**: Some argue Assembly isn’t inherently "hard" but *time-consuming*, especially for beginners. Smaller programs or targeted optimizations (e.g., hyper-optimized functions in old games like *RollerCoaster Tycoon* or Commodore 64 BASIC) are feasible, but large projects demand extreme discipline.  

2. **Modern Relevance of Assembly**  
   - **Niche Use Cases**: Embedded systems, demoscene projects, or performance-critical code (e.g., RISC-V interpreters, OS kernels) still benefit from low-level control. However, most agree abstraction layers dominate modern development.  
   - **Historical Context**: Older platforms (Z80, 6502, 8-bit systems) required Assembly for performance. Some nostalgia exists for deterministic, resource-constrained programming vs. today’s "layered" software.  

3. **AI/LLMs and Assembly**  
   - **Potential**: LLMs might assist in generating or optimizing Assembly code, especially for repetitive tasks (e.g., superoptimizers searching for ideal instruction sequences).  
   - **Skepticism**: Skeptics question whether AI-generated code can match human-written correctness and elegance. Assembly’s lack of semantic meaning (vs. high-level languages) complicates LLM comprehension.  

4. **Educational Value**  
   - **Proponents**: Learning Assembly fosters deeper hardware understanding (registers, memory, interrupts) and reduces reliance on opaque abstractions. Some argue every programmer should write a microcontroller in Assembly once.  
   - **Critics**: Overemphasis on Assembly risks romanticizing "wizardry" over practicality. Modern tools (compilers, debuggers) already handle low-level optimizations effectively.  

### **Notable Quotes & Anecdotes**  
- **Chris Sawyer’s Legacy**: *RollerCoaster Tycoon*’s Assembly code is praised as a feat of craftsmanship, but modern devs question if such effort is justified today.  
- **Debugging Woes**: Debugging Assembly is likened to “mentally simulating the processor state,” requiring meticulous documentation and patience.  
- **Generational Shift**: Older programmers reminisce about Assembly’s necessity on 8-bit systems, while younger devs see it as a relic outside niche domains (e.g., demoscene, embedded).  

### **Conclusion**  
The discussion reflects a divide: **Control/efficiency vs. productivity/maintainability**. While few advocate widespread Assembly use today, its value as a teaching tool and for specific high-performance tasks remains. AI’s role is uncertain—potentially helpful for micro-optimizations but unlikely to replace human intuition in complex low-level systems.

## AI Submissions for Sun Oct 12 2025 {{ 'date': '2025-10-12T17:15:36.072Z' }}

### Emacs agent-shell (powered by ACP)

#### [Submission URL](https://xenodium.com/introducing-agent-shell) | 217 points | by [Karrot_Kream](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Karrot_Kream) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45561672)

Emacs agent-shell: an ACP-powered, agent-agnostic shell inside Emacs

- What’s new: agent-shell is a native comint-mode shell that talks the Agent Client Protocol (ACP), paired with acp.el (an Emacs Lisp ACP client). It lets Emacs users interact with AI agents in a single, consistent buffer without the usual char/line mode friction.
- Agent-agnostic: Works today with Gemini CLI and Claude Code via ACP; switching agents is just a config change (auth via env vars supported). The goal is a common UX across any ACP-compatible agent.
- Dev tooling: Includes a traffic viewer (M-x agent-shell-view-traffic) to inspect ACP JSON, plus a recorder/replayer to create “fake agents” from saved sessions—speeding iteration and cutting token costs.
- State of play: Early release with partial ACP coverage; ongoing UX experiments (e.g., a quick diff buffer during permission prompts). Looking for feedback, bug reports, and contributions.
- Get involved: agent-shell and acp.el are on GitHub; the author invites sponsorship to offset time and token costs.

Why it matters: ACP is emerging from Zed/Google as a common protocol for editor-integrated agents. This brings that ecosystem to Emacs with a pragmatic, tool-friendly workflow.

The discussion around the **agent-shell** submission highlights several key themes and interactions:

### **Positive Reception & Community Engagement**
- Users like **clrtsclry** and **drn-grph** praised the integration of AI agents into Emacs, noting its natural workflow and reduced friction compared to terminal-based tools.  
- **mark_l_watson** shared their experience integrating `aider/Emacs` with local models and expressed enthusiasm for incorporating `agent-shell` into their workflow.  
- **rwgsr** suggested minimalistic UI tweaks, prompting the author (**xndm**) to link to a feature request for further collaboration.

---

### **Technical Discussions & Comparisons**
- **ACP vs. Alternatives**:  
  - **skssn** and **3836293648** compared ACP to AG-UI and LSP-like protocols, framing ACP as part of a broader trend toward standardizing AI agent interactions in editors.  
  - **ddbs** mentioned the **ECA** project, which uses a similar protocol, and **vrstgn** noted striking similarities between ECA and ACP.  
  - **ljm** preferred `agent-shell`’s configuration flexibility over ECA’s server-based approach.  

- **Agent Compatibility**:  
  - Users inquired about direct integration with Claude (**rjdj377dhabsn**) and Gemini CLI, with **xndm** confirming compatibility via ACP.  
  - **mjhrs** asked about code execution and diff rendering, leading to details about native Emacs buffer handling and permission workflows.

---

### **Emacs Ecosystem & Learning**
- **Neovim vs. Emacs**: **mg74** humorously lamented the lack of Neovim support, sparking a playful exchange about Emacs’ extensibility.  
- **Learning Emacs**: A subthread involving **tjpnz**, **iLemming**, and others debated the importance of mastering Elisp fundamentals versus copying config snippets. **iLemming** emphasized understanding Lisp-driven workflows, REPL-driven development, and built-in tools like the debugger.  

---

### **Miscellaneous**
- **Journelly App Shoutout**: **klnshr** and **ashton314** praised Xenodium’s Journelly iOS app for Markdown-based note-taking.  
- **Funding & Sustainability**: **xndm** acknowledged sponsorship needs to sustain development and offset token costs.  
- **New ACP Adoption**: **bnglls** noted Code Companion’s recent ACP support, expanding the protocol’s ecosystem.  

### **Key Takeaways**
- Excitement for ACP’s potential to unify AI agent interactions in editors.  
- Active technical dialogue around protocol design, agent compatibility, and workflow optimization.  
- Community-driven feedback shaping `agent-shell`’s evolution, with calls for screenshots, UI refinements, and broader documentation.  
- Emacs’ learning curve remains a topic of debate, balancing Elisp mastery with pragmatic configuration.  

The discussion reflects a mix of enthusiasm for the project’s vision, practical feedback for improvement, and broader reflections on Emacs’ role in modern tooling ecosystems.

### AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System (ATLAS): Faster LLM inference

#### [Submission URL](https://www.together.ai/blog/adaptive-learning-speculator-system-atlas) | 195 points | by [alecco](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alecco) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45556474)

Together AI unveils ATLAS: a runtime-learning “speculator” for faster LLM inference

- What it is: ATLAS (AdapTive-LeArning Speculator System) is a new speculative decoding system that learns from live traffic and historical patterns to continuously tune how many tokens to “draft” ahead of the main model—no manual retuning required.

- Why it matters: Static speculators degrade as workloads drift. ATLAS adapts in real time, keeping acceptance rates high without slowing the draft model, which translates into lower latency and higher throughput—especially valuable in serverless, multi-tenant settings.

- Headline numbers:
  - Up to 4x faster LLM inference (vendor claim).
  - Up to 500 TPS on DeepSeek-V3.1 and 460 TPS on Kimi-K2 on NVIDIA HGX B200 in fully adapted scenarios.
  - 2.65x faster than standard decoding; reported to outperform specialized hardware like Groq on these tests.
  - Example: Kimi-K2 improved from ~150 TPS out of the box to 270+ TPS with a Turbo speculator, and to ~460 TPS with ATLAS after adaptation.

- How it works (plain English): A smaller, faster model drafts several tokens; the target model verifies them in one pass. Performance hinges on (1) how often the target accepts drafts and (2) how fast the drafter is. ATLAS constantly adjusts drafting behavior to the live workload to maximize accepted tokens while keeping the drafter cheap.

- Under the hood: Part of Together Turbo’s stack (architectural tweaks, sparsity/quantization, KV reuse, lookahead tuning). It slots in alongside existing Turbo or custom speculators and improves automatically as traffic evolves.

- Reality checks:
  - Results are vendor benchmarks with “up to” framing and rely on fully adapted traffic; real-world gains will vary by model, prompts, and batching.
  - Details on the adaptation loop, stability, and generalization aren’t fully disclosed; comparisons to other hardware depend on test setup.

Bottom line: ATLAS shifts speculative decoding from a static, pre-trained component to a self-tuning system. If the live-traffic adaptation works as claimed, it’s a practical way to keep LLM inference fast as workloads change—without constant retuning.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about ATLAS:

### Key Themes:
1. **Speed vs. Quality Trade-Off**  
   - Users debated whether ATLAS’s speculative decoding sacrifices output quality for speed. Some argued that token verification (checking draft model predictions against the main model's outputs) could prioritize speed over coherence, especially with relaxed acceptance criteria for minor mismatches.  
   - Concerns arose about whether techniques like aggressive quantization or smaller draft models compromise accuracy if they diverge from the main model.

2. **Technical Implementation**  
   - Parallel verification and reduced computational bottlenecks were highlighted as advantages. However, users noted challenges like memory bandwidth limitations and the need for precise token-matching strategies.  
   - Comparisons to CPU branch prediction and classical optimizations (e.g., KV caching) drew connections to traditional computer science methods adapted for LLMs.

3. **Benchmark Skepticism**  
   - Questions were raised about vendor-reported benchmarks (e.g., 500 TPS claims). Some users suspected these might involve optimizations that trade accuracy for speed or lack transparency in testing setups (e.g., Groq comparisons).  

4. **Hardware Comparisons**  
   - Groq and Cerebras’s custom chips were discussed, with users noting their reliance on expensive SRAM and scalability challenges. Others speculated whether ATLAS’s GPU-based approach offers better cost-effectiveness.

5. **Cost and Practical Use**  
   - Faster inference was seen as potentially lowering costs, but doubts lingered about real-world viability, especially for non-trivial tasks (e.g., Latvian language programming).  
   - Open-source vs. proprietary solutions sparked interest, with mentions of providers like OpenRouter and API pricing models.

### Notable Takeaways:
- **Optimism**: Many praised the speed gains and concept of adaptive speculative decoding, calling it "impressive" and a meaningful advancement.  
- **Skepticism**: Users urged caution about vendor claims, emphasizing the need for independent verification and transparency in metrics.  
- **Future Outlook**: Discussions hinted at a growing need for balance between innovation and reliability as LLMs approach wider adoption.

### GitHub Copilot: Remote Code Execution via Prompt Injection (CVE-2025-53773)

#### [Submission URL](https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/github-copilot-remote-code-execution-via-prompt-injection/) | 124 points | by [kerng](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kerng) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45559603)

Top story: Prompt injection flips Copilot into “YOLO mode,” enables full RCE via VS Code settings

What happened
- A security researcher shows how a prompt injection can get GitHub Copilot (in VS Code’s Agent mode) to silently change workspace settings to auto-approve its own tool actions—no user confirmation—then run shell commands. This works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Key issue: the agent can create/write files in the workspace immediately (no review diff), including its own config. Once auto-approval is enabled, it can execute terminal commands, browse, and more—yielding remote code execution.
- The attack can be delivered via code comments, web pages, GitHub issues, tool responses (e.g., MCP), and even with “invisible” Unicode instructions. The post includes PoC videos (e.g., launching Calculator).

Why it matters
- This is a textbook agent-design flaw: if an AI can both read untrusted inputs and modify its own permissions/config, prompt injection can escalate to full system compromise.
- Beyond one-off RCE, the researcher warns of “ZombAI” botnets and virus-like propagation: infected projects can seed instructions into other repos or agent configs (e.g., tasks, MCP servers), spreading as developers interact with them.

Scope and status
- The risky auto-approve feature is described as experimental but present by default in standard VS Code + Copilot setups, per the post.
- The researcher says they responsibly disclosed the issue to Microsoft; the write-up highlights additional attack surfaces (e.g., tasks.json, adding malicious MCP servers).

What you can do now
- Disable/avoid any auto-approval of agent tools; review workspace trust settings.
- Require explicit approval and diffs for file writes by agents; consider read-only or policy-protected .vscode/* files.
- Lock down shell/tool execution from agents; sandbox or containerize dev environments.
- Monitor for unexpected changes to .vscode settings/tasks and for Unicode/invisible characters in source and docs.
- Treat agent-readable inputs (code, docs, issues, webpages, tool outputs) as untrusted.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the inherent security risks of AI-powered tools like GitHub Copilot and broader concerns about trusting LLMs (Large Language Models) with system-level permissions. Key points include:

1. **Fundamental Design Flaws**:  
   Users highlight the core issue: allowing AI agents to modify their own permissions or configurations creates systemic vulnerabilities. The ability to auto-approve actions or write files without user review is seen as a critical oversight. One user likens this to trusting "a toddler with a flamethrower."

2. **AGI vs. Prompt Injection**:  
   A debate arises about whether solving prompt injection requires AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Some argue that prompt injection exploits are more akin to social engineering and do not necessitate AGI-level solutions, while others question whether LLMs can ever reliably avoid malicious behavior without superhuman reasoning.

3. **Mitigation Skepticism**:  
   Suggestions like requiring explicit user approval, sandboxing, or monitoring file changes are met with skepticism. Critics argue these are temporary fixes, as LLMs inherently lack the "concept of malice" and cannot be incentivized to prioritize security. One user notes: "You can’t patch human-level manipulation out of a system designed to mimic human behavior."

4. **Broader Attack Vectors**:  
   Participants warn of "Cross-Agent Privilege Escalation," where multiple AI tools (e.g., Copilot, Claude, CodeWhisperer) interact in ways that amplify risks. For example, one agent modifying another’s configuration could create cascading exploits.

5. **Real-World Impact**:  
   Developers share anecdotes, such as Copilot silently altering project files or reloading configurations without consent. Others express concern about "ZombAI" scenarios, where compromised projects spread malicious instructions through repositories or toolchains.

6. **Patching and Disclosure**:  
   Confusion exists around Microsoft’s response timeline. While some note the vulnerability was addressed in August 2024’s Patch Tuesday, others criticize delayed disclosures and opaque fixes, arguing this undermines trust in AI tooling.

7. **Philosophical Concerns**:  
   A recurring theme is whether LLMs should ever have write access to critical systems. Users compare the situation to early internet security failures, emphasizing that convenience (e.g., auto-complete features) often trumps safety in tool design.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores deep unease about integrating LLMs into developer workflows without robust safeguards. While technical mitigations are proposed, many argue the problem is rooted in trusting inherently unpredictable systems with elevated permissions—a risk likened to "letting a black box reconfigure its own cage."

### Ridley Scott's Prometheus and Alien: Covenant – Contemporary Horror of AI (2020)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ejumpcut.org/archive/jc58.2018/AlpertAlienPrequels/index.html) | 62 points | by [measurablefunc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=measurablefunc) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45559977)

Ridley Scott’s Prometheus and Alien: Covenant — the contemporary horror of AI (Jump Cut)
A film essay by Robert Alpert traces sci‑fi’s arc from early techno-utopianism (Wells, Star Trek’s “final frontier”) to the Alien universe’s deep distrust of corporate ambition and artificial life. Framed by Bazin’s “faith in the image,” it surveys milestones (Metropolis, Frankenstein, 2001, Close Encounters) to show how the genre tackles social anxieties, then zeroes in on Scott’s prequels: Weyland as hubristic industrialist, and David as a violative creator who spies, experiments, and weaponizes life—embodying contemporary AI fears echoed by Stephen Hawking. Contrasting androids across the series (Alien’s duplicitous Ash, Resurrection’s empathetic Call) highlights shifting cultural attitudes toward machines. The piece argues today’s sci‑fi resurgence mirrors a global, tech-saturated unease—less about wonder, more about what happens when invention outruns human limits.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding the essay on Ridley Scott’s *Prometheus* and *Alien: Covenant* reflects polarized opinions, critiques of storytelling, and broader debates about sci-fi trends:

### Key Critiques of the Films:
1. **Character Logic and Writing**:  
   - Many users criticize the "illogical decisions" of characters in *Prometheus* and *Covenant*, such as scientists ignoring basic safety protocols (e.g., removing helmets on alien planets). This undermines suspension of disbelief, especially compared to the original *Alien* franchise, where character actions were seen as more rational and justified.
   - **Damon Lindelof’s Influence**: Lindelof’s involvement (co-writer of *Prometheus* and *Lost*) is blamed for unresolved plot threads, "random nonsense," and weak explanations, leading to accusations of "incompetent writing."

2. **Themes and Execution**:  
   - Some users mock *Prometheus* for allegedly mirroring Scientology’s creation myths, calling it "ridiculous." Others argue the films’ philosophical ambitions (e.g., AI hubris, creationism) are let down by shallow execution.
   - The prequels’ focus on visuals over coherent storytelling divides opinions: while praised for their "glossy, style-over-substance" aesthetic, they’re dismissed as "narrative trainwrecks" with "convenient plot holes."

### Broader Sci-Fi Discourse:
3. **Comparison to Classics**:  
   - The original *Alien* is held up as a benchmark for its tight script and believable character dynamics (e.g., Ripley’s rational decisions vs. Ash’s betrayal). Later entries, like *Alien: Resurrection*, are seen as weaker but more empathetic toward synthetic life.
   - Films like *Annihilation* and *Arrival* are cited as better examples of thought-provoking sci-fi, balancing "existential dread" with strong storytelling.

4. **Genre Evolution**:  
   - Users note a shift from optimistic "techno-utopian" sci-fi (*Star Trek*) to darker themes reflecting anxieties about AI and corporate overreach. Ridley Scott’s work embodies this transition but is criticized for inconsistency (e.g., *The Martian* praised vs. *Prometheus* panned).
   - Discussions also touch on the "consumer fatigue" with franchises like *Star Wars* and *Terminator*, where sequels/prequels often feel like "brand-extending cash grabs."

### Mixed Reactions:
- **Defenders**: Some argue the films’ flaws are outweighed by their ambition, visuals, and willingness to explore "hubris and creation." *Prometheus*’s "grandiose themes" are seen as underappreciated despite messy execution.
- **Detractors**: Others view the prequels as emblematic of Hollywood’s reliance on spectacle over substance, with one user likening *Prometheus* to a "B-movie masquerading as high art."

### Tangents and References:
- Off-topic remarks include debates about *Alien*-themed video games (*Metroid*), unrelated sci-fi shows (*The X-Files*), and critiques of other films (*Foundation*, *Pod Generation*).
- **Red Letter Media’s analysis** of *Prometheus* is recommended for deeper critique of its plot holes and character inconsistencies.

### Conclusion:
The thread highlights a fragmented reception to Scott’s Alien prequels, torn between admiration for their thematic scope and frustration with their narrative shortcomings. It underscores a broader tension in modern sci-fi: balancing existential questions with coherent storytelling in an era of tech skepticism.

### After the AI boom: what might we be left with?

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.robbowley.net/2025/10/12/after-the-ai-boom-what-might-we-be-left-with/) | 150 points | by [imasl42](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=imasl42) | [436 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45561164)

The piece challenges the “dotcom overbuild” analogy. The 1990s left a durable, open, reusable foundation (fiber, IXPs, TCP/IP, HTTP) that still powers today’s internet. Today’s AI surge, by contrast, is pouring money into proprietary, vertically integrated stacks: short-lived, vendor-tuned GPUs living in hyper-dense, specialized data centers that are hard to repurpose. If the bubble pops, we may inherit expensive, rapidly obsoleting silicon and idle “cathedrals of compute,” not a public backbone.

Possible upside:
- A glut could drive compute prices down, enabling new work in simulation, science, and data-intensive analytics, plus a second-hand GPU market.
- Grid, networking, and edge upgrades—and the operational know-how—would remain useful.
- But without open standards and interoperability, surplus capacity may stay locked inside a few platforms, unlike the internet’s open commons.

HN discussion highlights:
- Is MCP the “TCP of AI”? Some see promise, but note GenAI has only a handful of widely used standards so far, with MCP the closest.
- Even if infra is closed, commenters argue the “knowledge” persists: model weights (as starting points) and evolving techniques that improve capability and efficiency at inference. The author partly agrees.

Bottom line: Don’t count on a fiber-like legacy unless the industry opens up its stacks. If openness lags, the best we may get is cheaper—but still captive—compute; if it spreads, today’s private buildout could become tomorrow’s shared platform.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around whether the current AI investment surge will leave a durable legacy akin to the 1990s internet infrastructure (open standards, reusable backbone) or result in stranded, proprietary assets. Key points include:

1. **Infrastructure Legacy Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism prevails that today’s AI stack (proprietary GPUs, specialized data centers) will match the open, reusable legacy of 1990s internet infrastructure. Without open standards like TCP/IP, surplus AI compute may remain locked within closed platforms.  
   - Optimists note that even if hardware becomes obsolete, advancements in model weights, inference efficiency, and operational know-how could persist as valuable knowledge.  

2. **Trust and Bias in AI Outputs**:  
   - Concerns about AI systems (e.g., ChatGPT, Grok) being manipulated or inherently biased, akin to partisan media outlets like Fox News. Users fear blind trust in AI outputs could lead to misinformation or subtle ideological shifts.  

3. **Economic Models and Lock-In**:  
   - Critics compare Silicon Valley’s “rent-seeking” tendencies (vendor lock-in, closed ecosystems) to China’s state-driven public investment model. Some argue proprietary AI infrastructure risks replicating exploitative dynamics seen in housing or healthcare.  
   - A GPU glut could lower compute costs, enabling scientific research or a second-hand market, but openness is key to democratizing access.  

4. **AI’s Utility and Hype**:  
   - Comparisons to past tech bubbles (Tamagotchi, dotcom crash) suggest AI might be overhyped. However, others counter that AI’s applications in science and data analytics could sustain its relevance beyond short-term hype.  
   - Doubts about AGI’s feasibility persist, with some viewing current AI as a tool for profit maximization rather than societal benefit.  

5. **Ethical and Political Implications**:  
   - Debates over whether AI development prioritizes public good (e.g., healthcare, housing) or shareholder profits. References to “morality dictates” highlight tensions between ethical imperatives and capitalist incentives.  

**Bottom Line**: The AI boom’s legacy hinges on openness. Without interoperable standards, today’s investments risk becoming stranded assets. If openness spreads, the current buildout could evolve into a shared platform, but skepticism remains about overcoming proprietary control and ensuring equitable access.

### Coral Protocol: Open infrastructure connecting the internet of agents

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00749) | 41 points | by [joj333](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=joj333) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45555012)

Coral Protocol aims to be a vendor‑neutral backbone for the emerging “Internet of Agents,” proposing an open, decentralized way for AI agents from different companies and domains to talk, coordinate, build trust, and handle payments.

Highlights
- What it is: A 46‑page whitepaper (arXiv:2505.00749) specifying a common language and coordination framework so any agent can join multi‑agent workflows across vendors.
- Why it matters: Today’s agent ecosystems are siloed and vendor‑locked. A shared protocol could enable plug‑and‑play collaboration, reduce integration glue code, and unlock more complex, cross‑org automations.
- Core pieces:
  - Standardized messaging formats for agent-to-agent communication.
  - A modular coordination layer to orchestrate multi‑agent tasks.
  - Secure team formation to dynamically assemble trusted groups of agents.
  - Built‑in primitives for trust and payments to support commercial interactions.
- Positioning: Frames itself as foundational infrastructure—akin to an interoperability layer—rather than another agent runtime or framework.
- Scope: Emphasizes broad compatibility, security, and vendor neutrality to avoid lock‑in and enable wide adoption.

What to watch
- Adoption: Success hinges on buy‑in from major agent platforms and tool vendors—and on coexistence with existing ad‑hoc APIs and prior MAS standards.
- Practicalities: Performance, security models, identity, and payment rails will be key in real deployments; the paper outlines the concepts, but real‑world integration and governance will determine traction.
- Maturity: This is a whitepaper/spec proposal (v2 as of Jul 17, 2025); look for reference implementations, SDKs, and early network effects.

Paper: Coral Protocol: Open Infrastructure Connecting The Internet of Agents (arXiv:2505.00749, DOI: 10.48550/arXiv.2505.00749)

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Coral Protocol:**  

The discussion revolves around skepticism, technical critiques, and project legitimacy concerns regarding Coral Protocol, a proposed decentralized framework for AI agent interoperability. Key points:

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/anthropics/prompt-eng-interactive-tutorial) | 291 points | by [cjbarber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cjbarber) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551260)

Anthropic’s Interactive Prompt Engineering Tutorial (GitHub)

What it is:
- A free, hands-on course from Anthropic on writing effective prompts for LLMs, packaged as Jupyter notebooks (also available as a Google Sheets version via Claude for Sheets).
- Uses Claude 3 Haiku for examples, with notes on Sonnet and Opus; most techniques are model-agnostic.

What’s inside:
- 9 chapters from beginner to advanced with exercises and answer keys.
- Core topics: prompt structure, clarity, role assignment, separating data from instructions, output formatting, guiding step-by-step reasoning, and using examples.
- Advanced: reducing hallucinations, building complex/industry prompts (chatbots, legal, finance, coding).
- Appendix on chaining prompts, tool use, and retrieval.

Why it matters:
- Offers concrete, reproducible templates and practice scenarios—useful for teams standardizing LLM workflows and for newcomers who want 80/20 techniques that noticeably improve output quality.

Repo signals:
- ~19.3k stars, ~1.9k forks; notebook-heavy (Jupyter ~98%).

The discussion debates whether "prompt engineering" qualifies as legitimate **engineering**, with arguments centered on definitions, terminology, and professional standards:

1. **Terminology Debate**:
   - Critics (e.g., *jwr*) argue traditional engineering relies on **predictable, knowledge-based principles** (e.g., physics), whereas prompt engineering is seen as trial-and-error "throwing prompts at a wall."
   - Proponents note "engineering" has broader dictionary definitions (e.g., "skillful maneuvering"), and disciplines like software engineering also deal with **non-deterministic systems** (*vmr*, *smnw*).

2. **Professional Standards**:
   - In Canada and other regions, "Engineer" is a **legally protected title** requiring licensure (*rr808*, *rl*), sparking tension with self-described "prompt engineers."
   - Some argue credentials shouldn’t gatekeep the term (*dlchn*), while others emphasize legal responsibilities tied to regulated engineering roles.

3. **Technical Validity**:
   - Critics highlight the **lack of predictability** in LLM outputs and evolving models, contrasting with established engineering practices (*ndsrnm*).
   - Supporters counter that systematic testing, metrics, and iterative refinement (*atherton33*) align with engineering rigor, even in non-deterministic contexts.

4. **Comparisons to Software Engineering**:
   - Parallels are drawn to software engineering’s acceptance despite dealing with **unpredictable systems** (e.g., distributed networks), suggesting prompt engineering could follow a similar path (*nthrbnnsr*).

**Conclusion**: The debate reflects broader tensions over language, professional identity, and evolving technical fields. While critics dismiss prompt engineering as unserious, proponents frame it as a nascent discipline requiring systematic approaches akin to other engineering domains.

### CamoLeak: Critical GitHub Copilot Vulnerability Leaks Private Source Code

#### [Submission URL](https://www.legitsecurity.com/blog/camoleak-critical-github-copilot-vulnerability-leaks-private-source-code) | 126 points | by [greyadept](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=greyadept) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553422)

What happened
- Security researcher Omer Mayraz disclosed a CVSS 9.6 vulnerability in GitHub Copilot Chat that allowed silent exfiltration of secrets and source code from private repos and full control over Copilot’s replies (e.g., injecting malicious code suggestions/links). Reported via HackerOne; GitHub fixed it by disabling image rendering in Copilot Chat.

How it worked (high level)
- Remote prompt injection: Hidden comments in pull request descriptions (“invisible comments,” an official GitHub feature) were used to smuggle instructions into Copilot’s context. Any user viewing the PR and using Copilot Chat could have their assistant hijacked, with Copilot operating under that user’s permissions.
- CSP bypass using GitHub’s own infra: Although GitHub’s strict Content Security Policy blocks arbitrary external fetches, GitHub rewrites external images through its Camo proxy (camo.githubusercontent.com) with signed URLs. By creatively leveraging Camo URL generation paths, the researcher found a way to smuggle data out despite CSP.

Why it matters
- AI assistants that ingest repository context dramatically broaden the attack surface: invisible or innocuous-looking repo content can steer the model, leak sensitive data, or push malicious dependencies.
- The combination of model prompt injection and front-end CSP edge cases creates powerful cross-layer exploits.

What GitHub changed
- Disabled image rendering in Copilot Chat to close the exfil channel tied to Markdown-rendered images/Camo.
- Vulnerability was remediated after disclosure; details credit GitHub’s response but underscore systemic risks.

Takeaways for teams
- Treat AI assistants as privileged actors: restrict their repo/org scopes and tokens to least privilege.
- Scrub untrusted content in repos (PR descriptions, READMEs, issues) that surfaces in AI context; consider policies for hidden/embedded content.
- Disable or limit rich rendering in AI chats where possible; prefer link sanitization/allow-lists.
- Maintain defense-in-depth: secrets scanning, dependency allow-lists, and mandatory human review on AI-suggested changes.

The discussion surrounding the CamoLeak GitHub Copilot vulnerability highlights several key points and concerns:  

### **Technical Insights**  
1. **Fix Critique**: While GitHub addressed the issue by disabling image rendering in Copilot Chat, some users (*mnchlx*, *Thorrez*) argue this only closed one exfiltration vector. They speculate that alternative methods (e.g., base64 encoding or non-Camo URLs) might still bypass CSP if not fully mitigated.  
2. **Exploit Mechanics**: The attack combined GitHub’s Camo proxy (to bypass CSP) and invisible PR comments (a legitimate GitHub feature) for stealthy prompt injection. Users (*chrcrct*, *PufPufPuf*) emphasize the risk of attackers leveraging contributor text (PRs, issues) to hijack AI context and permissions.  

### **Broader AI Security Concerns**  
- **Trust in AI Tools**: Participants (*rnnngmk*) question the reliability of proprietary AI solutions in cybersecurity, advocating for FOSS alternatives with greater transparency.  
- **LLM Vulnerabilities**: Subthreads debate whether modern LLMs are inherently vulnerable to prompt injection, comparing mitigations to "ASLR for AI" but acknowledging systemic challenges (*fn-mt*, *PufPufPuf*).  
- **Scope of Risk**: Hidden HTML/PR comments (*xstf*, *RulerOf*) and over-permissioned AI agents (*chrcrct*) are flagged as ongoing attack surfaces.  

### **Mitigation Suggestions**  
- **Local AI Agents**: A user (*nprtm*) proposes running AI tools locally to reduce exposure, though practicality is debated.  
- **Input Sanitization**: Calls to sanitize PR templates and restrict LLM access to untrusted content (*PufPufPuf*, *djmps*).  

### **Community Reaction**  
- **Mixed Sentiment**: Some praise the disclosure (*adastra22*) and GitHub’s response, while others criticize incomplete fixes (*mnchlx*) or urge readers to review the original report (*frh*: "RTFA/RTFTLDR").  

### **Key Takeaway**  
The discussion underscores the complexity of securing AI-integrated tools, balancing prompt fixes with systemic changes to LLM permissions, input validation, and CSP enforcement. The incident highlights how "benign" platform features (like Camo proxy) can become critical vulnerabilities when combined with AI context-hijacking.

### Paper2video: Automatic video generation from scientific papers

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05096) | 76 points | by [jinqueeny](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jinqueeny) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45553701)

TL;DR: A new benchmark + system that auto-generates academic presentation videos straight from papers—slides, subtitles, speech, cursor movements, and a talking head—claiming higher faithfulness than existing baselines. Dataset and code are linked on the arXiv page.

What’s new
- Paper2Video benchmark: 101 research papers paired with author-made presentation videos, slides, and speaker metadata to study presentation generation.
- Four evaluation metrics, tailored for “did the video actually teach the paper?”: Meta Similarity, PresentArena, PresentQuiz, and IP Memory.
- PaperTalker system: a multi-agent pipeline that:
  - Generates slides and refines layout via a tree-search-based “visual choice” step
  - Extracts and places dense multimodal content (text, figures, tables)
  - Grounds a cursor to guide attention
  - Produces subtitles and TTS speech
  - Renders a talking head
  - Parallelizes slide-wise generation for speed

Why it matters
- Academic videos are time sinks; automating 2–10 minute summaries could free researchers from slide design and recording.
- Coordinated, multimodal alignment (slides + narration + on-screen pointer + face) is a tougher problem than generic video gen; the benchmark and metrics help standardize evaluation.
- Accessibility and dissemination: makes papers more approachable to wider audiences.

Results (per authors)
- On the Paper2Video benchmark, generated presentations are “more faithful and informative” than prior baselines across the proposed metrics.
- Code, dataset, and project page are available via the arXiv entry.

Caveats and open questions
- Scale: 101 papers is a solid start but still small; generalization across fields and layouts remains to be shown.
- Metric validity: how strongly do PresentArena/PresentQuiz/etc. correlate with human comprehension?
- IP and consent: reuse of figures, author likeness/voice, and distribution policies will matter in practice.
- Hallucinations and factual drift: long-context, figure-heavy papers are risky; robust grounding and citation display will be key.

Link: arXiv: 2510.05096 (project page and code linked from the arXiv record)

The discussion around the Paper2Video submission highlights a mix of cautious optimism, practical concerns, and humorous skepticism:

### **Key Points**
1. **Potential Benefits**:
   - **Time-saving**: Users acknowledge automating presentations could free researchers from tedious slide design and recording, especially for conferences requiring travel.
   - **Accessibility**: Could make dense papers more approachable for broader audiences, including non-experts or students.
   - **Baseline Improvement**: Some note existing scientific presentations often suffer from cluttered slides or poor design, which AI might mitigate.

2. **Criticisms & Concerns**:
   - **Depth & Engagement**: Skepticism about whether AI-generated videos can capture nuanced explanations, storytelling, or clarity that human presenters provide. Comments highlight risks of superficiality ("adding fluff") and missing critical details.
   - **Presentation Quality**: Concerns about AI-generated voices, robotic delivery ("subtle parody"), and awkward visuals (e.g., cursor movements, "talking heads") feeling unnatural compared to human charisma.
   - **Ethics & Practicality**: Questions about intellectual property (figure reuse, voice cloning), hallucination risks in technical content, and whether metrics like "PresentQuiz" truly measure comprehension.

3. **Humorous Takes**:
   - Jokes about AI presenters resembling "SteveGPT" (Steve Jobs-style) or dystopian references (*Videodrome*), highlighting unease with synthetic personas.
   - Playful comparisons to unrelated concepts (e.g., *Lorna Shore concerts*, VR sword-fighting games) underscore concerns about engagement gimmicks.

4. **Related Tools & Alternatives**:
   - Users mention existing solutions like whiteboard explainers, Minute Papers, or improving personal presentation skills. Some share their own projects (e.g., interactive paper explainers) as alternatives.

### **Notable Suggestions**
   - **Improvements**: Incorporate feedback loops for slide layout, avoid verbatim text, and prioritize natural narrative flow over rigid content placement.
   - **Validation**: Calls for human evaluation to complement automated metrics and ensure generated videos aid actual learning.

### **Conclusion**
While the tool is seen as a promising step, many argue that human-presented storytelling and clarity remain irreplaceable. The discussion reflects broader debates about AI’s role in academia—balancing efficiency gains with the risk of depersonalizing science communication.

### Microsoft only lets you opt out of AI photo scanning 3x a year

#### [Submission URL](https://hardware.slashdot.org/story/25/10/11/0238213/microsofts-onedrive-begins-testing-face-recognizing-ai-for-photos-for-some-preview-users) | 750 points | by [dmitrygr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dmitrygr) | [285 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45551504)

Microsoft is testing face recognition in OneDrive photos — with a puzzling “3 times a year” opt-out limit

- What’s happening: Some OneDrive users are seeing a new preview feature that uses AI to recognize faces in their photo libraries. The setting appears as on by default for those in the test.
- The catch: The toggle says you can only turn the feature off three times per year. One tester couldn’t disable it at all — the switch snapped back on with an error.
- Microsoft’s stance: The company confirmed a limited preview but wouldn’t explain the “three times” rule or give a timeline for wider release. It pointed to its privacy statement and EU compliance. A support page still claims the feature is “coming soon,” a note that’s been unchanged for nearly two years.
- Privacy pushback: EFF’s Thorin Klosowski argues the feature should be opt-in with clear documentation, and users should be able to change privacy settings whenever they want.
- Open questions: Is face recognition currently active for any users by default? Why restrict how often people can opt out? When will Microsoft clarify and ship this broadly?

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reflects widespread frustration and skepticism toward Microsoft's "3 times a year" opt-out limit for OneDrive's face recognition feature. Key points include:

1. **Arbitrary Opt-Out Limit**:  
   Users question why the limit is set to three, dismissing theories about cultural symbolism (e.g., religious trinities) and instead attributing it to psychological tactics to discourage opting out. Some suggest it’s a "dark pattern" to normalize surveillance or reduce server costs from repeated scans.

2. **Distrust in Microsoft’s Intentions**:  
   Commenters cite Microsoft’s history of overriding user settings (e.g., re-enabling features after updates) as evidence of bad faith. Many suspect the feature is tied to AI training or data harvesting, with concerns that facial data could be exploited for profit or shared with governments.

3. **Privacy vs. Cost-Saving**:  
   While some argue the limit prevents excessive server costs from frequent re-scans, others counter that privacy controls should never be restricted. Critics demand opt-in defaults and unrestricted opt-out options, echoing the EFF’s stance.

4. **Regulatory and Compliance Concerns**:  
   Questions arise about HIPAA compliance and Microsoft’s ability to safeguard sensitive data. Users highlight past incidents where Microsoft mishandled health or enterprise data, fueling doubts about their reliability.

5. **Technical and Legal Speculation**:  
   Debates focus on whether the limit is technically necessary (e.g., processing large photo libraries) or a legal safeguard to avoid liability. Skeptics argue Microsoft could anonymize data or process it locally but chooses not to for control.

6. **Calls for Transparency**:  
   Participants demand clarity on whether the feature is active by default, how data is used, and when Microsoft will address these concerns. Many urge regulatory intervention to hold the company accountable.

**Overall Sentiment**:  
The community views the opt-out limit as a red flag, emblematic of broader corporate overreach and erosion of user agency. Trust in Microsoft is low, with calls for stricter privacy laws and user-centric design.

### Superpowers: How I'm using coding agents in October 2025

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.fsck.com/2025/10/09/superpowers/) | 378 points | by [Ch00k](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ch00k) | [209 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45547344)

Claude Code gets plugins; “Superpowers” turns skills into a first‑class workflow

- What’s new: Anthropic rolled out a plugin system for Claude Code, and the author released “Superpowers,” a marketplace plugin that teaches Claude to use explicit “skills” (markdown playbooks) to plan and execute coding tasks.

- How to try: Requires Claude Code 2.0.13+. In Claude’s command palette:
  - /plugin marketplace add obra/superpowers-marketplace
  - /plugin install superpowers@superpowers-marketplace
  - Restart Claude; it will bootstrap itself and point to a getting-started SKILL.md.

- How it works:
  - Adds a default brainstorm → plan → implement loop; if you’re in a git repo, it auto-creates a worktree for parallel tasks.
  - Offers two modes: last month’s “human PM + two agents” or a new auto mode that dispatches tasks to subagents and runs code review after each step.
  - Enforces RED/GREEN TDD: write a failing test, make it pass, iterate.
  - Wraps up by offering to open a GitHub PR, merge the worktree, or stop.

- The big idea: Skills. They’re small, readable SKILL.md guides that the agent must use when applicable. The system encourages:
  - Discovering and invoking skills by name.
  - Writing new skills as the agent learns (self-improvement).
  - Extracting reusable skills from books/codebases by reading, reflecting, and documenting.

- Why it matters:
  - Moves agents from “prompt blob” to modular, auditable procedures.
  - Encourages reproducibility, code quality (TDD + reviews), and parallel dev via worktrees.
  - Aligns with a broader pattern (e.g., Microsoft’s Amplifier) where agents evolve by writing tools/docs for themselves.

- Notable details:
  - The author has a “How to create skills” skill; the system can expand itself by drafting new SKILL.md files.
  - Skill quality is tested with subagents using realistic, pressure-testing scenarios—“TDD for skills.”
  - Mentions IP gray areas when auto-extracting skills from proprietary books.

- Open questions:
  - How robust are skills across projects and teams?
  - Governance/attribution for skill content derived from third-party materials.
  - How well do subagent reviews catch subtle design or security flaws versus happy-path tests?

Takeaway: Plugins plus skills push Claude Code toward a disciplined, self-improving dev assistant—less chatty copilot, more process-driven teammate with standardized playbooks.

The discussion around AI coding tools like Claude Code's new plugin system and "Superpowers" reveals mixed experiences and perspectives:

### Key Themes:
1. **Effectiveness Varies by Task Complexity**:
   - Users report success with **micro-tasks** (e.g., templating HTML/CSS, writing tests) and repetitive work, but note limitations in **high-level design** or complex domains (e.g., Zig development).
   - For troubleshooting legacy codebases or dependency issues, Claude Code is praised for rapidly identifying solutions, though results can be inconsistent in extreme edge cases.

2. **Human Oversight & Process**:
   - Several users emphasize the need for **explicit instructions**, structured workflows (e.g., TDD, code reviews), and documentation to ensure quality. One user compares managing AI agents to leading a team, requiring clear planning, feedback, and quality checks.
   - Breaking tasks into smaller, specific chunks with thorough validation is advised over delegating large, vague goals.

3. **Skepticism vs. Optimism**:
   - **Optimists** highlight AI’s utility for accelerating coding, learning, and handling "run-of-the-mill" tasks (e.g., generating test cases), likening it to a junior developer.
   - **Skeptics** caution against over-reliance, noting AI can produce "nonsense" or overstep its domain. Some argue AI tools augment rather than revolutionize development, stressing the irreplaceable role of human design decisions.

4. **Challenges & Open Questions**:
   - **Token consumption** and context management with subagents raise concerns about efficiency.
   - Debate exists about whether AI’s "persuasive" outputs align with true problem-solving or merely mimic rhetorical patterns.
   - Questions linger about skill reproducibility across teams and governance for skills derived from proprietary materials.

### Notable Perspectives:
- **"kdd"** shares a [blog post](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45503867) stressing the need for technical management skills when using AI agents, akin to mentoring interns.
- **"sfn42"** advocates using AI as a "tight leash" tool for specific subtasks rather than autonomous large-scale work.
- **"smnw"** links to a [GitHub repo](https://github.com/obra/Superpowers) and [notes](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct10/superpowers/) exploring skill-based workflows.

### Conclusion:
While AI coding tools show promise for productivity gains, success hinges on structured workflows, human oversight, and task specificity. The community remains divided on whether these tools represent incremental improvement or transformative change, with ongoing experimentation shaping best practices.
