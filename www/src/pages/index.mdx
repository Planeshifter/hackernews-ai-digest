### Building a collaborative pixel art editor with CRDTs

#### [Submission URL](https://jakelazaroff.com/words/building-a-collaborative-pixel-art-editor-with-crdts/) | 151 points | by [jakelazaroff](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jakelazaroff) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37832432)

In today's post "Building a Collaborative Pixel Art Editor with CRDTs" on jakelazaroff.com, the author takes us through the process of using Conflict-free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) to build a collaborative pixel art editor. The post assumes no prior knowledge about CRDTs and provides a basic introduction to the topic.

The author starts by explaining that they will be using JavaScript and graphics programming to demonstrate how CRDTs can be implemented in a real-world application. They provide the necessary code to build the CRDT, which is a class called PixelData that acts as a wrapper over a Last Write Wins (LWW) Map. The PixelData class maps pixel coordinates to colors, with each key representing a single pixel.

The author then provides a visualization of how the keys and values interact when drawing on the canvas. They show how painting a pixel sets the key value to the selected RGB color, and how pixels that haven't been set default to white. When painting over a pixel, the value is overwritten and the timestamp is incremented.

Moving on to the UI, the author shares the HTML and CSS code for setting up the canvas and color input elements. They then provide JavaScript code to instantiate two editors, Alice and Bob, which are instances of the PixelEditor class. The states of Alice and Bob are merged whenever a change is made in either editor, and the color is set based on user input.

Overall, this post serves as a practical example of how CRDTs can be used in a collaborative application, specifically a pixel art editor. By following the author's explanations and code samples, readers can gain a deeper understanding of CRDTs and how they can be implemented in their own projects.

The discussion revolves around several aspects of the post. 

One user points out that training models to resolve conflicts in collaborative dating can be interesting, and they mention a specific case on GitHub where conflict resolution was handled manually. They also suggest that having non-interactive resolution as the default in developer tools could lead to the loss of work in certain situations, like large refactorings.

Another user mentions that conflicts in CRDTs can be resolved at a semantic layer and provides an example of how conflicts in a canvas can be resolved by prioritizing the most recent drawing. They emphasize the importance of understanding semantics to resolve conflicts effectively.

There is a discussion about whether or not text convergence is guaranteed with CRDTs. One user argues that CRDTs do not guarantee semantic content preservation, while another user explains how they handle nested data in a CRDT to ensure content convergence.

The discussion also touches on the benefits of CRDTs and how they can handle conflict resolution in a self-driving manner, making it easier to work with conflicts in simpler domains.

Another user raises the challenge of preserving the intent of content, particularly when it involves making human-like judgment calls, and mentions that CRDTs provide consistency but may not handle judgment calls effectively.

There is also dialogue about the convergence of state in CRDTs, with one user pointing out that while CRDTs technically converge resulting in the same state, the neural network approach ensures that the final state matches the human's intended state more reliably.

A user shares a link to a related discussion on Our World Pixels, mentioning the date and number of comments.

Finally, there are a few comments about the syntax, font, and highlighting of code in the post, with one user suggesting a specific font family for code.

The discussion is informative and includes various perspectives and insights related to the topic of CRDTs and collaborative pixel art editing.

Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), which refers to AI systems that exhibit human-level intelligence across a wide range of tasks, is already here, according to Blaise Agüera y Arcas, a vice president at Google Research, and Peter Norvig, a computer scientist at Stanford. They argue that although today's advanced AI models have many flaws, they have already achieved the key properties of generality that define AGI. These "frontier models" can perform a variety of tasks, operate on different modalities like text, images, and audio, handle multiple languages, and learn from prompts rather than just training data. While these models still have limitations, the authors believe they will be recognized as the first true examples of AGI in the future. They compare this to the ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer, which paved the way for today's computers. The authors emphasize that AGI should be seen as a multidimensional scorecard rather than a simple yes/no proposition.

### The rent is too damn algorithmic

#### [Submission URL](https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/631461/the-rent-is-too-damn-algorithmic/) | 111 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37829575)

Attorney General Brian Schwalb is investigating a company called RealPage for potential antitrust violations in the housing industry. RealPage provides software that recommends rent prices for apartments based on market data. Critics argue that the company's algorithm effectively enables collusion among big landlords to fix prices. Schwalb has proposed hiring a law firm to assist with the investigation and potential litigation against RealPage and other targets in the housing industry. The Texas-based company is already facing multiple lawsuits and an antitrust investigation by the Department of Justice. This could be one of the first challenges to RealPage by state attorneys general.

The discussion on Hacker News about the submission focuses on various aspects of the antitrust investigation against RealPage and the implications of their software on the housing market. Here are the main points discussed:

- Some users argue that RealPage's software enables collusion among landlords and effectively fixes rent prices. They point out that the software allows landlords to coordinate and set prices based on market data, potentially leading to higher rents.
- Others suggest that the problem lies with the shortage of housing supply, rather than RealPage's software. They argue that if there were enough available housing units, the market forces would naturally adjust prices. They criticize the company for taking advantage of the scarcity of housing.
- There is a debate about whether the actions of RealPage constitute a market manipulation or just a reflection of the supply and demand dynamics. Some users argue that market forces are at play, while others believe that there is a manipulation of prices by large landlords.
- One user suggests that one possible solution to address the issue would be to remove class entirely from residential property. They argue that housing should not be treated as an investment, as it contributes to pricing out many people and exacerbates the shortage of affordable housing.
- The discussion also touches on the idea of induced demand and its impact on traffic congestion. Some users argue that increasing housing supply could lead to more people moving to the city and worsening congestion, while others believe that the lack of affordable housing forces people to live far away from their workplaces, causing traffic jams.
- A user mentions the housing market in Germany, where the construction of housing is more focused on short-term rentals and leads to a shortage of affordable housing. They argue that construction should prioritize long-term housing solutions and consider the environmental impact.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities and different perspectives surrounding the investigation into RealPage and the broader issues of affordability and market dynamics in the housing industry.

### Lit 3.0

#### [Submission URL](https://lit.dev/blog/2023-10-10-lit-3.0/) | 116 points | by [meiraleal](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meiraleal) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37834927)

Today is an exciting day for the Lit project and the web components community. The Lit team has officially released Lit 3.0, marking their first major version since Lit 2.0 in early 2021. In addition to Lit 3.0, they also announced the graduation of the first class of Lit Labs packages, which include @lit/react, @lit/task, and @lit/context. But that's not all! The team also released two bonus packages: @lit-labs/compiler and @lit-labs/preact-signals.

One of the main highlights of Lit 3.0 is the removal of support for IE11. After surveying the developer community, the team felt that now is the right time to say goodbye to IE11. This release also introduces some additional breaking changes that remove technical debt and pave the way for new features planned for future releases.

Despite being a breaking change release, Lit 3.0 does include one new feature: support for the TC39 standard decorators specification. With the arrival of standard decorators, Lit can begin transitioning to a decorator implementation that doesn't require a compiler to use. The team has made efforts to ensure a smooth upgrade path from experimental decorators to the standard spec.

Another noteworthy release is the new @lit-labs/compiler package. This Labs package provides a TypeScript Transformer that can be used during build-time preparation of Lit templates, resulting in faster rendering performance. According to benchmarks, the new compiler can improve first render speed by 46% and update speed by 21%.

For those interested in upgrading to Lit 3.0, the process should be seamless for most users. Simply update the npm dependency version to the latest release of Lit.

Overall, these releases demonstrate the Lit team's commitment to stability, performance, and adherence to standards. The Lit project continues to evolve and improve, offering developers powerful tools for building web components.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to Lit 3.0 and web components. Here are some key points:

- Some users express their excitement for the Lit project and the new releases, while others mention potential benefits like improved performance and better integration with other frameworks.
- There is a discussion about the difficulty of getting started with Lit and the benefits of using pre-existing design systems like Shoelace.
- Some users discuss the advantages of web components and their potential integration with frameworks like React and Vue.
- There is a debate about the relevance of web components and their adoption in the industry. Some users mention the limitations of React and the benefits of using Lit as a smaller and more efficient library.
- A user highlights the progress made in the Lit project, comparing it to jQuery in terms of simplifying web development.
- There is a discussion about the similarities and differences between Lit and other web frameworks.
- Some users mention the importance of standardization and the potential of web components to facilitate component integration across different platforms.
- Other topics include the performance improvements in Lit's compiled templates and the advantages of using compiled templates for optimization.

Introducing the Polymathic AI initiative, a research project aiming to accelerate the development of versatile foundation models for scientific machine learning tasks. While there have been significant advances in machine learning for vision and natural language processing, the same paradigm shift has not yet occurred for scientific datasets. The goal of Polymathic AI is to build AI models that can leverage information from heterogeneous datasets and across different scientific fields. By providing off-the-shelf models with strong priors for scientific concepts, the initiative aims to democratize AI in science. The project brings together a team of machine learning researchers and domain scientists and is guided by a scientific advisory group. Preliminary research has already been published on key architectural components, and the initiative holds great potential to redefine the landscape of scientific machine learning.

The discussion about the Polymathic AI initiative on Hacker News includes a few comments. One user, "wrsh07," finds the announcement paper interesting and shares a link to it.  Another user, "xlxbr," expresses difficulties in finding information about the organization on the Polymathic AI website. They wonder about the participating institutions and the skills required for participation.  A user called "jsndvs" suspects that this might be a collaborative scientific effort supported by commercial enterprises. They mention the Flatiron Institute and the Simons Foundation as potential supporters based on a tweet from the Polymathic AI account. They also provide a link to the Simons Foundation's website, which they believe provides informative press releases about the initiative. Another user, "hltst," finds the work interesting and highlights the discovery of promising concepts related to dynamics in static and dynamic systems.
