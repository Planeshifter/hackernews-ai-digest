### How to create an AI narrator for your life

#### [Submission URL](https://replicate.com/blog/how-to-create-an-ai-narrator) | 32 points | by [Charlieholtz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Charlieholtz) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38550486)

In a recent viral video, an AI clone of Sir David Attenborough narrated a man's everyday activities, bringing a touch of whimsy and humor to the mundane. Inspired by this, the video's creator shared how to create your own AI narrator for your life. The process involves using three AI models: a vision model that can "see" through your computer camera and describe what it sees, a language model that generates the script in the style of your chosen narrator, and a text-to-speech model that gives the script a spoken audio output.

To "see" through your camera, you can use the Llava 13B model, which is cheap and fast, or the GPT-4-Vision model, which is smarter but slightly slower and more expensive. These models take images and text prompts as inputs and provide text responses about the image. 
To feed images to the vision model, you can use your computer's webcam. You'll need a script that takes a photo from the webcam every few seconds and saves it to a file. Downsizing the images will make it faster and cheaper for the vision model to process.
For generating the script, you can use a language model like Mistral 7B. You can prompt the model to write a script in the style of your chosen narrator, using the output from the vision model as the description. Limiting the maximum tokens returned will ensure faster response times.
Finally, you'll need a text-to-speech model to give the script a spoken audio output. The aim is to make it sound natural and not robotic. By following these steps, you can create your own AI narrator to add a touch of creativity and entertainment to your daily life.

So, why not embrace the magic of AI and let an AI narrator bring your everyday activities to life in a fun and whimsical way?

The discussion surrounding the submission includes several comments:
- User "krdlssgn" shares a link to a GitHub repository that replicates the style of Sir David Attenborough's narration using OpenAI's models. They provide instructions on how to download the JSON file and import the pipeline using MittaAI.
- User "msingh_5" expresses concern about installing cameras at home, particularly in the kitchen and front door areas, due to privacy issues. They mention that they would rather use reminders for tasks like cooking chicken or bringing shopping bags or an umbrella based on weather updates and calendar events.
- User "crtvnl" criticizes the idea, calling it a shameless and negligent way of promoting a particular company under the guise of a creative project.
- User "Borrible" suggests an alternative to using AI narration, mentioning a service called SupernannAI, which offers a more centralized and flexible voice-over solution. They also jokingly mention the Spanish Inquisition.
- User "dr" expresses enjoyment in running video deep fakes in real-time.

- User "Charlieholtz" humorously agrees with the concept and mentions that it could be a fun way to play with the models.

Researchers from UC Berkeley and Johns Hopkins University have introduced a novel approach to learning Large Vision Models (LVM) without relying on linguistic data. They define a common format called "visual sentences" to represent raw images and videos, as well as annotated data sources like semantic segmentations and depth reconstructions. By representing visual data as sequences and training the model to predict the next token, they demonstrate that LVMs can scale effectively across various model architectures and data diversity. The researchers also show that larger LVMs perform better on downstream tasks and provide examples of prompts for tasks like frame predictions, in and out of distribution prompting, compositing, novel tasks, and non-verbal IQ tests.

The discussion around the submission covers a range of topics related to large vision models and artificial general intelligence (AGI). Some users compare the approach to other models like General Pattern Machines and DeepMind's Gato, while others discuss the potential applications of large language models in manipulating visual data. The concept of AGI and its definition is also debated, with some users arguing that machines cannot possess true general intelligence. The topic of captchas and their effectiveness in distinguishing humans from AI is also raised, with some questioning the ethical implications of using captchas. Overall, there is a mixture of technical analysis, speculation, and philosophical debate in the discussion.

### IBM releases first-ever 1k-qubit quantum chip

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-03854-1) | 38 points | by [birriel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=birriel) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38520757)

IBM has announced the development of the first quantum computer with over 1,000 qubits – the quantum equivalent of digital bits in a classical computer. However, instead of continuing to increase the number of qubits in its machines, IBM will now focus on improving error resistance. Quantum states are notoriously prone to errors, and IBM plans to address this issue by using error-correction techniques that would require fewer physical qubits. The company aims to build chips designed to hold a few error-corrected qubits in about 400 physical qubits and network them together. This approach could reduce the number of physical qubits needed for useful computations by a factor of 10 or more. IBM's road map for its quantum research envisions achieving useful computations within the next decade.

The discussion on this submission primarily revolves around the topic of logical qubits and error-correction techniques in quantum computing. One user, vlovich123, points out that the reported numbers of qubits in quantum computers may refer to logical qubits rather than physical qubits. They mention that research generally indicates that error-correction techniques require around 1000 physical qubits for each logical qubit, and express excitement about an alternative error-correction scheme called quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) that could reduce this ratio by a factor of 10.

Another user, d-bcn, argues that 10 logical qubits defined on just one physical qubit is a reasonable definition of a logical qubit and highlights Google's work on quantum error correction. They discuss experiments that demonstrate fault-tolerant quantum error correction using 13 physical qubits and note that other groups have also achieved small-scale logical qubits with improved performance.

In response to vlovich123's earlier comment, d-bcn mentions that they have likely managed to create a logical qubit, pointing to experimental evidence from Egan and Google. They provide links to two experiments that showed small improvements in logical performance, although the improvements were relatively small in scale.

In conclusion, the discussion involves a technical debate about the definition and implementation of logical qubits, as well as the advancements and challenges in error-correction techniques for quantum computing.
