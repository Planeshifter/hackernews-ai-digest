### Intel's 14A Magic Bullet: Directed Self-Assembly (DSA)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.semianalysis.com/p/intels-14a-magic-bullet-directed) | 49 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40091314)

Intel is making waves in the tech world with its cutting-edge 14A node, which could be a game-changer for the chip giant. While Intel's 18A node has been in the spotlight, it's the 14A node that may determine Intel's success in the foundry business. This node is crucial for winning over key customers who rely on state-of-the-art technology for their flagship products. One of Intel's key strategies involves adopting ASML's high-NA EUV lithography scanners, setting them ahead of the competition. Despite the higher cost associated with high-NA lithography, Intel has a secret weapon up its sleeve: Directed Self-Assembly (DSA). This innovative technology could significantly reduce lithography costs, making high-NA a more viable option for Intel's future success.

DSA works by utilizing the self-organizing properties of block copolymers, guided by pre-patterned templates, to create intricate patterns with lower exposure doses. This method not only reduces costs but also improves image quality, addressing the CD vs. dose tradeoff prevalent in high-NA lithography. Intel's bold bet on high-NA lithography combined with DSA could reshape the semiconductor landscape, with implications for key players like TSMC, ASML, and others. As Intel pushes the boundaries of innovation, all eyes are on how this technology will unfold and revolutionize the industry.

- There is a discussion about the high-NA (Numerical Aperture) and its significance in the tech world. The conversation touches on the numerical aperture in the optical system and its dimensionalless number characterizing the range of angles the system can accept light. There is a mention of high-NA lithography and a link to more information on numerical aperture on Wikipedia.
- Another topic of discussion revolves around Intel's customers and their demand for 18A chips, highlighting the importance of advanced technology in creating critical chips for businesses. There is a question raised about how efficiently Intel's technology works and how it compares to competitors like TSMC, with a user agreeing that Intel has struggled in the past but believes in their reinvention with the 14A node.	
- The final comment mentions the article's fantastic quality, jokingly referring to paying $500 to read it only halfway through. Another user comments on the hidden information in the article, referring to it as valuable but concealed within the text.
