### Fake News Detectors Are Biased Against Texts Generated by Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08674) | 16 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37712713)

A new study has found that fake news detectors are biased against texts generated by large language models (LLMs). The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge, and LLMs have only intensified this issue by being able to generate highly believable fake content. The study revealed that existing detectors are more likely to flag LLM-generated content as fake news while misclassifying human-written fake news as genuine. This unexpected bias is due to distinct linguistic patterns in LLM outputs. To address this bias, the researchers introduced a mitigation strategy using adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news. This approach significantly improved the detection accuracy for both human and LLM-generated news. To encourage further research in this area, the researchers released two comprehensive datasets that combine human-validated articles with LLM-generated fake and real news.

The discussion begins with a user named Hendrikto expressing their interest in large language models (LLMs) and how they can generate both truthful statements and plausible fake news. They find it interesting that LLMs tend to flag LLM-generated content as fake news but misclassify human-written fake news as genuine. They mention that the researchers addressed this bias by using adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news, resulting in improved detection accuracy for both human and LLM-generated news. Another user, flr, suggests that this sounds like a "rabbit myth" and compares it to classifiers that mistake cloudy days for sunny ones.

User ttctcyf raises a point about the specificity of fake news sources and mentions a paper that lists different news sites categorized as either reliable or unreliable. They provide some examples of unreliable news websites labeled as conspiracy, pseudo-science, and misinformation. They also note that reliable news websites consist of mainstream and center-right sources. Another user, hlt, comments that LLMs are supposed to determine the truthfulness of things.

Then, user fllngknf states that humans can detect fake news and suggests that training LLMs to detect fake news is pointless. In response, user marginalia_nu points out the contradiction in the statement, mentioning that while humans cannot fly, machines can. Another user, ben_w, highlights the difficulty of determining truthfulness and mentions the concept of Munchausen Trilemma, where establishing perfect certainty about truth is impossible. They explain that all tests mimic system 2 thinking, which is slower than the decision-making done by humans. User marginalia_nu adds that generating labeled data holds challenges, as it may have undesired properties and can lead to different types of generated fake news. Another user, smbz, mentions the importance of human verification.

Finally, Grimblewald argues that humans have good detection of fake news through critical analysis and suggests that relying on technology alone is not sufficient for spotting fake news.

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-language-models-can-exceed-png-and-flac-in-lossless-compression-says-study/) | 74 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37691535)

Researchers from DeepMind have discovered that their large language model, Chinchilla 70B, can perform lossless compression on images and audio data, outperforming algorithms specifically designed for these tasks. In a research paper titled "Language Modeling Is Compression," the team details how Chinchilla compressed image patches from the ImageNet database to 43.4% of their original size, surpassing the PNG algorithm's compression rate of 58.5%. For audio data, Chinchilla achieved a compression rate of 16.4% compared to FLAC compression at 30.3%. This finding suggests that language models like Chinchilla can be used not only for text prediction and writing but also for effectively compressing various types of data. The relationship between compression and intelligence is a topic of ongoing debate and research.

### RZK: Experimental proof assistant for synthetic ∞-categories

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/rzk-lang/rzk) | 58 points | by [adamnemecek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamnemecek) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37692166)

Introducing rzk: An Experimental Proof Assistant for Synthetic ∞-Categories

rzk is an experimental proof assistant based on a type theory for synthetic ∞-categories. Built as a way to bring Riehl and Shulman's 2017 paper to life, rzk aims to implement a proof assistant capable of checking various formalizations. It currently offers an online playground for testing, with larger formalizations available in related projects. The implementation uses a version of second-order abstract syntax and aims to support dependent type inference in the future. An important component of rzk is a tope layer solver, which functions as a theorem prover for a part of the type theory. Additionally, rzk plans to incorporate a project called simple-topes, which supports user-defined cubes, topes, and tope layer axioms. This expansion will allow for formalizations of cubical, globular, and other geometric versions of HoTT. For smaller formalizations, users can utilize the online playground, while larger and multi-file formalizations can be installed locally using the latest stable or development version of rzk. There is also a VS Code extension available on the Marketplace for syntax highlighting and other features.

The submission is about rzk, an experimental proof assistant for synthetic ∞-categories. The discussion on Hacker News includes various comments discussing the topic. Some users discuss the implementation and features of rzk, while others discuss category theory and its relevance to computer science and mathematics. There is also a mention of the influence of category theory on programming languages like Haskell and the connection between category theory and the development of modern programming languages and libraries.
