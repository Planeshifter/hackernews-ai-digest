At Qodo, we're taking the world of AI coding assistants to new heights with the help of LangGraph. Since the release of Claude Sonnet 3.5 nine months ago, large language models (LLMs) have transformed how we tackle coding tasks, and we're embracing this by making our agents more dynamic and flexible while maintaining high standards for code quality.

Our journey began with structured flows for tasks like test generation and code reviews that worked well with older models. However, the robustness of newer models encouraged us to transition from rigid frameworks to more adaptive agents. We needed a system that aligned with our opinionated views on AI in coding and could keep pace with rapid advancements in the field. That's where LangGraph came in.

LangGraph allows us to blend flexibility with structure through a graph-based approach, making it easy to create workflows that are adaptable yet opinionated. The framework enables a state-machine architecture, where nodes represent workflow steps and edges dictate transitions. Whether we create sparse graphs for predictable outcomes or dense ones for more autonomy, LangGraph provides the flexibility to fine-tune our flows as models evolve.

Our main workflow exemplifies this flexibility. It starts with a context collector node gathering essential information, followed by a planning node to outline the task, an execution node for code generation, and a validation node to ensure quality. If validation fails, the agent loops back to execution for refinement, ensuring robustness without sacrificing adaptability.

LangGraph's API prioritizes simplicity, making our workflows easy to understand and alter. Each node executes clear functions, enhancing transparency and maintainability. Unlike overly complex frameworks, LangGraph aligns with our thinking and displays agent logic straightforwardly.

Reusable components are another strength of LangGraph. Nodes such as context collectors and validators are integral parts of multiple workflows, reducing redundancy and increasing efficiency. As we continue to develop specialized flows, the framework's modularity already yields significant productivity gains.

In short, LangGraph is a key player in our mission to deliver flexible, opinionated AI coding assistants. Join us in exploring these innovations on our Discord as we continue to push the boundaries of what's possible with AI in coding.

   - AI crawlers often mimic DDoS attacks, overwhelming servers with high-volume, distributed requests, leading to downtime for platforms like MIT Press and OAPEN.  

### 2. **Techniques and Evasion**  
   - AI companies use residential proxies, browser extensions, and malware-like tactics to mask scraping activities, bypassing IP blocks and rate-limiting.  
   - Examples include OpenAI’s alleged use of browser extensions to monitor traffic and services selling residential IP addresses to evade detection.  

### 3. **Defensive Challenges**  
   - Traditional defenses (CAPTCHAs, IP blocking) struggle against distributed, AI-driven bots. Tools like Cloudflare offer temporary relief but are not foolproof.  
   - Smaller sites lack resources to implement robust defenses, diverting developer time from innovation to bot mitigation.  

### 4. **Ethical and Systemic Concerns**  
   - Financial incentives drive companies to prioritize data extraction over ethical scraping, undermining open-access missions.  
   - BitTorrent is cited as a cooperative alternative, rewarding contributors and resisting centralized disruption, contrasting with AI’s exploitative model.  

### 5. **Solutions Proposed**  
   - **Technical**: Stricter API usage, JavaScript/CSS requirements (controversial for accessibility), and semantic web standards to structure data for fair access.  
   - **Legal**: Addressing SDKs/malware enabling botnets and blocking services facilitating abusive scraping.  
   - **Cultural**: Advocating for ethical guidelines and systemic shifts to prioritize sustainable, community-driven data access over profit-driven extraction.  

### 6. **Irony and Frustration**  
   - Many open-access platforms already offer APIs or feeds, rendering brute-force scraping unnecessary. The situation highlights contradictions in AI development’s reliance on public resources while undermining their viability.

### Angelina Jolie Was Right About Computers

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/angelina-jolie-was-right-about-risc-architecture/) | 15 points | by [vdupras](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vdupras) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43470248)

In an unexpected twist of cinematic prophecy, Angelina Jolie’s character in the 1995 film *Hackers* predicted the future of computer architecture. During a scene with Jonny Lee Miller, she mentions RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, stating it would "change everything." Fast-forward 28 years, and it turns out she wasn't wrong. RISC architecture, particularly in the form of RISC-V, is at the forefront of technological innovation, influencing everything from cars to AI systems.

Despite its growing influence, the RISC-V community is grappling with a peculiar challenge—they're faced with an industry that benefits immensely from their architecture but remains mostly oblivious to its intricacies. This was evident at the annual RISC-V summit in Santa Clara, where activists of this burgeoning tech movement mingled, exchanging complex jargon unfamiliar to the outside world.

Enter Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International, who is zealously ensuring that the organization's efforts not only propel technological advancements but also maintain relevance amid geopolitical tensions. Her confident address at the summit echoed Hackers' prescience, as she declared RISC-V's transformative impact on modern technology, making it a perfect testament to Jolie’s on-screen assertion.

However, as Redmond points out, the challenge remains that while RISC architecture is revolutionizing tech infrastructure, the average consumer is more concerned with functionality and cost-efficiency than the underlying architecture. As WIRED’s Jason says, it’s an untold story eagerly waiting to be shared, akin to a real-life, ongoing hacker saga that too few recognize for its futuristic foresight and current implications.

Thus, while the movie *Hackers* may have been ahead of its time, the tech it predicted is undeniably shaping our world today, even if unnoticed by many. The narrative around RISC and its promising future is unfolding quietly but distinctly, thanks in part to visionaries within the community and cinematic winks from the past.

The discussion revolves around the intersection of *Hackers*' prescient portrayal of RISC architecture and its real-world impact today, with several key points:  

1. **AI and Media**: Users note the irony of WIRED (owned by Condé Nast) covering RISC-V while its parent company uses OpenAI tools like ChatGPT for content. This sparks debate about AI's role in tech journalism and whether it aligns with the "hacker ethos" depicted in the film.  

2. **Industry Moves**: Commenters highlight leadership shifts, including Calista Redmond (RISC-V International CEO) and her prior role at Nvidia, alongside nods to executives like Doug Bowser (Nintendo) and Carol Surface (ex-Apple). These figures symbolize RISC-V’s growing influence across tech sectors.  

3. **Technical Nitpicking**: A user humorously critiques the *Hackers* scene, pointing out technical inaccuracies (e.g., PCI bus references, graphics performance) but acknowledges its symbolic foresight about rapid hardware innovation. David Patterson, a RISC pioneer, is mentioned as someone who might appreciate the film’s legacy despite its flaws.  

4. **Meta Commentary**: The discussion includes a link to an archived article (likely the WIRED piece) and a joke about paywalls, underscoring frustrations with access to tech journalism even as RISC-V’s story remains underrecognized.

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/devs-say-ai-crawlers-dominate-traffic-forcing-blocks-on-entire-countries/) | 341 points | by [LinuxBender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=LinuxBender) | [249 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43476337)

In a compelling narrative that has the tech community buzzing, software developer Xe Iaso shared their struggle against relentless AI crawlers wreaking havoc on their Git repository service. Despite deploying standard defenses like robots.txt and blocking certain user-agents, Iaso found these bots sidestepping every measure, leading to repeated service disruptions. Frustrated, Iaso introduced "Anubis," a unique proof-of-work system that challenges browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site.

Unfortunately, Iaso’s battle is not isolated. Their plight sheds light on a broader crisis within the open source community, which is being inundated with bot traffic that mimics distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. An alarming report by LibreNews highlighted that some projects see upwards of 97% of their traffic from AI company bots, causing service instability, driving up bandwidth costs, and taxing already overburdened maintainers. 

Projects like Fedora Pagure and GNOME have taken extreme measures, such as blocking whole countries or adopting Iaso's Anubis system. However, these solutions sometimes lead to significant delays for legitimate users, frustrating those who face up to two-minute waits to access shared links.

Open source initiatives, crucial for public collaboration and operated with limited resources, now grapple with AI crawlers that flagrantly ignore standard web protocols, evade detection, and sap both technical and financial resources. Martin Owens of the Inkscape project lamented this "prodigious block list" caused by AI companies disrespecting existing guidelines.

Commentary on Hacker News about Iaso's fight reflects widespread developer anger towards what many see as predatory practices by AI firms, indifferent to the goodwill essential in open source environments. This tension is exacerbated as some open source projects handle costly AI-generated traffic that surfloads system resources, making it particularly brutal for repositories like SourceHut and the Curl project.

The grim reality is that these AI crawls not only drain financial resources but also waste developers' time with fake bug reports, revealing a growing disconnect between AI companies and the community-driven ethos of open source development. As the community seeks solutions, a call for more ethical behavior and respect from AI companies is growing louder.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Xe Iaso's battle with AI crawlers reflects a mix of technical debate, shared frustration, and creative solutions. Key themes include:

1. **Bypassing Traditional Defenses**: Users noted AI crawlers easily circumvent standard tools like `robots.txt` and user-agent blocking (e.g., Huawei’s PetalBot ignoring restrictions). Some suggested using invisible hyperlinks to trap bots, though concerns about accessibility for screen readers were raised.

2. **Rate-Limiting Challenges**: Strategies like IP-based rate-limiting were criticized for being impractical, as AI traffic often mimics human patterns (e.g., low requests per IP). Blocking entire IP ranges (e.g., Huawei’s Singapore mobile network) was shared as a drastic measure, but risks overblocking legitimate users.

3. **Proof-of-Work Systems**: Anubis, a proof-of-work system requiring computational puzzles for access, was highlighted as a novel deterrent. While praised for slowing bots, concerns about its impact on user experience (e.g., delays) and client-side processing overhead were discussed. Alternatives like bcrypt-style hashing or encrypted content layers were also proposed.

4. **Ethical and Resource Strain**: Many lamented AI companies’ disregard for open-source community norms, as their crawlers drain resources (bandwidth, maintenance time) and generate fake issues. Some endorsed “data poisoning” to sabotage AI training sets as a retaliatory measure.

5. **Technical Workarounds**: Users shared mitigations like using Cloudflare, caching, or serving static content to reduce server load. However, these were seen as partial fixes, with calls for AI firms to adopt ethical scraping practices.

6. **Off-Topic Divergence**: A flagged thread veered into debates about anime’s societal impact, illustrating how discussions occasionally strayed from the core issue.

The overarching sentiment was frustration with AI companies exploiting open-source ecosystems, coupled with a demand for balanced, community-respecting solutions.

### Improving recommendation systems and search in the age of LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://eugeneyan.com/writing/recsys-llm/) | 384 points | by [7d7n](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=7d7n) | [91 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43450732)

In the ever-evolving world of recommendation systems and search, the integration of large language models (LLMs) and multimodal content is transforming traditional practices. Historically grounded in language modeling, these systems have transitioned from utilizing Word2vec for embedding-based retrieval to adopting LLM-assisted models like GRUs, Transformers, and BERT for ranking. This article by Eugen Yan dives into how industrial search and recommendation architectures have been revolutionized over the past year by LLM advancements and a unified framework approach.

Key highlights include the adoption of LLM and multimodality-augmented architectures to overcome the limitations of ID-based systems. Hybrid models now incorporate both content understanding and behavioral modeling to address common challenges such as cold-start and long-tail item recommendations. For instance, YouTube's Semantic IDs use a two-stage framework with a transformer-based video encoder to craft dense content embeddings. These embeddings are compressed into Semantic IDs via a Residual Quantization Variational AutoEncoder (RQ-VAE). The system notably improves efficiency by using compact semantic IDs in a production-scale ranking model instead of traditional high-dimensional embeddings.

Industry models like M3CSR (Kuaishou) further exemplify innovation by forming multimodal content embeddings through visual, textual, and audio means, clustered into trainable category IDs. This dual-tower architecture optimizes online inference by using precomputed user and item embeddings, which are indexed for quick retrieval using approximate nearest neighbor techniques. This setup allows static content embeddings to adapt effectively to behavioral alignment, achieving enhanced recommendation accuracy and boosted user engagement.

The FLIP model from Huawei explores aligning ID-based recommendation systems with LLMs through simultaneous learning from masked tabular and language data, offering another angle on merging modalities for robust recommendation systems.

Results from these methods are significant; YouTube's Semantic IDs, for instance, yield better performance in cold-start scenarios compared to previous random hash methods, while M3CSR shows superior results over leading multimodal baselines, proven by an increase in user engagement metrics like clicks, likes, and follows. Collectively, these advancements paint a picture of recommendation systems gradually morphing, fueled by the synergy between LLMs and multimodal data.

The Hacker News discussion on the integration of LLMs and multimodal approaches in recommendation systems highlights several key themes:

1. **User Experiences with Platforms**:  
   - Users reported mixed experiences with platforms like **Spotify** and **Apple Music**. Some praised Spotify’s improved search for handling complex queries (e.g., longer, exploratory intents), while others criticized its inconsistency, noting failures to find specific content (e.g., band names or niche playlists). A user switched to Apple Music due to frustration with Spotify’s search prioritizing public playlists over personal libraries.  
   - **Cold-start and engagement challenges** were acknowledged, with examples like YouTube’s Semantic IDs improving recommendations for new content and Kuaishou’s M3CSR boosting user engagement metrics (clicks, likes).

2. **Technical Insights**:  
   - **Hybrid models** (e.g., combining content embeddings with behavioral data) and **LLM-driven query expansion** (e.g., Doc2Query) were discussed as effective strategies. Users highlighted the efficiency of compact semantic IDs and vector search libraries for real-time performance.  
   - Debates arose around **practical implementation**: Some argued that non-LLM approaches (e.g., Word2Vec, ANN) remain cost-effective for certain tasks, while others emphasized LLMs’ potential for contextual understanding.

3. **Critiques of Academic Writing**:  
   - The article was praised as a comprehensive survey but criticized for **overly technical jargon**, making it inaccessible to non-experts. Participants debated the balance between rigor and readability, with some noting that surveys should prioritize clarity to aid practitioners.

4. **Privacy and Practical Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism emerged about **LLM-based search tools on smartphones**, with concerns over privacy (e.g., data scraping, ads) and resource demands. Companies like Apple and Google were seen as key players in balancing performance with user trust.  
   - Metrics vs. UX: Users cautioned against over-reliance on engagement metrics (e.g., click rates) without addressing qualitative feedback, citing examples like Organic Maps’ success in prioritizing user complaints.

**Notable Examples**:  
- **Semantic IDs** (YouTube) and **M3CSR** (Kuaishou) were cited as successful innovations.  
- Tools like **Elicit** were mentioned for refining research questions via LLMs, though limitations in direct implementation were noted.  

Overall, the discussion reflects optimism about LLMs’ transformative potential but underscores the need for **user-centric design**, accessibility in technical communication, and pragmatic balancing of new and traditional methods.

### Bitter Lesson is about AI agents

#### [Submission URL](https://ankitmaloo.com/bitter-lesson/) | 131 points | by [ankit219](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ankit219) | [92 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43451742)

In the world of AI, where compute power reigns supreme, the traditional belief in meticulously engineered solutions is giving way to a philosophy where more is more. This change in perspective is rooted in a critical insight from Richard Sutton's 2019 essay ‘The Bitter Lesson,’ which underscores that, in AI, raw computational power outperforms intricate human-designed systems consistently. It's like preparing for a marathon: meticulous preparation and gear might help, but nothing substitutes for actual running—just as compute cycles drive AI excellence.

The realization that AI models improve vastly when given ample computation resonates with the way nature works. Like plants that thrive with basic essentials (sunlight, water, nutrients) rather than micromanaged conditions, effective AI systems flourish when allowed to explore and adapt independently.

Take customer support AI as an example, which has seen varying approaches: The rule-based systems initially used were bogged down by complex, maintenance-heavy decision trees. Limited-compute agents marked an improvement but still required human oversight due to their inability to handle complex queries efficiently.

Enter the scale-out solution, which leverages enhanced computational resources. This involves running multiple reasoning paths and generating parallel responses, allowing the system to tackle unforeseen edge cases and discover efficient interaction patterns. While this approach is computationally intense, it delivers far superior results by providing AI the freedom to innovate.

Looking to the future, the Reinforcement Learning (RL) revolution is reshaping this landscape further. By enabling models to learn through a trial-and-error process, RL agents break free from predefined programs. They develop novel problem-solving methods, reflecting the adaptability of learning to ride a bike through practice rather than reading a manual. As post-training RL compute investment grows, the ability of AI to discover groundbreaking solutions becomes evident, surpassing the capabilities of models confined by human-crafted wrappers.

As AI engineers forge ahead, understanding and embracing the 'bitter lesson' is crucial. Rather than scripting rigid workflows, they must harness abundant compute power to enable their AI systems to learn dynamically and discover innovative solutions. This shift promises transformative potential across various domains, heralding an era where exploration triumphs over rigid, handcrafted systems, ultimately leading to smarter, more adaptive AI.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around Richard Sutton's "bitter lesson" — the idea that scaling computational power and simple algorithms often outperforms human-engineered complexity in AI. Here's a concise summary of the key points:

### **Support for the Bitter Lesson**
- **Raw Compute Triumphs**: Participants agree that large models (e.g., LLMs) succeed despite random architectures and hyperparameters, emphasizing that brute-force compute allows models to bypass local minima and discover solutions.  
- **Critique of Handcrafted Systems**: Handcrafted features or domain-specific algorithms are seen as limiting, as they impose human biases and restrict optimization. Generic function approximators (like neural networks) are more flexible.  
- **Hardware Scaling**: Some argue that Moore’s Law-like improvements (even if slowing) still enable progress, with multi-threaded and specialized tasks (e.g., particle simulations) showing gains despite single-thread stagnation.

### **Counterarguments and Nuances**
- **Practical Limits of Compute**: Critics highlight challenges like the exorbitant cost of training (e.g., $100k for GPT-2-style models), reliance on luck (e.g., random seeds), and diminishing returns as hardware hits memory/bandwidth limits.  
- **Algorithmic Efficiency Matters**: Some stress that the bitter lesson isn’t just about compute but favoring *polynomial-time algorithms* over exponential ones. Efficient algorithms, not just scale, drive long-term progress.  
- **Human Ingenuity Still Relevant**: While LLMs scale compute, they often fail at simple tasks (e.g., following JSON schemas), suggesting a role for hybrid approaches that balance automation with human oversight.

### **Hardware Debates**
- **Moore’s Law "Death"**: Participants debate whether CPU improvements have stalled, with some noting single-thread performance plateaus and others pointing to gains in multi-core systems, GPUs, and specialized workloads.  
- **Real-World Benchmarks**: New CPUs (e.g., AMD’s Zen) show modest generational gains (~10-20%), far from the exponential growth of earlier decades, though niche tasks (e.g., simulations) still benefit from parallelism.

### **Meta-Criticism**
- **Post Quality**: The original blog post is dismissed by some as low-effort or ChatGPT-generated, sparking broader concerns about content quality on HN.  
- **Practicality vs. Theory**: A few argue that the bitter lesson overlooks real-world constraints (e.g., CPU-only environments), where efficient code and clever algorithms remain valuable.

### **Takeaway**
The discussion reflects a tension between two camps: those advocating for relentless scaling of compute and those emphasizing algorithmic efficiency and hybrid human-AI collaboration. While the bitter lesson is influential, its application faces practical hurdles like costs, hardware limits, and the need for interpretability. The path forward likely lies in balancing scale with innovation in both algorithms and hardware.

### IBM's CEO doesn't think AI will replace programmers anytime soon

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/11/ibms-ceo-doesnt-think-ai-will-replace-programmers-anytime-soon/) | 60 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43452421)

At the latest SXSW conference, IBM CEO Arvind Krishna offered some intriguing insights into the future of AI and global trade. Contrary to some forecasts, Krishna doesn't foresee AI replacing programmers in the near future, suggesting that AI could contribute to writing 20-30% of code rather than 90% as predicted by others. Instead, he views AI as a tool that enhances programmer productivity and quality rather than replacing jobs. Reflecting on the broader geopolitical stage, Krishna remains a strong proponent of global trade, emphasizing the need for international talent to fuel U.S. economic growth. In this vein, Krishna advocates for policies that make the U.S. an international talent hub, despite calls for stricter visa restrictions.

Additionally, Krishna shared his belief that quantum computing, not AI, will pave the way for new scientific discoveries. While AI leverages existing knowledge, he sees quantum computing as the frontier for accelerating innovative breakthroughs. His views mark a departure from OpenAI’s Sam Altman, who is optimistic about the emergence of superintelligent AI in the near future. Krishna also touched on the energy efficiency of AI, predicting significant reductions as models become more compact, referring to the advancements of Chinese startup DeepSeek.

In summary, while Krishna acknowledges AI’s transformative role, he underscores its complementary nature in enhancing current capabilities rather than overseeing a technological upheaval.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding IBM CEO Arvind Krishna’s views on AI in programming reveals a mix of skepticism, practical insights, and debates on AI’s role in software development:

1. **AI as a Productivity Tool, Not a Replacement**:  
   Many commenters agreed with Krishna’s stance that AI (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) augments programmers but doesn’t replace them. Users shared experiences where AI accelerates boilerplate code, debugging, or repetitive tasks (e.g., VPN setup, React component tweaks), but emphasized that critical thinking and deep system understanding remain human strengths. Some compared AI to "fancy autocomplete" that reduces tedium but lacks problem-solving intuition.

2. **Skepticism Toward Extreme Predictions**:  
   While Anthropic’s CEO claims 90% of code could soon be AI-generated, commenters were doubtful. They argued metrics like "90% of code volume" might reflect trivial boilerplate, not meaningful logic. Others noted that even partial automation could lead to *more* code (Jevons Paradox) rather than fewer developers. Practical examples highlighted AI catching subtle bugs in SPI hardware interactions, but skeptics questioned whether LLMs could handle complex architectures or edge cases.

3. **Shift in Developer Roles, Not Elimination**:  
   Some suggested AI might phase out *junior* roles but warned of long-term consequences: losing mentorship pipelines and overloading senior engineers. Others countered that automation could free developers to focus on higher-value work, though corporate cost-cutting might prioritize headcount reductions over quality.

4. **Criticism of IBM’s Relevance**:  
   IBM was criticized as a "classic enterprise" lagging behind startups in AI innovation. Commenters dismissed Krishna’s remarks as cautious and out of touch, contrasting them with startups aggressively integrating AI into products. However, some defended his broader points about global trade and quantum computing’s potential.

5. **Mixed Practical Success Stories**:  
   Users shared examples of AI solving niche technical challenges—reconfiguring VPNs, debugging SPI commands—that saved hours of manual work. Others praised AI for automating blog styling or code refactoring. Yet, limitations were clear: AI often generates verbose, low-quality code or struggles with context-heavy tasks.

**Takeaway**: The consensus leans toward AI as a transformative *tool* for developers, not a job-killer. However, its impact depends on how organizations balance automation with nurturing technical expertise. Krishna’s moderate stance contrasts with more bullish industry claims, reflecting a pragmatic view of AI’s near-term role.
