### AGENTS.md outperforms skills in our agent evals

#### [Submission URL](https://vercel.com/blog/agents-md-outperforms-skills-in-our-agent-evals) | 432 points | by [maximedupre](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=maximedupre) | [169 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46809708)

AGENTS.md outperforms “skills” for teaching agents Next.js 16

TL;DR
- Embedding a tiny, version-pinned docs index directly in AGENTS.md beat tool-based “skills” by a wide margin in Next.js 16 tasks.
- Results: 53% baseline → 53% with a skill (unused) → 79% with carefully worded “use the skill” instructions → 100% with an 8KB docs index in AGENTS.md.
- Biggest culprit: models don’t reliably invoke tools, and behavior is fragile to prompt phrasing. Persistent context wins.

What they tested
- Goal: Give coding agents accurate, version-matched framework knowledge because training data lags.
- Stack: Next.js 16 features not in model training data, including connection(), 'use cache', cacheLife()/cacheTag(), forbidden()/unauthorized(), proxy.ts, async cookies()/headers(), after(), updateTag(), refresh().
- Hardened evals: behavior-based tests, no leakage, retries to control variance.

Key findings
- Skills often weren’t triggered: in 56% of runs the agent never invoked the Next.js docs skill, yielding no gain over baseline.
- Instruction fragility: “You MUST invoke the skill” pushed the model to over-anchor on docs and miss project context; “Explore the project first, then invoke the skill” performed better, hitting 79%.
- Remove the decision, win the task: An 8KB compressed docs index baked into AGENTS.md (persistent on every turn) hit 100% on the eval suite. No tool call required, no prompt gymnastics.

Why AGENTS.md worked better
- Zero tool-use uncertainty: the model doesn’t have to decide to fetch docs.
- Consistent, always-on context: keeps the agent anchored to the correct Next.js version and APIs.
- Small, curated index beats sprawling docs: a compact map of APIs, patterns, and pitfalls minimized confusion and hallucinations.

How to replicate for your Next.js repo
- Create a compact docs index (≈5–10KB): list key APIs, minimal usage snippets, versioned notes, common gotchas, and links to full docs.
- Pin versions clearly at the top (e.g., “Project on Next.js 16.x; prefer 'use cache', connection(), forbidden(), etc.”).
- Put it in AGENTS.md (or CLAUDE.md for Claude Code) at repo root so agents see it every turn.
- Instruction tip: Ask agents to “explore the project first, then use the docs index as reference.”
- Maintain it: update on framework upgrades; keep it concise to preserve token budget.

Caveats and notes
- May not scale linearly across huge, multi-framework codebases; consider per-package AGENTS.md or slim indexes per domain.
- Persistent context can over-anchor; ensure the index points to project constraints (env, routing, config) and not just generic patterns.
- Tool ecosystems may improve invocation reliability over time, but today’s models still miss tools without careful prompting.

Bottom line
If you need reliable, version-correct Next.js 16 code from an agent today, a small, curated AGENTS.md beats a fancy skill. Remove the decision to “go get the docs,” give the model the right context up front, and your pass rates jump.

Based on the comments, here is a summary of the discussion:

**Context vs. Tool Use (The "Why" it Works)**
The primary technical discussion revolved around why a passive text file (`AGENTS.md`) outperforms active "skills" (tools).
*   **Passive vs. Active:** Users noted that "Skills" require the model to make a decision to function—it must realize it needs help and choose to invoke a tool. `AGENTS.md` provides **passive context**, bypassing the decision-making process entirely.
*   **Model Nature:** Commenters argued that LLMs are fundamentally text generators, not agents trained via Reinforcement Learning (RL) to reliably trigger tools. One creates a "decision point" failure; the other relies on the model's core strength: following the provided context window.
*   **Prompt Engineering:** Some speculated that "Skills" implementations might use smaller, faster models (like Claude Haiku) to filter context before passing it to the main model, leading to data loss. `AGENTS.md` forces the raw context into the prompt, ensuring the smart model sees it.

**AI Behavior and "The Turing Test"**
*   **RTFM:** A humorous sub-thread emerged regarding the finding that agents failed to invoke the documentation tool in 56% of runs. Users joked this proves the AI passes the Turing Test, as "not reading the manual" (RTFM) is a distinctly human trait.
*   **Future of HN:** This spiraled into a meta-joke about a future Hacker News populated entirely by bots posting code they didn't write, commenting on posts they didn't read, and scolding each other about guidelines.

**LLMs vs. Junior Developers**
There was a debate comparing current agents to human junior developers:
*   **Reliability:** Some argued that while LLMs are prone to hallucinations and "confident lying" (described by one user as "sociopathic" lack of shame), they are superior to humans in that they are tireless, have no ego, and can be "reset" endlessly to fix behavior—something impossible with human employees.
*   **Harnessing:** Users suggested that even if raw model intelligence plateaus, performance gains (like those in the article) will come from better "harnesses"—structuring how context and tasks are fed to the model rather than expecting the model to figure it out alone.

### Claude Code daily benchmarks for degradation tracking

#### [Submission URL](https://marginlab.ai/trackers/claude-code/) | 726 points | by [qwesr123](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qwesr123) | [337 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46810282)

Independent tracker flags a statistically significant 30-day drop in Claude Code Opus 4.5 on SWE tasks

An unaffiliated group is publishing a daily, “what-you-see-is-what-you-get” benchmark of Claude Code (Opus 4.5) using the Claude Code CLI on a curated, contamination-resistant subset of SWE-Bench-Pro. The goal: catch real-world regressions like those Anthropic documented in its Sept 2025 degradation postmortem.

Key numbers (last updated Jan 30, 2026):
- Baseline reference pass rate: 58%
- Daily: 56% over 50 evals (−2.0%, not significant; needs ±14% for p<0.05)
- 7-day: 54% over 250 evals (−4.4%, not significant; needs ±5.6%)
- 30-day: 54% over 705 evals (−4.0%, statistically significant; threshold ±3.2%)

Methodology highlights:
- Runs the current Claude Code release with the SOTA model (Opus 4.5) directly—no custom harness—so results reflect what users see and capture both model and toolchain changes.
- Treats each task as Bernoulli; reports 95% CIs and flags p<0.05 drops across daily, weekly, and monthly windows.
- Small daily N (50) means noisy single-day swings; the 30-day aggregate is more reliable.

You can subscribe for email alerts when a statistically significant degradation is detected.

**Independent tracker flags a statistically significant 30-day drop in Claude Code Opus 4.5 on SWE tasks**
An independent group using a localized benchmark of SWE-Bench-Pro reported a statistically significant 4.0% drop in Claude Code’s performance over a 30-day period. Unlike standard benchmarks, this tracker uses the actual Claude Code CLI to capture toolchain regressions.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion was highlighted by an immediate response from the Claude Code team and a technical deep-dive into the tool's surprisingly heavy architecture.

*   **Official Response & Fix:** A member of the Claude Code team (`trq_`) acknowledged the report and confirmed the degradation was caused by a "harness issue" introduced in version 1.2.6. They stated the change was rolled back in version 1.2.8 and advised users to update immediately.
*   **Architecture & Performance:** A major sub-thread emerged regarding why the Claude Code CLI consumes high CPU/GPU resources (reportedly hitting 100% CPU or 10% GPU usage just to render text).
    *   Commenters identified that the TUI appears to be built using a React pipeline that rasterizes layouts to a 2D screen concept and diffs them to generate ANSI sequences, essentially running a "game engine" loop at ~60fps to render terminal text.
    *   Critics called this typical "AI-generated code bloat" and "over-complexity," contrasting it with efficient TUI libraries like Bubble Tea or Ratatui.
*   **Context & UX Bugs:** Users discussed specific regressions, notably a UI change where the default behavior for "Exit Plan" mode switched from "Proceed" to "Clear Context & Proceed." This caused the model to dump its memory of the codebase, forcing it to replan or produce lower-quality code. Others noted severe bugs, including the agent ignoring "do not deploy" instructions and hallucinating terminal commands.
*   **Billing & Trust:** Several users expressed frustration regarding wasted tokens caused by these bugs. While one user reported receiving a refund, others claimed Anthropic refused refunds for API costs incurred during these breaking changes, fueling a debate about the ethics of "silent fixes" versus public postmortems.

### Moltworker: a self-hosted personal AI agent, minus the minis

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/moltworker-self-hosted-ai-agent/) | 221 points | by [ghostwriternr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ghostwriternr) | [65 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46810828)

TL;DR: Cloudflare built “Moltworker,” a way to run the popular self-hosted personal AI agent Moltbot (now OpenClaw) on Cloudflare’s platform—no dedicated hardware needed. It uses Workers as the entrypoint, Sandboxes for isolated agent runtime, Browser Rendering for headless automation, R2 for storage, and AI Gateway for model routing, billing, and analytics.

What’s new
- Hardware-free deployment: Instead of a home Mac mini, spin up Moltbot on Cloudflare’s Workers + Sandboxes stack, remotely controlled via your chat app.
- Architecture: 
  - An entrypoint Worker (API router/proxy) with Cloudflare Access protection and an admin UI.
  - A Sandbox container runs the standard Moltbot gateway and integrations.
  - R2 provides persistent object storage.
  - Browser Rendering enables Playwright-powered web automation.
- AI Gateway integration:
  - Bring Your Own Key or Unified Billing (top up credits; Cloudflare pays providers).
  - One env var (ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL) points Moltbot to Gateway—no code changes.
  - Centralized logs, cost visibility, model switching and fallbacks without redeploys; supports multiple providers, not just Anthropic.

Why it matters
- Low-ops personal agent: Makes always-on, integrated assistants accessible without managing a box at home.
- Security and scale: Isolated Sandboxes, global edge network, Access controls.
- Portability: Cloudflare’s growing native Node.js support reduces hacks and widens library compatibility.

Notable details
- Node.js compatibility has improved enough to run Playwright using node:fs instead of memfs.
- Internal experiment: Of the top 1,000 npm packages (excluding CLIs/build tools/browser-only), only ~1.5% didn’t work in Workers.
- Rename: Moltbot has been renamed to OpenClaw as of Jan 30, 2026.

What HN may debate
- Trade-offs vs truly self-hosted hardware (privacy, cost, vendor lock-in, egress).
- Sandbox limits, cold starts, and long-running tasks.
- Cost transparency vs a single Mac mini over time.
- Depth of multi-model support and how smooth provider/model switching is in practice.

**Daily Digest: Moltworker & The Cloud-Hosted AI Agent Debate**

**The Story:** Cloudflare has introduced "Moltworker," an architecture for running the popular open-source AI agent Moltbot (recently renamed OpenClaw) directly on their network. Traditionally, users self-hosted this agent on local hardware like a Mac mini to handle tasks. Moltworker removes the hardware requirement by leveraging Cloudflare Workers (entry point), Sandboxes (isolated runtime), R2 (storage), and Browser Rendering (automation). The setup promises a low-ops, secure, and always-on personal assistant manageable via chat apps.

**The Discussion:**
The Hacker News comment section was highly skeptical, focusing on security risks, accusations of artificial hype, and the trade-offs between cloud and local hosting.

**Key themes from the discussion:**

*   **Security Nightmares & Prompt Injection:** The most prominent concern was security. Commenters described giving an AI agent full file system and network access as a "ticking time bomb" and a "supply chain attack waiting to happen."
    *   User *dvnklly* noted a fundamental issue: unlike hacked systems that throw errors, agents are non-deterministic; a compromised agent might fail silently or subtly, making debugging difficult.
    *   Others pointed out that simple prompt injection could trick the agent into malicious actions, particularly when the agent has broad permissions (e.g., email or shell access).

*   **Hype vs. Utility:** A significant portion of the discussion dismissed the project as "astroturfed" marketing.
    *   Critics argued the tool is essentially a "convenience wrapper" for existing LLMs (like Claude or ChatGPT) and that the hype outweighs the innovation.
    *   There were accusations regarding the project leadership's association with "scammy memecoins" and name-sniping, though others defended the founder as a legitimate developer with a previous 9-figure exit building tools for fun.

*   **Cloudflare Platform Capabilities:** On a technical level, some users praised Cloudflare's progress with Node.js compatibility in Workers, noting that packages like Playwright (headless browser) now run natively without complex hacks. However, observers pointed out that even the demo deployments appeared to have insecure defaults (e.g., publicly accessible dashboards).

*   **Local vs. Cloud Trade-offs:** The debate contrasted the "Moltworker" approach with true self-hosting.
    *   **Pro-Local:** Users argued that local hardware (Mac mini/HomeLab) remains superior for privacy and data sovereignty. Local agents also have lower latency for smart home control.
    *   **Pro-Cloud:** Supporters noted that cloud agents offer better bandwidth for web-scraping tasks and remove the maintenance cost of running a VPS or home server.

*   **Alternatives:** Users flagged that similar functionality exists in tools like "Claude Code" or by simply running scripts on a locked-down Hetzner VPS via Tailscale, questioning the need for a specialized "agent" platform that introduces vendor lock-in.

### AI’s impact on engineering jobs may be different than expected

#### [Submission URL](https://semiengineering.com/ais-impact-on-engineering-jobs-may-be-different-than-initial-projections/) | 116 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [207 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46813834)

TL;DR: AI is likely to wipe out many repetitive entry-level tasks in chip and systems design, but that may let new grads trained on AI-era tools start higher on the ladder. Domain expertise and systems thinking still matter; mid-level roles may feel the squeeze most.

Highlights:
- Force multiplier, not a replacement: AI excels at high-dimensional optimization and grunt work, accelerating junior engineers’ ramp-up rather than making seasoned judgment obsolete.
- Two playbooks emerging:
  - Augment the existing workflow: drop AI into current processes to fill headcount gaps and speed throughput.
  - Rearchitect the workflow: redesign around AI’s strengths, automating more steps and changing how problems are framed.
- Seniority is bifurcating:
  - Tool-deep seniors (masters of low-level toolchains) are more replaceable by higher-level abstractions.
  - System-level seniors (owning tradeoffs, project orchestration, failure modes) remain critical and harder to automate.
- Pipeline paradox addressed: Even as junior grunt work shrinks, students trained on modern, higher-abstraction tools can contribute faster; AI co-pilots help them climb the curve without a decade of toil.
- Non-negotiables: domain knowledge, critical thinking, and “sanity checks” over AI outputs.

Why it matters:
- Talent shortage means teams will prioritize engineers who can wield AI and rethink flows, not just run legacy tools.
- Expect hiring to skew toward AI-fluent new grads and system thinkers; mid-level “implementation” roles may be most disrupted.
- Curricula and bootcamps will continue shifting up the abstraction stack; fewer people will go deep, but that deep expertise remains strategically valuable.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**The "Unlimited Developer" Fallacy**
Discussion opened with a debate on the economic implications of AI efficiency. User `wrmdck` argued against mass layoffs, suggesting that if AI makes developers 10x more productive, companies won't cut staff to save money; they will utilize the surplus capacity to pile on features and out-compete rivals effectively. However, others pointed out that "writing code" is rarely the bottleneck in large tech companies. As `pwrnr` and `ThrowawayB7` noted, giants like Google and Microsoft already effectively have unlimited engineering resources, yet still release subpar products (like MS Teams) due to failures in product management, design, and taste—problems AI coders cannot solve.

**Skill Amplification vs. Replacement**
A strong consensus formed around `Swizec`’s assertion that AI acts as an amplifier: "If you are good, you get great results faster. If you represent bad [practices], you get bad results faster."
*   **The Competence Trap:** User `prryg` validated this with personal experience; when using AI for a language they knew well, it was a "flawless" productivity boost. When using it for an unfamiliar language (TypeScript), it generated "garbage" they couldn't validate, proving that underlying domain theory is essential to direct the tools.
*   **DORA Metrics:** `kd` highlighted the DORA 2025 report, which suggests teams with strong quality controls are seeing higher velocity with AI, while teams with weak processes are simply experiencing elevated failure and outage rates.

**The "Model Developer" of 2030**
Participants speculated on what the daily workflow will look like a decade from now. `drctvlv` raised structural concerns:
*   **Maintenance Nightmares:** If AI generates massive volumes of "low-context" code to solve problems, who is responsible for refactoring or understanding the failure modes?
*   **The Education Gap:** `SecretDreams` worried about a "K-shaped" curve where established seniors benefit, but juniors (deprived of the "grunt work" that builds intuition) fail to develop the reasoning skills necessary to verify AI output.

**Tool Consistency and Frustration**
There was significant friction regarding the reliability of current LLMs. `9rx` expressed exhaustion with the "stochastic parrot" nature of the tools—prompts that worked perfectly yesterday might fail today, leading to wasted time fighting the model independently of skill level. While `czz` argued this is a prompting/throttling issue (suggesting users treat AI like "government contractors" with extremely rigid specifications), `trwy` critiqued this mindset, noting that when tools act unpredictably, "you're prompting wrong" has become a condescending dismissal of legitimate instability in the software stack.

### Playing Board Games with Deep Convolutional Neural Network on 8bit Motorola 6809

#### [Submission URL](https://ipsj.ixsq.nii.ac.jp/records/229345) | 41 points | by [mci](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mci) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46810337)

Playing Board Games with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network on the Motorola 6809 8-Bit Microprocessor (paper)
Link: https://ipsj.ixsq.nii.ac.jp/records/229345

Rémi Coulom shows a Go-playing convolutional neural network running entirely on a Motorola 6809—an 8-bit CPU from 1978—implemented on a Thomson MO5 microcomputer. The work focuses on inference only (training done elsewhere) and leans on techniques like quantization to fit and execute the model under extreme memory and compute constraints. Despite the hardware, the program reportedly plays on par with GNU Go, underscoring how far careful optimization can push ML inference on tiny, retro hardware. Open-access, short GPWS 2023 paper (4 pages).

**Playing Board Games with a Deep Convolutional Neural Network on the Motorola 6809**
The discussion shifted focus from the neural network implementation to a nostalgic technical analysis of the **Motorola 6809** processor itself, with users celebrating its design while debating the historical reasons for its market placement.

*   **Architecture & Design:** Commenters praised the 6809 as an "elegant" improvement over contemporaries like the Z80 and 6502. Users noted that while it was an 8-bit bus, it featured significant 16-bit internal features (arithmetic, registers) and an "orthogonal" instruction set that made writing assembly code pleasant compared to x86. One user highlighted that the architecture was robust enough to support *OS-9*, a multi-tasking, UNIX-like operating system.
*   **Historical Context:** The thread explored Motorola's strategic missteps, specifically the decision to segment the market with incompatible ISAs (the 6809 for low-end and 68000 for high-end), contrasting this with Intel's successful backward-compatibility strategy with the 8086/8088.
*   **Longevity & Variants:** Trivia shared included the chip's surprising longevity (powering pinball machines like *The Simpsons Pinball Party* as late as 2003) and the existence of the Hitachi 6309, a faster, unofficial CMOS variant.
*   **The 6502 Connection:** Users recounted the industry history regarding the rival MOS 6502, noting it was created by engineers who defected from Motorola after management refused to lower the price of the preceding 6800 chip.

### Agent-shell: A native Emacs buffer to interact with LLM agents powered by ACP

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/xenodium/agent-shell) | 31 points | by [trelane](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trelane) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46815899)

What it is
- A native Emacs shell/buffer for chatting with LLM “agents,” all via the Agent Client Protocol (ACP). Think LSP-like interoperability, but for AI agents.
- Built on Emacs’ comint via shell-maker; available on MELPA. GPL-3.0. ~570 stars.

Why it matters
- One Emacs UI for many agents: swap models/tools without changing your workflow.
- Keyboard-first, reproducible buffers with history, diffing, and Emacs extensibility.
- Growing ecosystem: manager, sidebar, code-review UI, attention tracker, and more.

Supported agents (via their ACP CLIs)
- Claude Code (claude-code-acp), Google Gemini CLI (--experimental-acp), Auggie, Mistral Vibe, Goose, Cursor, Qwen Code, Factory Droid, Pi, plus OpenAI Codex (codex-acp).
- Just install each agent’s CLI and ensure it’s in PATH.

Getting started
- Install from MELPA (use-package agent-shell). Doom users: package! shell-maker, acp, agent-shell.
- Configure env vars per agent with agent-shell-make-environment-variables; optionally inherit your Emacs env (:inherit-env t).
- Launch an agent-specific shell and chat/code inside Emacs. There’s a YouTube demo in the README.

State of the project
- Actively developed (recent 0.25/0.17 updates), with GitHub Sponsors call for support.

Bottom line
If you live in Emacs and want a unified, editor-native way to work with multiple LLM agents, agent-shell offers a clean, ACP-based path with a growing set of integrations and add-ons.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around workflow preferences and comparisons to other editor integrations:

*   **Shell vs. Org-Mode:** A significant portion of the conversation contrasts the "shell" approach with using **gptel** inside `org-mode` (specifically `org-roam`). One user argues that keeping chats in plain text files offers better persistence, context management (using headlines to scope context), and privacy (via GPG encryption) compared to ephemeral shell buffers.
*   **Deeper Integration:** Users mentioned **claude-code.el** as an alternative that might offer deeper integration than a generic shell wrapper, specifically the ability to define custom MCP tools that run Emacs commands directly.
*   **Neovim & MCP Parallels:** A Neovim user compared `agent-shell` to **mcp-nvim-server**, noting how powerful it is to give LLMs direct access to editor state (open files/splits). They praised the "compose buffer" input style shown in the `agent-shell` demo, expressing a wish for similar "selection-to-compose-buffer" mechanics in the Neovim ecosystem.

### Apple buys Israeli startup Q.ai

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/29/apple-buys-israeli-startup-q-ai-as-the-ai-race-heats-up/) | 123 points | by [ishener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ishener) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46816228)

Apple buys Israeli AI startup Q.ai for nearly $2B to bolster on-device audio and vision tech

- Apple has acquired Q.ai, an Israeli imaging and machine-learning startup focused on interpreting whispered speech and enhancing audio in noisy environments, Reuters reports. The Financial Times pegs the deal at nearly $2B, Apple’s second-largest after Beats in 2014.
- The tech lines up with Apple’s hardware-centric AI push: smarter AirPods (Apple added live translation last year) and richer multimodal signals for Vision Pro, including tech to detect subtle facial muscle activity.
- It’s a reunion: Q.ai CEO Aviad Maizels previously sold PrimeSense to Apple in 2013, whose depth-sensing tech helped pave the way from Touch ID to Face ID.
- Founded in 2022 and backed by Kleiner Perkins and Gradient Ventures, Q.ai’s founding team (Maizels, Yonatan Wexler, Avi Barliya) will join Apple.
- Why it matters: Apple, Meta, and Google are racing to differentiate AI through hardware. High-fidelity, low-latency audio understanding is a frontier for wearables, assistants, translation, accessibility, and AR interfaces—and Apple rarely writes checks this large unless it plans deep integration.
- Timing: The deal lands hours before Apple’s quarterly earnings, where analysts expect ~$138B in revenue and the strongest iPhone growth in four years.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Subvocalization and "Mind Reading" Tech**
A significant portion of the discussion focused on the specific mechanics of Q.ai’s technology. Users speculated that the "whispered speech" capabilities rely on detecting faint neuromuscular signals from the face and throat (subvocalization), drawing comparisons to MIT’s "AlterEgo" project. Commenters explained that because "inner speech" activates voice-related muscles (larynx, tongue, lips) in extremely subtle ways, sensitive equipment could theoretically transcribe thoughts that aren't audible. This prompted sci-fi comparisons, with users citing *Ender’s Game* (specifically the AI "Jane") and Isaac Asimov’s *Foundation* series regarding non-verbal communication.

**Hardware and Consumer Applications**
Users theorized how this tech will manifest in products. The most common predictions included:
*   **AirPods:** Enabling silent commands or improved dictation in public without speaking aloud.
*   **Siri & Smart Home:** Hopes that this will revitalize Siri, which many commenters criticized as stagnating. Some speculated this is part of a play for a competitor to the Echo Show or Nest Hub, where understanding non-verbal cues could differentiate the product.
*   **Accessibility:** Potential uses for disability-focused individualized dictation.

**Strategy and Skepticism**
The corporate implications sparked debate about Apple’s innovation trajectory.
*   **The "Intel" Phase:** Some users worried Apple is entering a phase similar to Intel in the 2010s—attempting to buy innovation through expensive acquisitions while struggling to integrate them, rather than innovating internally.
*   **Valuation:** Several commenters found the nearly $2B valuation difficult to justify based on the vague public details, with cynical takes suggesting the premium might be for potential "military-grade spyware" applications rather than consumer software.
*   **Autocorrect Frustrations:** A side discussion vented frustration about the current state of Apple’s text input, with users complaining that autocorrect has degraded over time and is inferior to legacy technology like BlackBerry keyboards.

**The PrimeSense Connection**
Commenters highlighted the significance of the "reunion" aspect, noting that CEO Aviad Maizels previously sold PrimeSense to Apple, which was the foundational technology for Face ID. Users viewed this as a signal that this acquisition implies a major hardware transition similar to the move from Touch ID to Face ID.

### Benchmarking OpenTelemetry: Can AI trace your failed login?

#### [Submission URL](https://quesma.com/blog/introducing-otel-bench/) | 141 points | by [stared](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stared) | [81 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46811588)

Benchmark: Can AI actually instrument OpenTelemetry? Short answer: not reliably.

What they did
- Built OTelBench, an open-source benchmark of 23 real-world tracing tasks across 11 languages (Go, Java, C++, Python, JS, PHP, Ruby, Rust, Erlang, .NET, Swift).
- Ran 14 frontier models in a Linux-terminal agent setup on ~300-LOC microservices, 3 attempts per task, using Harbor (from the TerminalBench creators). Total: 966 runs, $522 in tokens.
- Requirements matched real SRE work: adhere to OTel semantic conventions, propagate context across services, use standard env vars, recent SDKs, and send data to a backend.

Results
- All models struggled with OpenTelemetry instrumentation.
- Best scores: Claude 4.5 Opus 29% success; GPT‑5.2 26%; Gemini 3 Pro ~ on par with Gemini 3 Flash at 19%.
- Polyglot stacks are brittle: missing instrumentation in one service breaks the entire trace chain.

Common failure mode
- Models often merged independent user actions into a single trace instead of creating distinct traces (unique TraceIDs) per request. Example: “happy path” search + a deliberate invalid-token request ended up in one trace, obscuring the error path.

Why it matters
- LLMs are good at writing functions, but production-grade observability remains hard.
- Even with a standard like OpenTelemetry, complexity is high (echoing the 39% “too complex” signal in the 2025 Observability Survey).
- Auto-instrumentation can be noisy; hand-rolled instrumentation still needs expert review.

Try it yourself
- OTelBench is open source: QuesmaOrg/otel-bench. Charts on the OTelBench site; contributions welcome.

Takeaway: Today’s LLMs can help, but you shouldn’t trust them to wire tracing across a real microservices stack without human SRE oversight.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments:

**Critique of the Benchmark Methodology**
Several users questioned the validity of the benchmark. Commenters like *the_duke* argued that the instructions provided to the models appeared vague (e.g., "use standard OTel patterns"), noting that without specific guidance on libraries or strict requirements, even human developers would struggle to guess the implementation details required to pass specific test suites. Some suspected the test harnesses themselves might have been written by AI, creating a recursive quality issue.

**Defining the Role: SRE vs. Developer**
A debate emerged regarding whether OpenTelemetry instrumentation is actually an SRE task.
*   **SRE Perspective:** Users like *sathish316* argued that SRE work focuses on finding root causes, querying metrics, and ensuring reliability, whereas writing instrumentation code is a software engineering (SWE) task.
*   **Counterpoint:** Others countered that SREs are responsible for "making software reliable," which inherently includes implementing the telemetry required to understand failure modes.

**The "Prompt Engineering" Trade-off**
Commenters noted that model performance improves drastically if users provide "painstakingly detailed" prompts (e.g., specifying specific functional helpers, error typing, and span orchestration).
*   **The Skeptics:** User *ddnhw* played devil’s advocate: if a "simple" task requires PhD-level detailed instructions (comparable to hand-holding a junior intern), the ROI of using the AI diminishes compared to just writing the code.
*   **The Proponents:** Others argued that "prompt engineering" is simply a buzzword for writing good documentation and specifications, which is a necessary engineering skill regardless of AI.

**Why Models Struggle (Code vs. Operations)**
Users discussed *why* the models fail.
*   **Context:** Polyglot microservices require a context window that captures the interplay between services, which is difficult for current models.
*   **Training Data Bias:** User *jmlck* proposed a theory for why AI is better at coding than at the "sysadmin" parts of the benchmark (like checking ports or killing processes): Models are trained on GitHub repositories (code), not bash histories or terminal logs. Consequently, they lack the "muscle memory" for operational CLI tasks that seasoned sysadmins possess.

**Complexity of the Task**
Finally, there was strong pushback against the submission title calling these tasks "simple." Commenters labeled the title as editorialized (the original title was less charged), arguing that properly instrumenting distributed tracing across microservices is a complex domain problem that challenges experienced humans, particularly in messy enterprise environments without standardized stacks.

### Code World Model

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/facebookresearch/cwm) | 14 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46814448)

Meta’s FAIR team released Code World Model (CWM), a 32B-parameter open-weights LLM aimed at code generation and reasoning about program state. The twist: it’s trained on observation–action trajectories from Python execution traces and “agentic” interactions in containerized environments, then post-trained with multi-task RL across verifiable coding, math, and multi-turn software engineering tasks.

Highlights
- Models state changes: focuses on how code and commands affect a running system, not just token prediction.
- Benchmarks and reproducibility: code and scripts to reproduce results on SWE-bench Verified, LiveCodeBench, AIME, and MATH.
- Weights: available via Hugging Face (gated access) for vLLM; PyTorch Distributed Checkpoint (DCP) via signed URLs for deeper integration.
- Inference and demos: reference server (Fastgen) and “neural debugger” demos included.
- Practical notes: needs a specific system prompt for best results; default demos/evals expect hefty hardware (~160 GB GPU VRAM and RDMA).
- Licensing: repository code under BSD-3; model weights under a custom license.

Why it matters
CWM pushes beyond autocomplete-style coding by explicitly learning how actions change environment and program state—useful for agentic coding, debugging, and verifiable workflows.

**Performance & Benchmarks**
Users compared the model’s performance (specifically a 65.8% score on SWE-bench) to competitors like Devstral Small 2. This sparked curiosity about whether the complex "world modeling" approach is necessary, or if simpler techniques could achieve similar environment understanding. There was also brief skepticism regarding the reliability of the benchmark sets themselves.

**Hardware Requirements**
Commenters initially balked at the "160GB VRAM" requirement mentioned for evaluation settings. However, others clarified that because CWM is a 32B parameter model, it is much more accessible in practice: it requires roughly 80GB for full fidelity and can fit into ~20GB VRAM using Q4 quantization. Tools like llama.cpp and Ollama were suggested for running the model on consumer hardware.

### Putting Gemini to Work in Chrome

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/chrome/gemini-3-auto-browse/) | 50 points | by [diwank](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=diwank) | [62 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46805557)

Google is baking Gemini directly into Chrome on macOS, Windows, and Chromebook Plus, shifting the browser toward “agentic” assistance that can summarize, plan, and take actions across the web. Built on Gemini 3, the update adds a persistent side panel assistant, deeper integrations with Google apps, and a new “auto browse” agent that can handle multi‑step tasks.

What’s new
- Side panel assistant: Keep your page open while Gemini compares options, summarizes reviews, or wrangles schedules—always available per tab in a docked pane.
- On‑page image transforms: “Nano Banana” lets you modify images in the current page via prompts (e.g., mood boards, infographics) without downloading or re‑uploading.
- Connected Apps: Optional integrations with Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Shopping, and Flights let Gemini pull context (e.g., event emails, flight data) and draft follow‑ups.
- Personal Intelligence (coming months): Opt‑in memory and custom instructions so Chrome can give more contextual, proactive help across sessions; connect/disconnect apps anytime.
- Auto browse (US, paid): For AI Pro and Ultra subscribers, an agent can research, fill forms, schedule, gather documents, compare prices, apply discount codes, and even use Google Password Manager with permission. Multimodal understanding lets it act from images (e.g., source items from a party photo) and stay within budgets.

Why it matters
- Moves Chrome from passive browsing to task completion, with tighter ties to Google’s ecosystem.
- Raises the ceiling on what assistants can do in‑browser (cross‑site workflows), while leaning on opt‑in controls and permissions for connected data.

Availability
- Side panel and image transforms: rolling out to all Gemini in Chrome users.
- Auto browse: US only, AI Pro/Ultra subscribers.
- Personal Intelligence: “in the coming months.”

Here is a summary of the story and the discussion on Hacker News.

### Google bakes Gemini directly into Chrome
Google is shifting Chrome from a passive browser to an "agentic" assistant by integrating Gemini directly into the desktop client for macOS, Windows, and Chromebook Plus. The update introduces a persistent side panel for summarizing and comparing content, along with "Nano Banana," a tool for transforming on-page images without leaving the tab. Deep integration with Google’s ecosystem (Gmail, Maps, Calendar) allows the browser to draft follow-ups based on personal context. Additionally, a paid "auto browse" feature (currently US-only) will act as an agent to handle multi-step workflows like researching, form-filling, and purchasing.

### In the Comments
The discussion on Hacker News was skeptical but highlighted specific niches where browser agents could be transformative.

**The "Admin" Use Case**
While many users struggled to see the appeal for general browsing, a strong contingent argued this is ideal for "tedium management."
*   **Developer toil:** Several commenters mentioned using AI agents to navigate complex, sluggish interfaces like App Store Connect, AWS S3 bucket configuration, or analyzing SOC2 tickets.
*   **Bad UX:** One user noted that while standard booking sites are fine, agents shine when dealing with notoriously difficult interfaces, such as booking flights on specific foreign airlines with buggy UIs.
*   **Bureaucracy:** One commenter suggested agents are perfect for "bypassing stupid company processes to achieve actual productivity," essentially automating corporate theater.

**Skepticism and "Nano Banana"**
There was significant ridicule regarding the feature name "Nano Banana" (for image transforms) and the marketing language surrounding "creative power."
*   **The Abstraction Debate:** A debate emerged about whether users *want* to delegate browsing. While some viewed it as a helpful abstraction (like hiring a plumber vs. DIY), others argued that for things like shopping or finding a restaurant, the search process involves nuance and personal preference that an AI might strip away.
*   **Ad Revenue Paradox:** Users questioned the economics: if an agent skips ads to complete a task, it hurts Google's core business model. Others suspected the agent might specifically avoid skipping *Google* ads.

**Privacy and Security**
Trust remains a major hurdle. Commenters expressed hesitation about "auto browse" features that require giving an AI permission to use the Google Password Manager or access personal data to fill forms.
*   **Ad Blockers:** The conversation inevitably touched on Manifest V3, with users arguing that the most useful "agent" for a browser remains a functional ad blocker, which they feel Google has undermined.
*   **Market Position:** Comparisons were made to OpenAI's "Operator" (Atlas) and Microsoft's Copilot, with users noting that while the tech is impressive, the "Clippy-fication" of the browser feels intrusive to power users.

### AI on Australian travel company website sent tourists to nonexistent hot springs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/28/travel/ai-tourism-nonexistent-hotsprings-intl-scli) | 111 points | by [breve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=breve) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46808103)

AI-generated travel guide sends tourists to nonexistent Tasmanian “hot springs”

- A tour company’s blog post, generated by outsourced AI and published without final review, recommended “Weldborough Hot Springs” in northeast Tasmania—an attraction that doesn’t exist. Tourists subsequently began calling and arriving “in droves” at the local Weldborough Hotel looking for it.
- The operator, Australian Tours and Cruises (Tasmania Tours), apologized, blaming an unreviewed AI post: “our AI has messed up completely.” The small business says the backlash has been “soul-destroying” and that it was trying to keep content “fresh” to compete.
- Local owner Kristy Probert fielded multiple daily inquiries; she joked, “If you can find these hot springs, beers are on me.” The nearby Weld River is “freezing,” and the only heat source mentioned was a sauna in another town.
- Context: An Australian tourism academic says AI is now ubiquitous in travel planning—about 37% of tourists use it—and warns that “around 90%” of AI-generated itineraries contain mistakes, which can be dangerous in remote areas with no services or cell coverage.
- Advice from experts: Use AI as a starting point only; cross-check with guidebooks, trusted review sites, travel agents, and local hosts/concierges.

Why it matters: Another real-world case of LLM hallucinations leaping off the page. For small operators racing to publish SEO content, human-in-the-loop review and basic ground-truth checks are essential—or the reputational damage can be very real.

Here is a summary of the discussion on Hacker News:

**“Agency Laundering” and Accountability**
The primary focus of the discussion is the concept of "agency laundering"—a term users applied to the company’s attempt to blame the AI for the mistake. Commenters argued that stating "our AI messed up" is a zero-effort way to externalize the risks of automation while keeping the profits.
*   **The "Unaccountability Machine":** Users drew parallels to corporate bureaucracies where responsibility is diffused so effectively that no single human is ever at fault.
*   **Comparisons:** Several commenters equated this to social media platforms claiming to be neutral hosts to avoid liability for content, or future scenarios where "lethal autonomous robots" might commit errors with no clear human to blame.
*   **Air Canada Precedent:** One user noted that this "the AI did it" defense is legally shaky, citing a recent case where Air Canada was held liable for its chatbot’s hallucinations.

**Skepticism of the "Small Business" Narrative**
While the business owner expressed that the backlash was "soul-destroying," many commenters were unsympathetic. They characterized the incident as a predictable result of "playing the SEO game" with cheap, unverified content (often referred to as "slop").
*   **Intentional Negligence:** Critics felt that utilizing outsourced AI to mass-produce blog posts without reading them constitutes a "willful disregard for the truth."
*   **FAFO:** The sentiment was summarized by one user as a case of "publish loose, find out the loose consequences."

**The Debate: Fraud vs. Negligence**
A significant portion of the thread debated the legal implications of publishing entirely invented travel destinations.
*   **Defining Fraud:** Some argued this constitutes fraud or "constructive fraud," as the company presented falsehoods as facts to attract customers. Others countered that legal fraud requires *intent* to deceive; since the company was likely just lazy/negligent rather than malicious, it might not meet the legal threshold for fraud in Australia.
*   **Public Awareness:** A counter-argument was suggested that because it is common knowledge that "AI makes stuff up," failing to verify the output before publishing is a form of willful misrepresentation.

**Technical Reality Check**
Finally, technical commenters pushed back on the phrasing that the AI "messed up." They noted that Generative AI worked exactly as designed—automating the creation of plausible-sounding text concepts—and that the failure lies entirely with the human expectation that an LLM creates factual truth.

### UK Government to Create 'British FBI', Roll Out Nationwide Facial Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theepochtimes.com/world/uk-government-to-create-british-fbi-roll-out-nationwide-facial-recognition-cameras-5976929) | 42 points | by [hentrep](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hentrep) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46807431)

- UK Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood outlined plans for a new National Police Service (NPS) — billed as a “British FBI” — to take over counter‑terrorism and organized crime, freeing local forces to focus on shoplifting and street robbery. Announced in Parliament on Jan 26.

- The plan includes a nationwide rollout of facial recognition cameras, a move likely to spark privacy and civil liberties scrutiny over accuracy, bias, data retention, and oversight.

- Opposition response: Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp criticized the proposal, arguing it would create a force that’s too large and centralized.

- Key unknowns: how the NPS will interact with existing agencies (e.g., current national and counter‑terrorism units), governance and accountability structures, and the legal framework for facial recognition deployment.

- Why it matters for HN: centralizing policing plus mass facial recognition could reshape UK surveillance capabilities and set precedents for tech procurement, model accuracy standards, auditing, and public transparency.

**Daily Digest: UK's "British FBI" and Facial Recognition Plans**

The discussion regarding the UK Home Secretary's proposal for a new National Police Service and nationwide facial recognition centered on political skepticism, the specifics of UK law enforcement structures, and fears of creeping authoritarianism.

*   **Slide towards Authoritarianism:** Many users viewed the announcement as further evidence of the UK "sprinting towards authoritarianism." However, a counter-argument was raised that the "average British voter" actually desires these measures. Commenters noted a sharp generational divide in polling, suggesting that while giving the state arbitrary power is unpopular with under-40s, it polls well with those over 40.
*   **Redundancy and the NCA:** several users expressed confusion over how this new "British FBI" differs from the existing National Crime Agency (NCA). Participants deduced that the plan likely involves merging the NCA with regional outcome bodies, though some questioned the efficiency of rebranding existing frameworks.
*   **Surveillance Cynicism:** There was distinct cynicism regarding the facial recognition aspect. Some users compared the rollout to Chinese surveillance state tactics, while others argued that given the ubiquity of CCTV in the UK, the government likely already uses nationwide facial recognition "on the down-low."
*   **Political Tangents (Reform vs. Tories):** A significant portion of the thread digressed into an analysis of the UK's right-wing political landscape. Users debated the viability of the Reform party, with one user characterizing it as the "Temu Tory Party" (a cheap knock-off of the Conservatives). This sparked a broader debate about political realignment in user democracies, drawing comparisons to US political history (Whigs, FDR, Reagan).
*   **Source Skepticism:** One user repeatedly dismissed the premise of the story—specifically the civil liberties framing—as resembling "Epoch Times" or supermarket tabloid reporting, though others engaged with the substance of the policy critique.

### Slopaganda: AI images posted by the White House and what they teach us

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/29/the-slopaganda-era-10-ai-images-posted-by-the-white-house-and-what-they-teach-us) | 99 points | by [lemming](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lemming) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46816212)

Top story: The White House’s “slopaganda” — AI memes as official comms

What happened
- The Guardian surveys how the Trump White House has turned AI-generated memes into a communications strategy, dubbed “slopaganda” — low-effort, high-engagement synthetic media used to provoke and dominate attention.
- Know Your Meme’s Don Caldwell calls it “institutional shitposting,” noting how quickly the account rides fresh meme formats.

Notable examples from the piece
- Trump as king on a fake Time cover (Feb 2025), posted alongside a policy fight over NYC congestion pricing.
- Studio Ghibli–style image of a crying woman being deported by ICE (Mar 2025), exploiting a viral OpenAI “Ghibli” filter trend and raising consent/style-appropriation concerns.
- Trump as Pope (May 2025), posted during mourning for Pope Francis, sparking backlash from Catholic groups and framed by the president as “just a joke.”
- Trump as a Jedi on Star Wars Day (May 2025), pure fantasy hero art to commandeer a cultural moment.
- Opposition leaders depicted in stereotyped Mexican attire (Oct 2025), using provocation to capture attention.

Why it matters for HN
- Normalizes state use of synthetic media: Deepfakes and AI art move from fringe boards to official channels, blurring satire, propaganda, and policy messaging.
- Engagement over accuracy: Outrage-bait drives reach; “it’s a joke” provides post hoc deniability.
- Tech and IP friction: Style-cloning (e.g., Studio Ghibli) without permission; questions around labeling, provenance, and platform policy.
- Info hygiene risk: Increases noise, fact-checking load, and the incentive for other political actors to adopt similar tactics.

Big questions
- Should platforms require provenance labels or cryptographic signing for government media?
- How should media cover troll-bait without amplifying it?
- Where do defamation, privacy, and cultural/ religious offense intersect with “satire” defenses for official accounts?

**The Impact on Civic Norms and Meaning**
Much of the conversation centered on the societal costs of "institutional shitposting." Users debated the "trickle-down" effect of leadership ethics, with one commenter drawing an analogy to a "drunk bishop" lowering standards for their congregation. This prompted a citation of Justice Louis Brandeis (1928), arguing that when the government becomes a lawbreaker or ignores standards of conduct, it "breeds contempt for law" and invites anarchy. Others referenced Henry Farrell and Philip K. Dick to argue that this strategy isn't just about memes, but a nihilistic attempt to destroy shared meaning and truth through "smirking deceitful nonsense."

**Psychology and Strategy**
The strategic effectiveness of the memes was contested. While some users dismissed the behavior through the lens of mental health or child development, others warned that expressing outrage ("getting triggered") is exactly the reaction the strategy aims to provoke. There was a counter-argument that realizing standards have been lowered does not equate to being unwillingly manipulated.

**Historical and Meta Context**
Smaller threads touched on the aesthetics of the administration compare to a "second Gilded Age." Additionally, users noted the submission itself was heavily flagged and downvoted on Hacker News, sparking brief meta-commentary on how the community handles politically polarizing tech stories.

### Microsoft stock plummets as investors fret on AI spend

#### [Submission URL](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/microsoft-q2-earnings-beat-but-stock-plummets-as-investors-fret-on-ai-spend-cloud-growth-154618162.html) | 67 points | by [m-hodges](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=m-hodges) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46812206)

Microsoft beats, stock tanks: AI capex jitters and cloud growth angst

- Headline numbers: EPS $5.16 on revenue $81.27B vs. $3.92 and $80.3B expected. Microsoft Cloud topped $50B for the first time at $51.5B (vs. $51.2B est.).
- Segments: Intelligent Cloud (incl. Azure) $32.9B (vs. $32.2B est.); Productivity & Business Processes $34.1B (vs. $33.6B); More Personal Computing $14.3B (in line).
- Market reaction: Shares fell ~11% Thursday despite the beat, on fears of slowing cloud growth and surging AI-related spending.
- AI strain and spend: Management says AI demand is outpacing capacity, capping revenue near term. Capex jumped to $37.5B in the quarter, up from $22.6B a year ago.
- Demand proxy: Remaining performance obligations reached $625B; Yahoo Finance reports ~45% tied to OpenAI-related commitments—a metric investors are watching to gauge AI demand.
- Context: Nadella says Microsoft’s AI business is already larger than some of its biggest franchises, but investors worry about the bill to build it.
- Peers and stock tape: Over the past year, MSFT has lagged Amazon; both trail Google, up 69% on the back of Gemini 3 momentum.
- Analyst color: “Maybe it wasn’t high enough,” says RBC’s Rishi Jaluria on Intelligent Cloud vs. investor hopes.

Why it matters: Microsoft just crossed a symbolic $50B cloud milestone, but the next leg depends on how fast it can add AI capacity without spooking investors on returns. What to watch: Azure growth trajectory next quarter, capex guidance, and updates on AI capacity relief.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Microsoft Beats Earnings but Stock Dips on AI Costs**
Despite Microsoft beating revenue and EPS expectations—with its cloud business topping $50B for the first time—shares fell ~11% on concerns over creating enough AI capacity and the massive capital expenditures required to build it.

**Discussion Highlights**
*   **Capacity Paradox:** Commenters pointed out a contradiction in Microsoft's narrative: management claims demand is outstripping supply (capacity constraints), yet everyday users feel Microsoft is agglomerating AI features into products where they aren't wanted.
*   **Who is the "Customer"?** Several users argued that the "demand" isn't coming from end-users, but rather from C-suite executives and managers buying into the promise of replacing workers with AI agents to cut costs.
*   **Circular Revenue Skepticism:** There was discussion regarding the quality of the revenue, with some calling it "circular financing magic"—Microsoft invests in OpenAI, and OpenAI immediately pays that money back to Microsoft for infrastructure.
*   **Copilot Adoption:** In response to demand questions, one user cited recent reports that Microsoft 365 Copilot has hit 1.5 million annual users, theoretically representing ~$540M in annualized revenue.
*   **Market Expectations:** The thread touched on the harsh reality of current market expectations, where posting billions in profit and growth is still punished by investors if it doesn't meet specific hype-driven metrics or if capex is viewed as too high.

### Bug in AI Toy Console leaked 50k kid's conversation

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/an-ai-toy-exposed-50000-logs-of-its-chats-with-kids-to-anyone-with-a-gmail-account/) | 22 points | by [rez0__](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rez0__) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46813944)

AI plush toy exposes kids’ private chats via unsecured portal

- Security researchers Joseph Thacker and Joel Margolis found that Bondu, an AI-enabled stuffed dinosaur, left a parent/staff web console wide open: anyone with a Google account could log in and view virtually all children's conversations with the toy—no hacking required.
- Exposed data reportedly included kids’ names, birth dates, family member names, parent-set “objectives,” and detailed chat transcripts; Bondu confirmed more than 50,000 transcripts were accessible. Audio wasn’t stored, but written transcripts were.
- After being alerted, Bondu took the portal down within minutes and relaunched it with proper authentication the next day. The CEO said fixes were completed within hours, a broader security review followed, users were notified, and a security firm was hired. The company says it found no evidence of access beyond the researchers.
- Researchers warn this highlights broader risks with AI chat toys: persistent, intimate data about children; unclear internal access controls; and the risk a single compromised employee account could re-expose everything. One called the leak “a kidnapper’s dream.”
- They also noted Bondu’s backend appears to use Google’s Gemini and OpenAI models; the company says it uses enterprise AI providers with minimized data sharing and configurations that prevent training on prompts/outputs.
- The researchers suspect the exposed console may have been “vibe-coded” with generative AI tools, echoing worries that AI-assisted development can introduce basic security flaws.

Why it matters: Even brief lapses in access control can turn AI toys into troves of highly sensitive children’s data. The incident underscores the need for default-secure design, strict internal access audits, and real scrutiny of third-party AI data handling.

**Discussion Summary:**

Commenters focused on the privacy implications and psychological effects of AI-enabled toys:

*   **Surveillance Risks:** Users expressed concern about internet-connected, corporate-controlled microphones entering the home. There is fear that these devices could inadvertently record background conversations—such as private political discussions—creating potential risks for abuse by governments or corporations.
*   **Cognitive Impact:** Discussion highlighted the issue of children interacting with "stochastic predictors." Commenters noted that kids likely lack the mental capacity to understand they are communicating with a machine rather than a sentient being, drawing comparisons to a high-tech Tamagotchi.
*   **The Vulnerability:** Users flagged the specific mechanics of the breach, emphasizing the article’s note that the logs were exposed simply via a standard Gmail account login.

### Trinity large: An open 400B sparse MoE model

#### [Submission URL](https://www.arcee.ai/blog/trinity-large) | 226 points | by [linolevan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=linolevan) | [73 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46789561)

Trinity 
\\(400B) drops as a highly sparse MoE—and you can try the Preview free on OpenRouter for a limited time.

What’s new
- Model family: Three checkpoints
  - Trinity-Large-Preview: lightly post-trained, chat-ready “instruct” model (not a reasoning model yet)
  - Trinity-Large-Base: best 17T-token pretraining checkpoint (frontier-class foundation model)
  - Trinity-Large-TrueBase: early 10T-token checkpoint with no instruct data or LR anneals (a “true base”)
- Architecture: 400B-parameter sparse MoE, 256 experts with 4 active per token (≈1.56% routed; ~13B active params/token). They doubled dense layers (3→6) to keep routing stable at this sparsity—more aggressive than most peers, rivaled mainly by Llama 4 Maverick.
- Training scale: 2048 Nvidia B300 GPUs; they claim it’s the largest publicly stated pretraining run on B300s. Finished pretraining in 33 days.

Why it matters
- Speed: Thanks to high sparsity and efficient attention, they report 2–3x faster inference/training for the same hardware versus peers in the same “weight class.”
- Performance: Trinity-Large-Base scores at frontier level across math, coding, scientific reasoning, and knowledge benchmarks, per the team.
- Data engine: 17T tokens across three phases (10T + 4T + 3T), curated by DatologyAI, including 8T+ synthetic tokens spanning web, code, math, reasoning, and multilingual (targeting 14 non‑English languages).

How they made a 400B MoE behave
- Momentum-based expert load balancing: adjusts per-expert router bias up/down with tanh clipping, momentum smoothing, plus a per-sequence balance loss to avoid within-sequence hot spots.
- z-loss: regularizes LM head to prevent logit scale creep; they monitor logit stats for early instability signals.
- Parallelism and optimizer: HSDP with expert parallelism 8 (yielding 2048 DP ranks); scaled batch size after 5T tokens. Used Muon (supports larger critical batch than AdamW), guided by MiniMax-01 batch-scaling results. Smooth loss curve with clear phase transitions.

Caveats
- The Preview is intentionally a non-reasoning instruct model; a full reasoning variant is in post-training and will take longer due to extra tokens per output, but sparsity helps speed RL rollouts.

Try it
- Trinity-Large-Preview is available free on OpenRouter for a limited time.

**The Wall, The Cost, and The Benchmarks**
The release of Trinity Large (400B) sparked a broad debate on the current state of frontier AI models, with conversation shifting from the specific model to the trajectory of the industry at large.

*   **Is AI hitting a "brick wall"?** A significant portion of the discussion focused on whether LLM progress has plateaued. Some users argued that recent gains are marginal—comparing the ELO gap between Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o as feeling like a "coin flip" (50% chance of being better) rather than a leap. Others pushed back, noting that ELO statistics imply a significant win rate (70%) despite looking close on charts, and argued that progress has shifted from linear chat improvements to step-change capabilities in coding and complex math (citing Terence Tao’s recent use of o1).
*   **Skepticism of benchmarks:** Trust in public leaderboards like LMSYS Arena is eroding among some HN users, who described them as "Markdown usage detectors" or measures of style rather than reasoning. Participants suggested that real progress is now found in private evaluations or harder, specific benchmarks (like LiveBench or METR) rather than general chat arenas.
*   **The economics of "33 days":** Commenters scrutinized the claim that the model finished pretraining in 33 days on 2048 Nvidia B300s. While some calculated the raw compute cost at roughly $10 million, critics noted this figure is misleading. They argued that quoting a "final run" cost ignores the tens of millions spent on failed experiments, dataset curation, and infrastructure setup, similar to misunderstandings around DeepSeek’s reported costs.
*   **Early feedback:** Initial user impressions were mixed to skeptical. One user reported the model failed to understand technical concepts (specifically GitHub Action DAGs), while others doubted the validity of comparing a 400B sparse MoE to "Llama 4" architecture without independent verification. Use cases for running such large models at home are also becoming increasingly infeasible due to hardware costs.

### LM Studio 0.4

#### [Submission URL](https://lmstudio.ai/blog/0.4.0) | 209 points | by [jiqiren](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jiqiren) | [114 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799477)

LM Studio 0.4.0: headless server, parallel inference, and a stateful chat API

What’s new
- Headless core (“llmster”): The LM Studio engine now runs as a standalone daemon without the GUI, suitable for servers, CI, Colab, or terminal-only workflows. Quick start: install (curl/irm), lms daemon up, lms get <model>, lms server start, lms chat.
- Parallel requests with continuous batching: llama.cpp 2.0.0 brings concurrent inference to the same model. New loader options:
  - Max Concurrent Predictions: cap simultaneous requests; extras queue.
  - Unified KV Cache (default): shared, non-partitioned cache for variable-length requests.
  - Note: MLX engine doesn’t support this yet; it’s coming.
- Stateful REST API: POST /v1/chat maintains conversation state via response_id/previous_response_id, keeps payloads small, and returns detailed perf stats (tokens in/out, speed, time-to-first-token). It can also use locally configured MCP tools (permission-gated).
- Permission keys: Gate which clients can access your LM Studio server (Settings > Server).
- UI refresh: Split View (side-by-side chats), chat export (PDF/Markdown/text), Developer Mode (advanced options), and in‑app docs.
- New CLI flow: lms chat for interactive terminal sessions; plus lms runtime update and other streamlined commands.

Why it matters
- Deploy anywhere: Decoupling the core from the app makes local-first models practical on cloud/GPU rigs and in automation.
- Higher throughput: Continuous batching + concurrency turns LM Studio into a more capable API server for multi-user or web workloads.
- Easier app integration: A stateful /v1/chat simplifies multi-step workflows and tool use without shipping full transcripts.

Notable fixes
- MCPs now lazy-load on demand.
- Various UI/installer bugs squashed (icons, model picker, downloads, lms import).

**LM Studio vs. Ollama:** The most active area of discussion compared the two tools. Users debated their underlying architectures:
*   **Model Storage:** several commenters criticized Ollama’s decision to mimic Docker by using a registry and "blob" storage system. While this makes pulling models easy for non-technical users, it frustrates developers because it duplicates files and makes it difficult to share model weights across different applications. In contrast, users praised LM Studio for using standard directories and GGUF files that can be easily accessed by other tools.
*   **Convergence:** Commenters noted that the tools are functionally converging from opposite directions. Ollama started as a CLI/API tool and is adding UI elements, while LM Studio started as a GUI tool and is now adding headless/CLI capabilities.

**Headless Mode & CLI:** The introduction of the headless "llmster" core was well-received by those wanting to run LM Studio on servers or CI environments without the desktop overhead.
*   There was initial confusion regarding whether the desktop app needed to remain open for the CLI to function; users clarified that the new daemon allows for a truly headless experience.
*   Mac users specifically highlighted MLX support as a primary reason for sticking with LM Studio over other runners.

**Performance & UI:**
*   **Throughput:** There was a debate regarding the new parallel request feature. While some worried that splitting resources would halve performance per user, others clarified that continuous batching allows for significantly higher total token throughput (citing up to 1300 t/s on M-series chips) by utilizing idle compute time.
*   **Visuals:** The UI refresh proved polarizing; some users complained that the new "dark mode" is actually grey and criticized the aesthetic for looking like a "toy" or "WhatsApp" rather than a professional developer tool.
*   **Licensing:** A few users expressed a wish that LM Studio itself were open source, noting that while the underlying engines (llama.cpp) are open, the wrapper remains proprietary.

### Show HN: A MitM proxy to see what your LLM tools are sending

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jmuncor/sherlock) | 205 points | by [jmuncor](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jmuncor) | [110 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799898)

Sherlock: Real-time LLM token tracker and prompt inspector for CLI tools

What it is
- A local HTTP proxy + terminal dashboard that intercepts LLM API calls to show live token usage, context-window “fuel gauge,” and recent requests.
- Automatically archives every prompt/response as markdown and JSON for debugging and review.
- Targets CLI workflows with zero config: wrap your tool and watch stats update in real time.

How it works
- Start the proxy/dashboard: sherlock start (defaults to localhost:8080; set token limit with -l).
- Run your tool through Sherlock: sherlock claude, sherlock codex, or sherlock run --provider <name> <cmd>.
- Dashboard highlights context usage (green/yellow/red) and prints a session summary on exit.

Why it matters
- Quickly spot runaway token usage and context overflow.
- Track costs via token counts during development.
- Create an audit trail of prompts to refine and debug your prompting.

Supported/limits
- Providers: Anthropic (Claude Code) and OpenAI Codex supported.
- Gemini CLI blocked by an upstream base-URL issue when using OAuth.
- Python 3.10+; local interception only (be mindful of sensitive data in saved logs).

Repo
- MIT license. ~455 stars, 16 forks.
- GitHub: https://github.com/jmuncor/sherlock

Based on the discussion, the community response focused primarily on a critical security flaw and the broader implications of AI-generated code ("vibe coding"). Here is the summary:

**Critical Security Vulnerability**
*   **TLS Disabled:** Users immediately identified that the tool unconditionally disabled TLS verification (`ssl_insecure=true` passed to mitmproxy). Code reviewers noted this exposes users to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks if used on public networks (e.g., coffee shops).
*   **The Fix:** The author (OP) acknowledged the mistake and pushed a fix during the discussion to implement a simple HTTP relay that eliminates the insecure mitmproxy implementation.

**"Vibe Coding" and AI Generation**
*   **AI Authorship:** Commenters noted the code contained artifacts indicating it was generated by AI (e.g., git commits "Co-Authored-By Claude Opus").
*   **Critique of "Vibe Coding":** The security flaw was cited as a prime example of the dangers of "vibe coding"—generating software via LLMs without possessing the technical knowledge to audit or understand the output. Critics argued that disabling SSL is a "huge red flag" that a human developer would likely catch, but an AI might insert to solve a debugging error.
*   **Open Source "Pollution":** Senior engineers expressed frustration that AI allows inexperienced developers to create projects with professional-looking READMEs, garnering hundreds of stars despite having "student-level" or dangerous code internals. This makes it difficult to distinguish production-ready software from prototypes.

**Market Need**
*   **Enterprise Governance:** Despite the code quality issues, some commenters validated the problem statements, noting a lack of standard enterprise tools for governing AI data usage, auditing prompts, and managing token budgets in large organizations.
*   **Implementation:** Some suggested this functionality would be better implemented as a standard plugin/addon for existing tools like `mitmproxy` rather than a standalone wrapper.

### UK Government’s ‘AI Skills Hub’ was delivered by PwC for £4.1M

#### [Submission URL](https://mahadk.com/posts/ai-skills-hub) | 379 points | by [JustSkyfall](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=JustSkyfall) | [141 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46803119)

UK’s £4.1m “AI Skills Hub” is mostly a link list, with busted UX and errors, says critic

- The UK government launched an AI Skills Hub to train 10 million workers by 2030. According to a detailed blog post, the site—built by PwC for £4.1m (~$5.6m)—mostly aggregates links to existing external courses (e.g., Salesforce Trailhead) rather than hosting original content.
- The author calls the UI “vibecoded” and highlights basic usability issues: a tiny “Enroll Now” button, a comment section where users expect next steps, and a prominently linked “Skills & Training Gap Analysis” that appears closed to the public.
- PwC reportedly acknowledges the site doesn’t fully meet accessibility standards, which public-sector sites are legally required to follow. The post also flags a substantive content error: teaching “fair use” (a US concept) instead of the UK’s more restrictive “fair dealing.”
- Beyond the build quality, the author is angry about value for money, arguing small UK dev shops could deliver better for a fraction of the cost, and that the public likely won’t use the site in its current state.

Why it matters: Another government IT procurement raising questions about cost, accessibility compliance, and delivery quality. Open questions include what the £4.1m covered (e.g., discovery, hosting, support, marketing, licensing) and whether further phases are planned to fix core issues.

**Discussion Summary:**

The commentary focuses heavily on the structural incentives of government procurement that lead to outcomes like this. Users argue that the "nobody gets fired for buying IBM" adage explains the selection of PwC: civil servants prioritize risk mitigation over product quality, knowing that hiring a "respectable" large firm shields them from personal blame if the project fails, whereas hiring a small, agile shop constitutes a career risk.

Key points of debate include:
*   **Barriers to Entry:** A significant portion of the thread discusses certifications (specifically ISO 9000) as a form of "grift" or structural gatekeeping. Users note these requirements filter out capable small studios that cannot afford the bureaucratic overhead, favoring large consultancies that specialize in compliance rather than software development.
*   **Process vs. Outcome:** Commenters suggest the high cost isn't just for the code, but for the immense friction of the procurement process itself (endless paperwork, insurance requirements, and audits). The consensus is that the system rewards following legal procedure perfectly rather than delivering a working product.
*   **The "Horizon" Counterpoint:** Some users pushed back on the idea that big firms are "safe," citing the Fujitsu/Post Office scandal, though others retorted that despite such scandals, the procurement habits of the civil service remain unchanged due to entrenched risk aversion.

### Will AIs take all our jobs and end human history, or not? (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/03/will-ais-take-all-our-jobs-and-end-human-history-or-not-well-its-complicated/) | 90 points | by [lukakopajtic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lukakopajtic) | [161 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46797865)

Stephen Wolfram: Will AIs Take All Our Jobs? It’s Complicated

- Shock factor: ChatGPT shattered the sense that essay writing is uniquely human. It stitches together human-like text by following patterns learned from billions of webpages and millions of books.
- What’s really going on: Under the hood is a brain-like neural net doing “raw computation.” Meaning doesn’t emerge from the machine alone; it comes from the human-created data it trains on—and from the human who supplies the goal via a prompt.
- The new interface: Wolfram frames ChatGPT as a “linguistic user interface” (LUI). You provide intent in plain language; the system expands it into coherent prose grounded in shared human context.
- The big shift: “Essayification” just became cheap—like desktop publishing did for typesetting. A polished essay is no longer evidence of effort. The scarce work moves from writing to specifying intent, constraints, and judgment.
- Why prediction is hard: Expect surprises. Wolfram leans on “computational irreducibility” to argue that the trajectory of AI capabilities and social effects can’t be neatly forecast.
- What’s next (teed up for later sections): If AIs can pursue defined goals, the hard part is deciding which goals matter, how to evaluate progress, and how governance should adapt.

Takeaway: Writing as a skill is being unbundled from effort; the human edge shifts to framing problems, setting goals, and providing oversight.

**The American Fear vs. Global Safety Nets**
A significant portion of the discussion centered on whether the existential dread regarding AI displacement is a uniquely American phenomenon. User `mips_avatar` argued that Americans are more stressed because basic survival (healthcare, housing stability) and self-worth are strictly intermediated by corporate employment. By contrast, they suggested that in places with stronger social safety nets (citing Vienna and Vietnam), AI is viewed less as a threat to survival and more as a tool.

**The "Cushy Job" Theory**
Some users pushed back on the safety-net theory, suggesting the anxiety stems from the nature of the US workforce. User `nlyrlczz` posited that the US has a high density of "cushy paper-pushing" and high-paid white-collar roles that are specifically vulnerable to the "essayification" capabilities of LLMs. Others noted that anxiety is not geographically exclusive, with user `trnd` mentioning similar concerns in India.

**The Breakdown of the Labor-Capital Bargain**
Discussion moved to the macroeconomic implications (user `myrmdn`, `BirAdam`). Commenters worried that AI undermines the primary mechanism for wealth redistribution: labor. If AI makes human labor nearly valueless, the current capitalist model of "work for income" fails. The thread debated potential outcomes, ranging from a necessary shift toward socialism or UBI to a dystopian increase in inequality where class barriers become insurmountable.

**Inequality and Deflation**
User `BirAdam` offered a specific economic sequence: AI reduces production costs, which should theoretically lower prices (deflation). However, the "scary part" is the transition period where unemployment spikes before the cost of living drops to match the new reality. There was also debate regarding how deeply AI has actually permeated non-tech sectors, with users clashing over whether rural populations (like farmers) are oblivious to AI or actively using it for high-tech capital management.

### Jellyfin LLM/"AI" Development Policy

#### [Submission URL](https://jellyfin.org/docs/general/contributing/llm-policies/) | 196 points | by [mmoogle](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mmoogle) | [102 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46801976)

The open‑source media server Jellyfin published a clear policy on AI use across its repos and community spaces, aiming to protect code quality while allowing limited, accountable assistance.

What’s new
- No AI-written communication: Issues, feature requests, PR descriptions, and forum/chat posts must be in the contributor’s own words. Exception: clearly labeled LLM-assisted translations, ideally with the original language included.
- Strict rules for code contributions: 
  - Keep PRs focused; no unrelated drive-by changes. Large changes must be split into small, reviewable commits.
  - Meet formatting and quality standards; don’t commit LLM meta/config files.
  - Explain changes yourself in the PR body; if you can’t articulate what and why, it won’t be accepted.
  - Code must build, run, and be explicitly tested.
  - Be prepared to address reviewer feedback without outsourcing fixes to an LLM.
  - “Vibe coding” (letting an LLM loose on the codebase) will be rejected.
- Reviewer discretion: Oversized, over-complex, or squashed PRs that can’t be reasonably reviewed will be rejected, LLM-assisted or not.
- Community sharing: Non-official tools primarily built with LLMs must be clearly labeled as such; users can decide if that’s acceptable. (The policy also hints at guidance for secondary AI assistance like docs/formatting.)

Why it matters
- Signals a maturing norm: maintainers embracing AI as a tool, but demanding authorship, accountability, and testable, reviewable changes.
- Sets expectations for contributors: AI can help, but you own the code and the explanation.
- Likely to spark debate across OSS: balancing velocity vs. maintainability as AI-generated contributions surge.

Based on the discussion, the community reaction focuses heavily on the nuances of communication, the "asymmetry of effort," and the role of language barriers in open source.

**Language Barriers vs. Authenticity**
A significant portion of the debate centers on non-native English speakers. While some argue that LLMs are vital accessibility tools that make open source global, many established contributors argue that "broken English" is preferable to AI-generated prose.
*   Critics note that humans are excellent at deciphering intent from imperfect grammar, whereas LLMs often bury meaning under "hyper-excited corporate drone style" fluff or introduce subtle hallucinations.
*   Several users suggested that providing the original native-language text alongside a standard machine translation (like Google Translate) is more respectful and effective than trying to pass off ChatGPT output as fluent English.

**The Asymmetry of Effort**
Commenters expressed strong feelings that using LLMs for communication is often "disrespectful."
*   The core argument is an imbalance of mental energy: the sender expends zero effort to generate a wall of text, while the recipient must spend high "mental capital" to decode it.
*   One user described this as sending 10 paragraphs of output for a 1-sentence prompt, forcing maintainers to sift through "slop."
*   However, a counter-argument appeared suggesting LLMs can be used virtuously to *shorten* and distill rambling thoughts, provided the user reviews the output.

**Writing is Thinking**
Referencing author Ted Chiang, users argued that writing isn't just a way to convey information—it is the process of thinking itself.
*   By outsourcing the description of a Pull Request (PR) or a feature to an LLM, the contributor may be bypassing the critical cognitive work required to fully understand what they have built.
*   The consensus leans toward agreement with Jellyfin: if you cannot articulate what your code does or why it is necessary, you likely do not understand it well enough to contribute it.

**Distinction Between Code and Text**
While there was near-universal agreement that "vibe coding" (blindly trusting AI code) is bad, the friction lies in the "no AI communications" rule. Some feel strict enforcement against grammar-checking tools is too harsh, while others believe that the "unresolved cognitive dissonance" of letting AI write code while banning it from explaining that code makes the policy logically consistent.

### The new era of browsing: Putting Gemini to work in Chrome

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/products-and-platforms/products/chrome/gemini-3-auto-browse/) | 21 points | by [xnx](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=xnx) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799289)

Google is turning Chrome into an AI copilot powered by Gemini 3. Highlights:

- New side panel assistant: Gemini now lives in a persistent side panel so you can multitask without switching tabs—summarize pages, compare options, wrangle calendars, and more.
- On-the-fly image edits: “Nano Banana” lets you transform images directly on the page via prompts (no downloading/re-uploading).
- Connected Apps: Deeper integrations with Gmail, Calendar, YouTube, Maps, Shopping, and Flights. Examples include pulling event details from email, checking flight options, then drafting a note to teammates.
- Personal Intelligence (coming months): Opt-in memory and preferences for context-aware, proactive help across browsing. You can connect/disconnect apps and set custom instructions.
- Auto browse (agentic actions): For AI Pro/Ultra subscribers in the U.S., Chrome can handle multi-step chores—trip planning across dates, scheduling, form-filling, gathering tax docs, getting service quotes, subscription management, even shopping from a reference photo with budgets and discount codes. With permission, it can use Google Password Manager for sign-ins.

Why it matters:
- Pushes Chrome from “tool” to “agent,” competing with Microsoft’s Copilot in Edge and emerging agentic browsers.
- Big productivity upside, but raises familiar questions: privacy (what data powers context), safety (auto form-filling), and ecosystem lock-in via Connected Apps.
- Subscription gating (AI Pro/Ultra) puts the most powerful agentic features behind a paywall.

Availability:
- Gemini in Chrome on macOS, Windows, and Chromebook Plus. Side panel and image transforms available to all Gemini-in-Chrome users; Personal Intelligence rolls out in the coming months; Auto browse limited to U.S. AI Pro/Ultra.

**The Discussion**

Commenters viewed Google’s shift toward "agentic browsing" as a forced integration of LLMs, drawing negative comparisons to Microsoft’s strategy with Copilot. Skepticism ran high regarding the target audience; some noted that the Hacker News community has likely already abandoned Chrome due to the Manifest V3 controversy (which impacts ad blockers). Others wasted no time asking how to disable the new features entirely.

### Kairos: AI interns for everyone

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kairos.computer/) | 30 points | by [bamitsmanas](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bamitsmanas) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46792225)

What’s new: Kairos pitches a doer, not a chatter—an agent with its own browser that logs into sites (even behind logins), clicks buttons, fills forms, and ships results across your stack.

Highlights
- 20+ native integrations: Gmail, Calendar, Slack, GitHub, Notion, Sheets, Outlook, HubSpot, Linear, Airtable, Drive/Docs, Teams, Zoom, Dropbox, Box, Calendly, Twitter/Reddit, and more.
- Runs while you’re away: schedule tasks or set triggers; delivers reports, summaries, and proposals.
- End‑to‑end workflows: e.g., find YC AI startups → enrich via LinkedIn → filter/process → sync to Airtable → post a Slack report.
- Real-world ops: auto‑screen candidates in Greenhouse and book screens; scan inbox for refund requests and act per policy; find mutual availability via Calendly and your calendar.
- Teach by demo: share your screen once; it learns the steps and automates thereafter.

Positioning: “ChatGPT talks. Kairos does.” It emphasizes agentic browsing plus app orchestration over pure chat.

Pricing
- Free: a handful of tasks, SMS/WhatsApp messaging, all integrations, scheduled/recurring tasks, priority support.
- Plus: $37/month for higher limits; includes the same integrations and scheduling.

Open questions for HN readers
- Security and access: how are credentials handled, 2FA/session persistence, audit logs, and data boundaries across apps?
- Reliability: how it copes with changing UIs, anti-bot measures, rate limits, and long‑running tasks.
- Scope: which tasks are truly hands‑off vs needing human-in-the-loop review, and how errors are surfaced and corrected.

**The Top Story:**
**Kairos: An “AI Intern” That Automates Browser Workflows**

Today’s discussion focused on Kairos, a new entrant in the "agentic AI" space. Unlike standard LLMs that just chat, Kairos positions itself as a "doer" that can navigate the web, log into accounts (Gmail, Slack, HubSpot, etc.), and execute multi-step workflows like candidate screening or expense reporting.

**The Discussion:**
The HN community put the "intern" through a rigorous performance review, ranging from semantic debates to live technical stress tests.

*   **The "Intern" Semantics:** The branding sparked immediate debate. Some users felt the term "intern" implies sub-par work or misses the point of internships (talent development, not just cheap labor). Others maintained that "sub-par" labor is exactly what businesses try to automate—specifically the "TPS report" style data entry that humans hate. However, one commenter noted that manually filling out forms often provides necessary mental context that gets lost when automated.
*   **Performance Review (The Birdwatcher Test):** In the most substantial critique, user `bwstrgrd` tested Kairos on a specific task: finding rare bird sightings on eBird. results were mixed. The agent struggled to navigate the site efficiently, "reinvented the wheel" by creating a complex search plan, took eight minutes to execute, and returned results that were less accurate than a quick Google search. The creator (`bmtsmns`) was active in the thread, acknowledging the feedback and limitations regarding specific niche tasks.
*   **UX and Naming Collisions:** Several users complained about "scroll-jacking" on the landing page, calling it an immediate bounce factor. Others pointed out confusion with an existing Kubernetes distribution also named Kairos.
*   **Trust and Accountability:** The "intern" metaphor broke down for some regarding supervision. Users noted that human interns are supervised in real-time, whereas an AI agent executing tasks in the background creates anxiety about accountability and potential "runaway" errors within sensitive accounts.

### Please don't say mean things about the AI I just invested a billion dollars in

#### [Submission URL](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/please-dont-say-mean-things-about-the-ai-that-i-just-invested-a-billion-dollars-in) | 614 points | by [randycupertino](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=randycupertino) | [282 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46803356)

The story: A sharp McSweeney’s satire by Forest Abruzzo channels a thin-skinned tech billionaire pleading with the public to stop criticizing AI—while openly listing its worst externalities. In a breathless defense, the narrator proclaims AI “the most essential tool in human history” even as he concedes it enables scams, deepfakes, job loss, copyright scraping, surveillance creep, school degradation, and autonomous weapons. The bit riffs on a recent “stop being so negative about AI” news cycle, lampooning the industry’s PR spin and wounded-ego posture.

Why it matters: It captures a growing cultural backlash to AI boosterism and the gap between lofty promises and real harms. For builders and policymakers, it’s a reminder that trust, consent, safety, and accountability aren’t PR problems—they’re product requirements.

HN angles to watch:
- Is this satire a fair critique or a strawman?
- Training data consent/copyright, deepfake harms, and regulation
- Energy/compute costs vs. benefits
- The tech industry’s sensitivity to criticism and credibility gap

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments on Hacker News:

**The Purpose of a System**
A central theme of the thread revolves around the systems thinking aphorism "the purpose of a system is what it does." Commenters debated whether the high-minded intentions of AI creators matter if the practical, dominant outputs of the technology are spam, deepfakes, and astroturfing. Several users argued that if AI’s "steady state" outcome is chaos and harm, that is its engineering purpose, regardless of intent. This led to comparisons with the internet—specifically whether AI is simply a new medium for old human behaviors or if it fundamentally alters the landscape by driving the cost of generating "infinite torrents" of noise and harassment to zero.

**Supercharging Scams**
The satire’s point about scamming the elderly resonated deeply, moving from abstract debate to concrete examples. Users shared anecdotes of AI-cloned voice scams targeting grandparents (faking emergencies) and romance scams involving cloned audio of influencers (citing a specific case involving a Brazilian TikToker). The consensus among these commenters is that AI acts as a "force multiplier" for bad actors, allowing scams to scale rapidly in a way that previous technologies did not. Some pushed back with the "guns don't kill people" argument, but others retorted that when a tool makes crime this efficient, the tool itself warrants scrutiny.

**Harms vs. Utility**
While a few users defended the technology by citing benefits like coding assistance and accessibility, the prevailing sentiment in the thread leaned toward the article's critique. Users listed non-consensual sexual imagery, copyright theft, and the degradation of online trust as immediate, tangible harms that currently outweigh potential future benefits. One commenter described AI not as a tool but as an "information nuclear reactor" spewing radioactive material (spam/slop) that is poisoning the internet.

**The "Internet Analogy" Dispute**
There was significant pushback against the idea that the internet had a similarly "rocky start." Users argued that while the internet facilitated malware and flame wars, AI’s current trajectory creates different, more invasive problems—specifically the inability to distinguish truth from fiction and the massive scale of automated harassment. The comparison was generally viewed as a failure to appreciate the specific, accelerating nature of AI risks.

### Show HN: I'm building an AI-proof writing tool. How would you defeat it?

#### [Submission URL](https://auth-auth.vercel.app/) | 10 points | by [callmeed](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=callmeed) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46799402)

Authentic Author is a browser-based writing tool that tries to verify human authorship by focusing on how text is produced, not just what it says. It gives users a prompt and requires them to write 1–2 paragraphs directly in its editor, disabling paste and common DOM tricks. Behind the scenes it records typing cadence, pauses, tab switches, and window focus changes, then outputs an “Authenticity Score” estimating the likelihood the text was originally written by a human.

The pitch targets classrooms and hiring screens battling AI-written submissions, shifting detection from content analysis to process telemetry. That could deter casual misuse, but it also raises privacy and fairness questions: keystroke-level tracking can feel invasive, and scoring may penalize slow typists, non-native speakers, or people using assistive tools. As with any anti-cheat system, workarounds (e.g., scripted keystrokes or human relays) are possible, but the approach highlights a growing trend toward provenance-by-process rather than post-hoc AI detection.

The discussion on Hacker News focused on the ease of circumventing "telemetry-based" detection, with users largely dismissing the tool's effectiveness against determined attempts to cheat.

**Key themes in the conversation included:**

*   **Trivial Technical Workarounds:** Users quickly demonstrated how to fool the system. One user (`ephou7`) wrote a simple Python script using `xdotool` and random sleep intervals to simulate human typing, achieving an "Authenticity Score" of 81. Others mentioned existing automation tools and OCR scripts that can read a prompt, query an LLM, and inject the text with simulated keystrokes.
*   **The "Transcription" Loophole:** Several commenters validated that the tool checks *how* you type, not *what* you type. Users reported generating AI text on a second monitor, phone, or separate browser window and manually typing it into the editor.
    *   User `jryan49` manually typed a response from Gemini and scored "100% genuine."
    *   User `JoshuaDavid` transcribed what they described as "obvious Claude slop" and still received an 87% authenticity rating.
*   **Hardware Spoofing:** The discussion extended to hardware solutions, noting that cheap programmable USB dongles (microcontrollers) can emulate a keyboard to input AI-generated text, making it indistinguishable from a human typist at the driver level.
*   **The Return to Analog:** The consensus was that digital verification is futile against AI. Commenters argued that the only truly "AI-proof" writing environments are physical "blue book" exams, pen and paper, or strictly invigilated offline rooms.

### AI2: Open Coding Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://allenai.org/blog/open-coding-agents) | 225 points | by [publicmatt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=publicmatt) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46783017)

Open Coding Agents (AI2): SERA open models + a cheap, reproducible recipe to adapt coding agents to any repo

- What’s new: AI2 released SERA (Soft-verified Efficient Repository Agents) and a fully open pipeline—models, training data, recipes, and a one-line launcher/CLI (PyPI)—to build and fine‑tune coding agents for your own codebase. Works out of the box with Claude Code.

- Performance: SERA-32B solves 54.2% on SWE-Bench Verified, edging prior open-source peers of similar size/context. Trained in ~40 GPU-days; they say reproducing prior open SOTA costs ~$400, and ~$12k can rival top industry models of the same size.

- Key idea: “Soft-verified generation” (SVG) for synthetic data—patches don’t need to be fully correct to be useful—plus a “bug-type menu” to scale/diversify data. They report SOTA open-source results at a fraction of typical costs.

- Efficiency claims: Matches SWE-smith at ~57× lower cost and SkyRL at ~26× lower cost. Fine-tuning on private code reportedly lets SERA-32B surpass its 110B teacher (GLM-4.5-Air) on repos like Django/Sympy after ~8k samples (~$1.3k).

- Inference throughput (NVIDIA-optimized): ~1,950 tok/s (BF16, 4×H100), ~3,700 tok/s (FP8), and ~8,600 tok/s on next‑gen 4×B200 (NVFP4), with minimal accuracy drop at lower precision.

- Why it matters: Puts strong, repo-aware coding agents within reach for small teams—no large-scale RL stack required—while keeping the models and data open for inspection and iteration.

Notes/caveats:
- Results center on SWE-Bench Verified; real-world repo adaptation and privacy/process for generating synthetic data from private code merit scrutiny.
- Cost/speed numbers depend on specific NVIDIA hardware and settings.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Comparisons and Performance Claims**
The most active debate concerned whether SERA truly reclaims the open-source SOTA title. Users pointed to Meta’s CWM models, which reportedly achieve higher scores (65% on SWE-bench Verified) when using Test-Time Selection (TTS). A discussion participant (likely a paper author) pushed back, arguing that TTS adds significant latency and cost, making it impractical for local deployment. They emphasized that SERA is optimized for efficiency and lower context lengths (32k/64k) compared to the hardware-intensive requirements of rival models.

**Openness and Licensing**
Commenters distinguished between "open weights" and "open science." While models like Mistral Small 2 and Meta’s CWM have open weights, users noted that Meta’s license restricts commercial use and does not disclose training data. In contrast, AI2 was praised for releasing the full pipeline, including training data and the recipe for synthetic data generation, allowing for genuine reproducibility and commercial application.

**Terminology: "Agent" vs. "LLM"**
There was significant semantic pushback regarding the use of the term "Agent." Users argued that an LLM itself is not an agent; rather, an agent is the combination of an LLM plus a scaffolding/harness (a loop to execute tasks). Others suggested a distinction between "Agentic LLMs" (models fine-tuned for reasoning and tool-calling) and the broader systems that utilize them.

**Fine-Tuning vs. Context Window**
Users debated the practical utility of fine-tuning a 32B model on a specific repository versus using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with a massive context window on a frontier model (like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5).
*   **Skeptics** argued that intelligent context management with a smarter model is usually superior to fine-tuning a "dumber" model.
*   **Proponents** (one claiming to work on the "world's largest codebase") countered that fine-tuning is essential for proprietary internal libraries and syntax that general models cannot infer, even with large context windows.

**Miscellaneous**
*   **Claude Code Integration:** Some users were confused by the claim that the system requires Claude Code to run; others clarified that Claude Code is simply the harness/CLI being supported out of the box, while other open harnesses (like OpenCode or Cline) could also be used.
*   **Speed:** The inference speed (up to ~8,600 tok/s on B200s) was highlighted as a major advantage, though some questioned the specific hardware dependencies.
*   **Technique:** The synthetic data generation method—extracting tests from PR diffs and having the model reconstruct the patch—was noted as a clever approach to scaling training data.

### Management as AI superpower: Thriving in a world of agentic AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.oneusefulthing.org/p/management-as-ai-superpower) | 94 points | by [swolpers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=swolpers) | [87 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46782811)

Ethan Mollick recounts an experiment at Wharton: executive MBA students used agentic AI tools (Claude Code, Google Antigravity, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to go from zero to working startup prototypes in four days. Results were roughly a semester’s worth of progress pre‑AI: real core features, sharper market analyses, and easier pivots. Example demos included Ticket Passport (verified ticket resale), Revenue Resilience (at‑risk revenue detection with agentic remediation), a parenting activity matcher, and Invive (blood sugar prediction).

The bigger point: management—clear goals, constraints, and evaluation—has become the AI superpower. Mollick offers a mental model for deciding when to hand work to AI:
- Human Baseline Time: how long you’d take to do the task yourself
- Probability of Success: chance the AI meets your quality bar per attempt
- AI Process Time: time to prompt, wait, and verify each AI output

You’re trading “doing the whole task” vs. “paying overhead” potentially multiple times. If the task is long, AI is fast and cheap, and the success probability is high enough, delegate. If checking takes long and success is low, just do it yourself. He ties this to OpenAI’s GDPval study: experts took ~7 hours; AI was minutes to generate but ~1 hour to verify—so the tipping point depends on model quality and your acceptance bar.

Why HN cares
- Practical rubric for real work: when AI accelerates vs. wastes time
- Emphasis on evaluation as the scarce skill, not prompting tricks
- Lower pivot costs enable broader exploration and parallel bets
- Caveats: jagged frontier unpredictability, verification overhead, domain/regulatory risk, and the danger of over‑delegation without subject‑matter judgment

**Is writing code still the bottleneck?**
A contentious debate emerged regarding the author’s premise that code generation is no longer the limiting factor in software development. While some agreed that the bottleneck has shifted to "deciding what to build," specification, and review, many argued that the true constraint remains visualizing complex systems, debugging, and managing architecture in medium-to-large codebases—tasks where AI agents frequently fail due to context window limitations and a lack of holistic understanding.

**The "Mental Model" Deficit**
A recurring critique focused on the trade-off between speed and comprehension. Commenters noted that writing code is how engineers build a mental model of the system. By delegating implementation to AI, developers risk losing the deep understanding required to debug subtle failures or make architectural decisions later. This led to concerns that AI speed is illusory, merely shifting time saved on typing toward "paying overhead" on reading, validating, and fixing "myopic" AI error corrections that introduce technical debt.

**The shift from "Builder" to "Reviewer"**
Discussion highlighted the psychological toll of this shift. Several users argued that "managing" AI strips away the creative, satisfying parts of engineering (building), leaving humans with the "grind" of tedious verification, cleanup, and orchestration—work described by some as mind-numbing. Others pointed out that unlike managing human juniors, managing AI lacks the rewarding aspect of mentorship and teaching soft skills.

**Enforcement and Verification**
Participants noted that if AI is treated as a "junior" or a force multiplier, the reliance on automated enforcement (linting, tests, strict architectural boundaries) must increase drastically. Because AI does not "learn" best practices deeply and can hallucinate valid-looking but broken structures, human reviewers must implement rigorous automated checks to prevent a collapse in code quality.

### Kimi Released Kimi K2.5, Open-Source Visual SOTA-Agentic Model

#### [Submission URL](https://www.kimi.com/blog/kimi-k2-5.html) | 483 points | by [nekofneko](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nekofneko) | [227 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46775961)

What’s new
- Native multimodal model trained on ~15T mixed vision/text tokens; pitched as the most powerful open-source model to date.
- Strong coding + vision focus: image/video-to-code, visual debugging, and reasoning over visual puzzles. Demos include reconstructing sites from video and generating animated front‑end UIs from a single prompt.
- “Agent Swarm” paradigm: K2.5 can self-orchestrate up to 100 sub‑agents and ~1,500 tool calls in parallel, claiming up to 4.5x faster execution vs single‑agent runs. No predefined roles; the model decomposes and schedules work itself.

How the swarm works (research preview)
- Trained via Parallel-Agent Reinforcement Learning (PARL) with a learned orchestrator and frozen sub‑agents.
- Uses staged reward shaping to avoid “serial collapse” (falling back to single‑agent). Introduces a “Critical Steps” metric to optimize the critical path rather than raw step count.
- Reported gains on complex, parallelizable tasks and strong scores on agentic benchmarks (HLE, BrowseComp, SWE‑Verified) at lower cost.

Coding with vision
- Emphasis on front‑end generation and visual reasoning to lower the gap from mockups/video to working code.
- Autonomous visual debugging: the model inspects its own outputs, consults docs, and iterates without handholding.
- Internal “Kimi Code Bench” shows step‑up over K2 on build/debug/refactor/test tasks across languages.

Ecosystem and availability
- Access via Kimi.com, Kimi App, API, and Kimi Code.
- Four modes: K2.5 Instant, Thinking, Agent, and Agent Swarm (Beta). Swarm is in beta on Kimi.com with free credits for higher‑tier paid users.
- Kimi Code: open‑source terminal/IDE tooling (VSCode, Cursor, Zed, etc.), supports image/video inputs, and auto‑discovers/migrates existing “skills” and MCPs into your setup.

Why it matters
- Pushes the frontier on practical multimodal coding and parallel agent execution—two areas with big latency and productivity payoffs for real software work.
- If the “self‑directed swarm” generalizes, it could make agent workflows faster and less brittle than hand‑crafted role trees.

Caveats to watch
- Benchmarks and demos can overfit; real‑world reliability, tool integration quirks, and cost at scale remain to be seen.
- “Open‑source” claims often hinge on licensing/weights availability—expect scrutiny on what exactly is released and under what terms.
- Swarm benefits depend on tasks that truly parallelize; sequential or tightly coupled tasks won’t see the same speedups.

How to try
- Experiment with K2.5 Agent/Swarm on Kimi.com (beta) and wire up Kimi Code in your terminal/IDE for image/video‑to‑code and autonomous debugging workflows.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the comments regarding the Kimi K2.5 submission:

**Hardware Feasibility & Requirements**
The primary topic of debate is the feasibility of running a 1-trillion parameter model (even with only 32B active parameters) on local hardware.
*   **The VRAM Bottleneck:** Users noted that even with Int4 quantization, a 1T parameter model requires approximately 500GB of VRAM, which is prohibitively expensive for most consumers.
*   **MoE Architecture:** Defenders of the "local" potential argued that because it is a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model, compute requirements are lower (only 32B active parameters per token). However, the total VRAM capacity remains the hard constraint.
*   **High-End Consumer Gear:** Some suggested that high-end consumer hardware (like Mac Studios with unified memory or PCs with the upcoming Strix Halo) might handle the *active* parameter load, but storing the full model remains a challenge without massive memory pools.

**Quantization & Model Quality**
There was significant skepticism regarding how much the model must be compressed to be usable.
*   **Quantization Trade-offs:** Users debated whether a massive model heavily quantized (to 4-bit or 2-bit) performs better than a smaller model running at higher precision. Some reported that while benchmarks might survive quantization, real-world usage often suffers from "death spirals" (repetitive loops) or logic failures.
*   **BitNet & Future Tech:** The discussion touched on recent research (like BitNet/1.58-bit models) and whether Kimi uses post-training quantization vs. quantization-aware training.
*   **Hardware Support:** It was noted that running Int4 effectively requires hardware that natively supports the format; otherwise, the hardware wastes throughput unpacking the data.

**System Architecture & OS Limitations**
*   **Memory Offloading:** The viability of keeping the model on SSDs and swapping "experts" into RAM was debated. Experts argued that because expert activation is often random (low locality), SSD latency would make inference unacceptably slow.
*   **Windows vs. Linux:** One user argued that for consumer Nvidia cards (e.g., RTX 3000 series), Windows currently handles shared memory (using system RAM as VRAM overflow) better than Linux drivers, which were described as unstable or difficult to configure for this specific use case.

**Defining "Local"**
A philosophical disagreement emerged regarding what "running locally" means.
*   Some users feel "local LLM" implies standard consumer hardware (gaming PCs/laptops).
*   Others argued that any model running on on-premise hardware (even a $20k server cluster) counts as local, distinguishing it from API-only services.

### LLM-as-a-Courtroom

#### [Submission URL](https://falconer.com/notes/llm-as-a-courtroom/) | 67 points | by [jmtulloss](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jmtulloss) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46784210)

Falconer: an “LLM-as-a-Courtroom” to fight documentation rot

Falconer is tackling the classic “documentation rot” problem—code evolves, docs don’t—by auto-proposing and updating internal docs when PRs merge. The hard part isn’t search; it’s trust: knowing which documents truly need updates, for which audiences, and why. After finding that simple categorical scoring (e.g., relevance 7/10) produced inconsistent, unjustified decisions, the team built a courtroom-style judgment engine: one agent prosecutes (argues to update), another defends (argues to skip), a jury deliberates, and a judge rules—creating a reasoned, auditable trail.

Why it matters:
- Turns LLMs from unreliable “raters” into structured debaters that provide evidence and rationale.
- Handles cross-functional nuance (what’s critical for support may be irrelevant for engineering).
- Scales to tens of thousands of PRs daily for enterprise teams.
- Improves trust and maintainability by coupling automation with explainability, not just findability.

The discussion around Falconer focused on the necessity of its complex architecture, the economics of running multi-agent systems, and philosophical debates regarding LLM "understanding."

**The "Courtroom" vs. Simple Scoring**
Several users questioned whether a complex adversarial system was necessary, suggesting that Occam's Razor favors simpler metrics, binary log probabilities, or standard human review. The authors responded that they initially tried simple 1–10 relevance scoring but found the results inconsistent. They argued that LLMs perform better when tasked with arguing a specific position (prosecution/defense) rather than assigning abstract numerical values to nuanced documentation changes that are rarely strictly "true" or "false."

**Cost, Latency, and the "Funnel"**
Commenters expressed concern about the token costs and latency of running multiple agents (prosecutor, defense, five jurors, judge) for every Pull Request. The creators clarified that the "courtroom" is the final step of a funnel, not the default path:
*   **65%** of PRs are filtered out by simple heuristics before review begins.
*   **95%** of the remaining are decided by single agents (prosecutors deciding whether to file charges).
*   Only **1–2%** of ambiguous cases trigger the full, expensive adversarial pipeline.

**Philosophy vs. Utility**
A segment of the discussion devolved into the "Chinese Room" argument. Skeptics argued that LLMs cannot effectively judge context because they lack human experience and true understanding, merely processing symbols. Pragmatists pushed back, noting that if the system achieves the claimed **83% success rate**, it is practically useful regardless of whether the model possesses philosophical "understanding."

**Other Notes**
*   One user shared their own experiment with a "mediation" framework, noting that while litigation seeks truth/justice, mediation seeks resolution—a subtle but interesting difference in agent goal-setting.
*   The thread contained several humorous "courtroom transcript" parodies involving LLM jailbreaks and the "Chewbacca defense."
