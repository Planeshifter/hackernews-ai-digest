With many parents expressing sadness over the impending loss of their children’s favorite robotic companion, it’s a bittersweet moment. Though Embodied's move is commendable compared to other tech firms that have rendered products useless without support, the situation underscores growing concerns about the sustainability of tech investments.

The discussion surrounding the Embodied announcement yielded a mix of sentiments and topics related to technology, robotics, and user experiences. Some commenters expressed frustration about the limitations in the technology sector, particularly in relation to the dependency on cloud services for devices like Moxie. There was a critique of telecommunications companies and their failure to adequately service customers while retaining control over service infrastructure.

A few users highlighted the broader implications of the closure, comparing it to other companies' failures in maintaining support for products and devices, emphasizing the emotional impact on families who invested in Moxie, likening it to earlier experiences with products like Lego’s Mindstorms.

There were also mentions of bankruptcy proceedings and the importance of intellectual property continuity in these scenarios, as users navigated the implications of losing support for devices that rely on continuous service.

Overall, the conversation reflected a blend of nostalgia, critique of the tech industry's trends, and concern for the future usability of robotics and connected devices.
