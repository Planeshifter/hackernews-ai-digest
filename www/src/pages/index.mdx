The latest release by Stability AI, the Stable Diffusion 3 Medium, has stirred up quite a storm in the AI image-synthesis community. While this model promises to turn text prompts into AI-generated images, users have been left disappointed by the strange and often anatomically incorrect outputs it produces, especially when it comes to rendering human figures.

Reddit threads have popped up showcasing the comical yet flawed images generated by SD3 Medium, with users pointing out the model's struggles with details like hands and feet. The community, once impressed by Stability AI's advancements, now views this release as a regression compared to previous models like Midjourney or DALL-E 3.

The root of the issue seems to lie in Stability's decision to filter out adult content from the training data, inadvertently resulting in a lack of diverse human anatomy examples. This has led to bizarre interpretations of user prompts, producing images that range from amusing to downright terrifying.

As users experiment with the model on platforms like Hugging Face, they continue to encounter similar issues, reinforcing the disappointment surrounding Stable Diffusion 3 Medium. These struggles with the model's output have only exacerbated concerns about Stability AI's internal challenges, including recent leadership changes and financial troubles.

For now, enthusiasts are left questioning the future of Stability AI and its image-synthesis capabilities, as the release of SD3 Medium fails to meet the high expectations set by previous models.

### How Amazon blew Alexa's shot to dominate AI, according to employees worked on it

#### [Submission URL](https://fortune.com/2024/06/12/amazon-insiders-why-new-alexa-llm-generative-ai-conversational-chatbot-missing-in-action/) | 20 points | by [firstSpeaker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=firstSpeaker) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40674104)

In a bid to revolutionize Amazon's Alexa, a new generative AI-powered version was unveiled in September 2023, promising a more natural and conversational interaction. However, according to insiders, the launch has been marred by delays and organizational challenges, with the new Alexa still not ready for prime time. Former employees paint a picture of Amazon struggling to keep up with Big Tech rivals in the AI race, citing structural dysfunction and technological hurdles.

Meanwhile, Apple has made strides in the generative AI space with recent announcements at its WWDC conference, showcasing upgrades for Siri and a partnership with OpenAI. This puts pressure on Amazon to deliver its revamped Alexa. Despite high expectations, it seems Amazon is facing setbacks in transitioning its digital assistant to compete in the evolving AI landscape.

There are various opinions shared by Hacker News users about the submission regarding Amazon's Alexa and generative AI technology:

1. User "rghthnd" implies that current AI companies are taking profitability factors for granted, resulting in a revenue stream path. They mention dumping data, Long-Short Term Memory (LLMs), clever statistics, and reference Amazon's business stock landing roles regarding technology products and hardware.

2. User "rdtsc" jokes about the need to work harder and talks about the message magic of LLMDoes Prasad, making a comparison to Michael Scott from The Office TV show.

3. User "hlssn" shares a link, but it appears to be paywalled. They suggest searching Google with the provided title to find information related to Amazon's Alexa and the dominance of AI according to a dozen employees who worked at Amazon.

4. User "fkjslt" simply comments "dd," which could indicate agreement or acknowledgment of the points discussed in the thread.

### Can LLMs invent better ways to train LLMs?

#### [Submission URL](https://sakana.ai/llm-squared/) | 59 points | by [hardmaru](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hardmaru) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40665194)

At Sakana AI, they are pushing the boundaries of AI research by leveraging evolutionary optimization and Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate the process of developing cutting-edge foundation models. In their recent paper, they introduce a novel approach called LLM² (‘LLM-squared’) where LLMs are used for self-referential improvement in discovering preference optimization algorithms. By using LLMs to propose and implement new preference optimization loss functions, they have discovered a state-of-the-art algorithm named DiscoPOP that outperforms existing methods. This breakthrough not only minimizes human intervention in AI research but also opens up new possibilities for enhancing LLM capabilities in various applications. Collaborating with prestigious universities, Sakana AI has released their report and open-sourced the discovery process code, signaling a significant leap in AI innovation that promises to revolutionize the field.

### An Empirical Study of Mamba-Based Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07887) | 42 points | by [panabee](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=panabee) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40672606)

A recent arXiv submission titled "An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models" by Roger Waleffe and a team of 15 other authors delves into the realm of Selective State-Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba, comparing them with Transformers in language modeling. The study explores the performance of 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, Transformer models, and a hybrid architecture on various tasks and datasets up to 3.5T tokens. The results indicate that while pure SSMs can outperform Transformers on many tasks, they struggle with tasks requiring strong copying abilities or long-context reasoning. Interestingly, the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid model surpasses the 8B Transformer on all evaluated tasks and is predicted to be significantly faster in token generation at inference time. The study also includes experiments on long-context tasks, showing the hybrid model matching or exceeding the Transformer on average. The research aims to shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of different architectures, providing insights for further exploration in the field of machine learning.

The discussion revolves around the comparison between Mamba models and Transformers based on their sizes and parameter counts. One user wonders about the largest Mamba model trained so far and notes that Mamba models appear to scale better than Transformers based on their experiments. Another user shares their experience with training large language models, stating that rapid improvements were seen when training higher-capacity models. They express regret at not investing more resources into training larger models sooner. Additionally, there is a mention of the difficulty in long-context tasks and the potential benefits of using Mamba models for such tasks. A response to this touches on the apparent analytical theory behind the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Mamba, highlighting the trade-offs in scaling and the advantages for long-context tasks.
