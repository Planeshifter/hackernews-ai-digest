The Cradle framework, a groundbreaking project in the field of artificial intelligence, aims to empower foundation agents to achieve general computer control. By providing a unified interface where agents receive visual input from screens and perform actions using keyboard and mouse operations, Cradle enables agents to interact with any software or game without relying on specific APIs. This framework has shown remarkable generalizability and impressive performance across a variety of tasks, including navigating complex video games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and completing various software applications efficiently.

By leveraging a modular and flexible approach with six key components - Information Gathering, Self-Reflection, Task Inference, Skill Curation, Action Planning, and Memory - Cradle demonstrates the potential for agents to excel in diverse virtual environments. The use of advanced technologies like GPT-4o as the backbone model further enhances the framework's vision and reasoning capabilities.

With the goal of achieving General Computer Control (GCC) and enabling agents to master any computer task, Cradle paves the way for a new era of AI capabilities. By offering a standardized interface for interaction and focusing on efficient exploration and self-improvement, this framework opens up possibilities for agents to excel in navigating the digital world.
