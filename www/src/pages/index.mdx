### Human coders are still better than LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://antirez.com/news/153) | 561 points | by [longwave](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=longwave) | [665 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44127739)

In the ever-evolving world of AI and software development, human coders remain a step ahead of Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini 2.5 PRO, at least for now. A recent real-world case illustrates this dynamic beautifully. The problem at hand involved a complex bug fix within Vector Sets for Redis, tied to how corrupted data could disrupt node links in Redis' graph serialization approach.

After discovering that the vanilla solution slowed down loading times significantly, the coder turned to Gemini for advice on optimizing speed. However, responses from the AI were less insightful than hoped, suggesting only basic adjustments like ordering pointers for binary search.

The coder's creative thinking, something AI hasn't quite mastered, played a crucial role. They proposed an innovative solution involving a hash-based method to check for non-reciprocal links, which the AI could appreciate but not improve upon. Further refinement led to using an XOR-based method with a fixed accumulator to detect anomalies—a technique cautious of potential data collisions.

Seeing potential risks, the coder incorporated a hash function with a random seed to reduce collision chances further, achieving a level of robustness that could thwart even deliberate attacks.

This story reaffirms that while LLMs serve as valuable tools, providing suggestions and alternate perspectives, the intricate problem-solving and intuition of human developers remain unmatched. AI complements but does not yet replace our analytical prowess, particularly in complex or security-sensitive tasks.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores the strengths and limitations of LLMs (like ChatGPT) in software development and problem-solving, with mixed perspectives:  

### **Key Criticisms of LLMs:**
1. **Unreliability for "Blank Page" Problems**:  
   - LLMs struggle with undefined or open-ended tasks (e.g., starting from scratch, complex design decisions). Users noted they often produce plausible-sounding but incorrect answers, requiring significant human verification.  
   - Example: Translating assembly code or solving novel issues often still demands human expertise.  

2. **Hallucinations and Inaccuracies**:  
   - LLMs sometimes invent nonexistent libraries (e.g., npm packages) or misinterpret technical terms, forcing developers to double-check outputs.  
   - One user described frustration with ChatGPT inventing a "PiicoDev_SlidePot" class that didn’t exist.  

3. **Search Engine Limitations**:  
   - LLMs are seen as inferior to traditional search engines (even older ones like 2005-era Google) for factual queries. Conversational interfaces lack the skepticism users apply to search results, and SEO spam/SEO-optimized content degrades reliability.  

4. **Prompt Engineering Challenges**:  
   - While detailed prompts improve results, LLMs may still make arbitrary design choices. Users emphasized that even "perfect" prompts don’t guarantee accuracy, requiring iterative refinement.  

---

### **LLM Strengths and Use Cases**:  
1. **Productivity Boost for Tedious Tasks**:  
   - Automating boilerplate code (e.g., mapping functions between data types), writing small scripts, or generating documentation saves time.  
   - Example: An LLM reliably converting `protoFooID` to `gomodelFooID` reduced manual work by ~50%.  

2. **ADHD and Workflow Support**:  
   - Developers with ADHD found LLMs helpful for overcoming "blank page paralysis" or hyperfocusing on minor details (e.g., variable naming).  

3. **Learning and Prototyping**:  
   - LLMs accelerate exploration of new APIs, libraries, or concepts, acting as a conversational guide.  

---

### **Broader Sentiment**:  
- **LLMs as Tools, Not Replacements**: Most agreed LLMs are valuable assistants but lack human intuition, creativity, and critical thinking for complex, security-sensitive, or undefined tasks.  
- **Hybrid Workflows**: Developers often combine LLMs with traditional methods (e.g., writing code with AI, then testing/debugging manually).  
- **Future Concerns**: Some worry about over-reliance on LLMs for junior developers, potentially hindering growth in problem-solving skills.  

**Conclusion**: While LLMs enhance productivity and reduce grunt work, their limitations necessitate human oversight, especially for high-stakes or novel challenges. The consensus is pragmatic—embrace LLMs for efficiency but remain vigilant about their shortcomings.

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.skyvern.com/web-bench-a-new-way-to-compare-ai-browser-agents/) | 31 points | by [suchintan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=suchintan) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44126725)

In the rapidly evolving world of web browsing agents, a new benchmark has emerged to push the boundaries of what these digital assistants can achieve. Introducing Web Bench, a pioneering dataset designed to rigorously evaluate AI web agents across 5,750 tasks on 452 diverse websites. This innovation significantly expands on the existing WebVoyager benchmark, which fell short with just 643 tasks on 15 sites, focusing heavily on reading tasks like data extraction.

Web Bench raises the bar by incorporating a crucial distinction between READ and WRITE tasks—where the latter includes more complex actions such as logging into accounts, filling out forms, and downloading files. The review of Web Bench's results reveals that current agents struggle most with these write-heavy challenges, highlighting a major opportunity for growth in the field. Among the contenders, Skyvern 2.0 excels in handling these tasks, while Anthropic's CUA leads in read-heavy scenarios.

The development of Web Bench is a collaboration with Halluminate, sorting through the top 1,000 traffic-heavy websites and refining the list to eliminate paywalled or redundant domains. The dataset creation involved rigorous testing using consistent browser infrastructures to control variables, allowing for a fair comparison of agent performance.

Despite the advancements, agents displayed notable shortcomings in write-heavy tasks due to navigation and information extraction issues, often faltering on seemingly simple website interactions like solving captchas or finding clickable buttons. These findings underscore the nuanced challenges of creating truly adept web browsing agents and suggest parallels to challenges faced by AI in other domains, such as coding.

As the landscape of AI browsing agents continues to mature, Web Bench stands as a critical tool to challenge the current limits and inspire innovations that might finally conquer these digital terrains. The dataset and its insights are open-source, inviting further exploration and refinement by the global developer community.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion highlights enthusiasm for the **Web Bench** benchmark's expansion over **WebVoyager**, particularly praising its broader scope (452 websites vs. 15) and real-world relevance. Users note that WebVoyager’s limited scale made it less practical, and expanding further (e.g., to 10,000 sites) could enhance benchmarking accuracy.  

**Key points raised:**  
1. **Technical Workflow Debate:** A user questions whether generic browser workflows (like Skyvern’s) are more effective than tools like Playwright for building web agents.  
2. **Benchmark Gaps:** Commenters emphasize that existing benchmarks lack complex end-to-end tests (e.g., logged-in dashboards, forms, 2FA flows), making Web Bench’s focus on these areas critical for real-world AI agent performance.  
3. **Community Appreciation:** Contributors thank the team for open-sourcing the dataset, with one noting its potential to advance AI QA testing.  
4. **Agent Performance:** Skyvern’s success in write-heavy tasks is acknowledged, while anticipation builds for future benchmarks involving Claude 4 or Anthropic’s CUA.  
5. **Humor & Critique:** A jest about “Nelly” scoring 0 on the benchmark sparks a redirect to the official repository, underscoring the community’s engagement.  

Overall, the discussion reflects optimism about Web Bench’s role in driving innovation, while stressing the need for even more comprehensive and nuanced testing frameworks.

### Untrusted chatbot AI between you & the internet is a disaster waiting to happen

#### [Submission URL](https://macwright.com/2025/05/29/putting-an-untrusted-chat-layer-is-a-disaster) | 105 points | by [panic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=panic) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44129529)

Imagine a future where every digital interaction is mediated by a chatbot, every purchase suggestion, and every piece of news tailored by an unseen hand. This scenario is more than a mere thought experiment; it's rapidly approaching reality, warns Tom MacWright, as companies like the Browser Company pivot towards chatbot-centric platforms like Dia. 

MacWright likens this trend to hiring a butler for all your digital needs—a move that seems convenient but eventually makes you vulnerable to manipulation both economically and ideologically. He points to current practices by tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft who unabashedly promote their own products in search results and recommendations, thanks to negligible regulatory consequences in the US.

However, the economic skew is just one aspect of this potentially dystopian picture. The subtler threat is ideological manipulation. Historical instances, detailed in exposés like "Careless People," reveal how platforms have already tweaked algorithms to favor certain voices. AI might exacerbate this issue, operating with greater efficiency and subtlety, and ultimately, working not for the user, but for those who program it.

MacWright’s message is clear: unless care is taken, this “butler” will not only start deciding what’s on the menu—but may eventually decide what you can and can't consume.

The Hacker News discussion around Tom MacWright’s warnings about AI-driven digital intermediation highlights several key concerns and debates:

### **1. AI Recommendations and Economic Bias**  
- Users note that people are increasingly accepting AI-generated answers (e.g., ChatGPT) for decisions like retail purchases, raising fears of economic manipulation. For example, a user shared an anecdote about retail workers using ChatGPT to manage sales and coupon codes.  
- Comparisons are drawn between AI-generated content and SEO spam, with some arguing both prioritize profit over quality: *“What’s the difference between LLM garbage and SEO garbage?”*  

---

### **2. Ideological Manipulation and Trust**  
- Skepticism about AI’s neutrality persists, with users pointing to historical examples (e.g., Google favoring its own products) and warning that AI could amplify propaganda or deceptive information.  
- Trust in corporations like Google is eroding: *“I don’t trust LLMs… they’re attached to companies that sell data to the highest bidder.”* Others argue AI could replicate the “invisible hand” myth, masking corporate agendas.  

---

### **3. Technical and Market Challenges**  
- Technical debates focus on the feasibility of decentralized, privacy-focused LLMs (e.g., encrypted prompts), but users question whether vendors would allow easy switching due to integration costs and proprietary lock-in.  
- Some predict AI intermediaries like ChatGPT could replace Google Search, but critics argue AI-generated content is just repackaged SEO tactics, creating a *“hellscape”* of low-quality, recycled posts.  

---

### **4. Social Media and AI-Generated Content**  
- Experiments to detect AI-generated comments on platforms like HN and Reddit reveal challenges in distinguishing human vs. synthetic content. Users note AI bots could manipulate discussions subtly, mimicking real engagement.  
- Concerns about AI-driven social media echo chambers and propaganda networks are likened to cable TV’s curated narratives: *“The dystopian internet is here.”*  

---

### **5. Regulatory and Ethical Gaps**  
- Many call for regulation to force transparency in AI recommendations (e.g., disclosing paid promotions), but others doubt enforcement will materialize.  
- Decentralized solutions (e.g., peer-to-peer search engines) are proposed, though skeptics argue they’re impractical without mainstream adoption.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
The discussion reflects widespread anxiety about AI centralizing power, eroding trust, and degrading information quality. While some see potential in technical fixes or regulation, others fear a future where AI intermediaries control access to knowledge, replicating—or worsening—existing flaws like SEO spam and corporate bias. As one user starkly put it: *“The AI dystopia is already happening.”*

### A visual exploration of vector embeddings

#### [Submission URL](http://blog.pamelafox.org/2025/05/a-visual-exploration-of-vector.html) | 22 points | by [pamelafox](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pamelafox) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44120306)

PyCon 2025 brought an insightful exploration into the fascinating world of vector embeddings, transforming complex poster visuals into a detailed, narrative-driven explanation. Let's break down what makes vector embeddings an essential tool in the machine learning landscape and how different models offer unique insights and utilize various similarity metrics.

### Vector Embeddings 101

At its core, a vector embedding translates an input (like a word or image) into a numerical list, representing that input in a multidimensional space. The list's length is the dimension count—imagine a vector embedding with 1024 dimensions as a 1024-entry list of numbers. This transformation enables models to process input data effectively, translating complex inputs into numerical forms that retain semantic significance.

### Notable Models and Their Characteristics

#### word2vec

Known for its simplicity and semantic prowess, word2vec was an early breakthrough model, outputting 300-dimensional vectors to represent single words. Despite its primary focus on single words, it remains accessible and easily trainable, often serving as a baseline in linguistic model development.

#### OpenAI's Contributions

**text-embedding-ada-002**: Released in 2022, this OpenAI model stands out for its efficiency and cost-effectiveness. It handles up to 8192 tokens and outputs vectors with 1536 dimensions. A peculiar downward spike at dimension 196 consistently appears across varied embeddings, raising questions about its internals.

**text-embedding-3-series**: Introduced in 2024, the text-embedding-3-small and large models improved upon their predecessor's cost and speed. Notably, the former avoids any significant peculiarities, displaying a balanced distribution of values across the vector dimensions.

### Exploring Similarity Spaces

Turning data into embeddings allows us to use distance metrics to compare inputs within "similarity spaces," unique to each model. Models should align their similarity estimations closely with human understanding. For instance, examining words' semantic proximity sheds light on model behavior:

- **word2vec similarity**: Shows semantic proximity with a spread between 0 and 0.76 in cosine similarity values.
- **text-embedding-ada-002 similarity**: Offers a narrow similarity range, from 0.75 to 0.88, connecting words like "dog" and "god" likely due to spelling resemblance rather than semantic similarity.
- **text-embedding-3-small similarity**: Reflects a wider distribution akin to word2vec, focusing solely on semantic relatedness without spelling biases.

### Vector Similarity Metrics

Understanding how to measure the similarity between vectors is crucial. The most renowned metric, cosine similarity, evaluates the cosine angle between vectors: the closer to 1.0, the more similar they are. However, models exhibit a naturally narrower range than the theoretical span from -1.0 to 1.0, emphasizing the importance of calibrating expectations according to each model's standard distribution.

In essence, vector embeddings enable nuanced machine understanding of complex inputs, making them indispensable in modern AI applications. Future developments will likely continue refining these models, improving alignment with human cognition, and optimizing their computational frameworks.

Here’s a concise summary of the discussion:

1. **Practical Implementation Insights**:  
   - User `mnmxr` highlights Python's role in creating embeddings, specifically using `requests` and OpenAI's client to interact with their embeddings API. They mention workflows involving `numpy` for similarity calculations, Jupyter notebooks for exploration, and Python's utility in data product development.  

2. **Visual Explanations Applauded**:  
   - User `sjstntm` praises visual approaches (e.g., charts, diagrams) for explaining complex concepts like embeddings, emphasizing clarity through "words, math, and heart."  

3. **Educational Resource Recommendation**:  
   - In a nested reply, `crtrmn` suggests Grant Sanderson’s [*Linear Algebra and LLMs* video series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjZofJX0v4M) as a complementary resource for understanding the mathematical foundations behind embeddings and language models.  

The discussion underscores Python’s practicality in embedding workflows and the value of visual or pedagogical tools for demystifying technical concepts.

### Two Paths for A.I

#### [Submission URL](https://www.newyorker.com/culture/open-questions/two-paths-for-ai) | 10 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44121378)

Hold onto your digital hats, because the debate over the future of AI has reached a fever pitch! Daniel Kokotajlo, an AI-safety researcher who bravely left his position at OpenAI, is sounding the alarm about our potentially menacing AI future. He believes the pace of AI intelligence is outstripping our ability to align these systems with human values, predicting that by 2027, AI could surpass humans in most tasks, leading to unimaginable consequences. Meanwhile, Princeton's Sayash Kapoor and Arvind Narayanan are waving the "calm down" flag with their book, "AI Snake Oil." They argue that the hype around AI's transformative potential is overblown, pointing out the many rookie errors current AI systems make, like bungling medical diagnoses.

Both sides are doubling down on their positions with new analyses. Kokotajlo's nonprofit has issued a chilling report, "AI 2027," warning of a possible future where superintelligent systems might dominate or even annihilate humanity by 2030. In contrast, Kapoor and Narayanan's paper, “AI as Normal Technology,” grounds us with the notion that practical barriers and safety measures will keep AI within manageable bounds, akin to nuclear power rather than nuclear weapons.

These experts offer profoundly divergent outlooks: one foresees apocalypse, the other anticipates business as usual. This sharp contrast in predictions evokes the parable of the blind men describing an elephant from different perspectives—AI's potential is vast and complex, leading to conflicting worldviews. West Coast, Silicon Valley enthusiasts embrace rapid change, while East Coast academics express cautious skepticism. The gap is widened by differing opinions on technology's impact on society, safety measures, and philosophical musings on what it means to "think."

As insiders and experts debate these high-stakes scenarios, the conversation becomes as entrancing as it is urgent. With timelines for AI's revolutionary potential ranging from 2027 to a safer 2045, the world waits with bated breath, watching to see which vision of the future unfolds. Will it be a world transformed or just more of the intriguing status quo? The jury is still out, and these intriguing discussions prove too fascinating to ignore.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges of ensuring AI systems align with human values and commands. User **invaderJ1m** raises a concern about achieving this alignment, using abbreviated phrasing (e.g., “nsr” for “ensure,” “hmn” for “human”). They suggest the ambiguity of terms like “ensure” complicates claims about AI acting in “accordance” with human values.  

User **trtlkr** responds critically, noting that “ensure” might rely on a secondary or less strict dictionary definition rather than absolute certainty. They argue that statements about AI alignment with human values are inherently subjective, as debates over definitions (e.g., what it means to “ensure” compliance) shape perceptions of safety and control.  

The exchange highlights tensions in AI ethics discussions: linguistic ambiguity, subjective interpretations of safety, and the difficulty of operationalizing abstract concepts like “human values” in AI development.

### Look Ma, No Bubbles: Designing a Low-Latency Megakernel for Llama-1B

#### [Submission URL](https://hazyresearch.stanford.edu/blog/2025-05-27-no-bubbles) | 226 points | by [ljosifov](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ljosifov) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44111673)

In the ever-evolving world of large language models (LLMs), speed is of the essence, particularly for applications that require low-latency responses like chatbots and human-in-the-loop workflows. A group of researchers, including Benjamin Spector and Jordan Juravsky, have devised a groundbreaking solution to accelerate LLMs on GPUs by designing a "megakernel" for the model Llama-1B. Traditionally, inference engines like vLLM and SGLang are hindered by the inefficiency of handling LLM processes in small, isolated kernels, each necessitating a costly setup and teardown that stall memory operations. These "memory pipeline bubbles" significantly limit performance, using only about 50% of the available GPU bandwidth.

In their ambitious project, the researchers merged the entire Llama-1B forward pass into one comprehensive megakernel, radically boosting efficiency to harness 78% of the GPU memory bandwidth. This innovation not only increases performance by 1.5x but also achieves the lowest latency forward pass for Llama-1B in bfloat16. Crucially, by eliminating kernel boundaries, they minimized overhead, synchronized operations efficiently, and kept the GPU consistently busy, thereby maximizing resource use.

Their open-source work provides a blueprint for achieving similar feats, enabling the future of lightning-fast, real-time LLM applications. The approach not only represents a significant advance for working with small-transformer settings where every microsecond counts but also lays the groundwork for further exploiting modern GPU capabilities. This cutting-edge engineering could redefine how we conceive processing speeds in AI, making split-second interactions a new norm.

The Hacker News discussion on the Llama-1B megakernel acceleration research highlights several key themes:

### Praise and Presentation Style  
- The work is widely praised for its technical ambition, with users calling it "groundbreaking" and "incredibly approachable." However, some note the research is presented as a blog post rather than a formal paper, leading to critiques about depth and reliance on buzzwords. A subthread debates whether this casual style aids accessibility or sacrifices rigor.

### Technical Scrutiny  
- **Performance Metrics**: Users request clearer benchmarks, especially comparisons with CUDA graphs and streams. The reported 1.5x speedup is acknowledged, but skeptics question scalability to larger models (e.g., 70B parameters) and real-world applicability.  
- **CUDA vs. Alternatives**: Discussions delve into CUDA’s limitations, such as synchronization overhead and kernel launch latency. Some express frustration with NVIDIA’s tooling, while others highlight the megakernel’s efficiency in reducing memory pipeline stalls.  
- **GPU Compatibility**: Questions arise about support for non-NVIDIA GPUs (e.g., Apple Silicon, Radeon), though the work appears CUDA-specific.  

### Practical Implications  
- **Memory Management**: Users speculate on OS-level optimizations for memory bandwidth and model loading, with anecdotes about Linux caching strategies and MacBook hardware constraints.  
- **Scalability**: While the megakernel excels for small models like Llama-1B, its impact on Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) or larger models remains debated. Some suggest the approach could benefit batched inference but may face diminishing returns.  

### Broader Trends  
- A meta-discussion critiques the AI research landscape, noting a trend toward flashy, buzzword-heavy publications over incremental but foundational work.  

Overall, the thread reflects enthusiasm for the technical leap but underscores the need for deeper benchmarks, scalability insights, and practical deployment considerations.

### AI: Accelerated Incompetence

#### [Submission URL](https://www.slater.dev/accelerated-incompetence/) | 298 points | by [stevekrouse](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stevekrouse) | [262 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44114631)

In an insightful essay from a seasoned software engineer, the potential pitfalls of over-reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) are thoroughly examined. As AI becomes more integral in the software development process, it's essential to recognize the limitations and inherent risks of using LLMs. The essay begins by addressing the notion that while LLMs might seem like a friend, helping speed up coding tasks, they present significant risks, such as producing incorrect output and failing to handle leading or flawed prompts effectively.

The discussion highlights several risks: **Output Risk**, where an LLM generates inaccurate code; **Input Risk**, where an LLM cannot intuitively question flawed problem assumptions; **Future Velocity**, where the rapid generation of suboptimal code leads to technical debt; and **User Infantilization**, where critical thinking and problem-solving skills atrophy due to over-dependence on AI. Additionally, this dependency can lead to a diminished sense of joy and satisfaction in coding for many developers.

The essay also explores the fear that engineers could become redundant, countering this with the argument that LLMs lack certain competencies, such as gaining a deep understanding of **program theory** and managing **program entropy**. Quoting Peter Naur, the essay emphasizes that the true value of software lies not in the code itself but in the shared understanding and theory behind it. In a thought experiment, it illustrates how teams with a solid mental model of a program are better prepared to enhance it than those who only have access to the code.

LLMs are limited in their ability to navigate these complexities because they lack the capacity to internalize and recall program theories beyond their immediate context, which humans excel at. As the essay concludes, while LLMs can facilitate certain tasks, they cannot replace the nuanced understanding and creativity that comes from human experience in software engineering.

For developers and engineers eager to delve deeper into strategies for mitigating these AI-related risks, the author promises future insights, prompting readers to stay tuned for upcoming reflections on maintaining the craft and joy of coding amidst the rise of AI.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores the tension between traditional software engineering (SWE) practices and the probabilistic nature of machine learning (ML/AI), highlighting concerns about over-reliance on AI tools like LLMs. Key themes include:

1. **SWE vs. MLE Mindsets**:  
   - SWEs focus on deterministic systems with clear requirements and reproducibility, while ML engineers (MLEs) work with stochastic models and probabilistic outcomes. Overusing AI coding assistants risks introducing errors, as MLEs’ probabilistic thinking clashes with deterministic expectations.  
   - Example: Classical approaches (e.g., motion prediction, control pipelines) often outperform ML solutions in reliability, as seen in Amazon projects where ML led to erratic behavior (e.g., flickering, unstable outputs).

2. **Engineering Fundamentals**:  
   - Many software practitioners lack foundational engineering principles, particularly those from non-traditional backgrounds (e.g., bootcamps vs. hard sciences). This gap hinders effective problem-solving and integration of classical methods.  
   - High-quality data and problem understanding are critical for ML success, but often overlooked, leading to suboptimal or "unsolvable" solutions.

3. **AI Limitations and Risks**:  
   - **Accuracy vs. Real-World Impact**: High accuracy metrics (e.g., 90%) may not translate to practical utility. Examples include AI models failing in predictive maintenance compared to simpler statistical methods.  
   - **Technical Debt**: Rapid AI-generated code risks entropy accumulation, complicating maintenance and system understanding.  
   - **Misplaced Trust**: Assuming AI correctness can lead to critical failures, akin to Tesla’s Autopilot misuse where users over-relied on imperfect systems.

4. **Skepticism of Hype**:  
   - Current AI offerings are viewed with skepticism, with critics arguing that "90% correct" outputs mask fundamental flaws. Some compare AI hype to historical engineering over-optimism, urging caution against belief-driven narratives.  
   - Others counter that AI’s value lies in its utility despite imperfections, emphasizing context-aware integration.

5. **Cultural and Organizational Challenges**:  
   - Disconnects between ML teams and product teams arise when metrics (e.g., F1 scores) don’t align with business needs. Pressure to deploy AI for "innovation" often overlooks practicality.  
   - MLEs face expectations to mimic SWE practices, yet their work inherently involves uncertainty, requiring hybrid skills (e.g., SWE principles + ML expertise).

**Notable Takeaways**:  
- **Balance is Key**: While AI tools like LLMs offer efficiency, they must complement—not replace—human judgment and classical engineering.  
- **Context Matters**: Successful ML integration requires understanding system constraints, data quality, and problem fundamentals.  
- **The Human Element**: Critical thinking, domain expertise, and maintaining "program theory" remain irreplaceable in managing complexity and entropy.  

The discussion underscores a call for humility: leveraging AI’s strengths while respecting its limitations and preserving engineering rigor.

### Running GPT-2 in WebGL: Rediscovering the Lost Art of GPU Shader Programming

#### [Submission URL](https://nathan.rs/posts/gpu-shader-programming/) | 140 points | by [nathan-barry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nathan-barry) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44109257)

A few weeks ago, Pascal's project of running GPT-2 using WebGL and shaders on Hacker News sparked considerable interest and discussion among tech enthusiasts. This innovative experiment highlighted a blend of art and technology, invoking the early excitement of programmable shaders from the 2000s. Back then, NVIDIA introduced programmable shaders capable of performing complex visual effects, and soon developers realized these could be harnessed for general-purpose computations, albeit clumsily through graphics APIs like OpenGL's GLSL.

The journey from the convoluted shader languages for computing to a streamlined approach began with NVIDIA's release of CUDA in 2006. This parallel computing platform allowed developers to use C/C++ to engage GPU power without needing to juggle the complexities of a graphics API. CUDA, followed by OpenCL, heralded the era of general-purpose GPU programming, transforming GPUs into multi-core processors ideal for vast parallel computations.

Compared to graphics-specific APIs that involve a fixed pipeline emphasizing images, computing APIs like CUDA and OpenCL allowed developers to leverage GPUs directly for non-graphical computations. Gone were the days of shoehorning data into texture forms and utilizing off-screen framebuffers; now, developers could simply manage raw data with minimal overhead.

In his experiment, Pascal impressively repurposed graphics concepts—hijacking textures, and framebuffers, along with vertex and fragment shaders to run GPT-2 on a GPU. By treating textures as tensors and cleverly redirecting rendering outputs, he simulated a high-throughput data bus. This approach allowed him to store and process numerical data in a shader-based compute engine without a traditional graphics focus. Textures and Framebuffer Objects (FBOs) were adapted to serve as containers for matrix and vector data, swapped efficiently through ping-pong rendering without needing to revert to the CPU, thus optimizing performance.

Pascal's implementation is a fascinating testament to GPU programming's evolution, showcasing how vintage techniques can innovate today's machine learning workflows on consumer hardware. For those eager to dive deeper, exploring his work offers not just nostalgia, but a fresh perspective on the untapped potential of GPUs in the modern computing landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Pascal's WebGL-based GPT-2 implementation highlights technical nuances, historical context, and debates about modern GPU programming:

1. **Technical Implementation Insights**:
   - Participants dissected optimizations like using `glDrawArrays` with triangles to minimize fragment shader overhead and leveraging vertex shaders for UV coordinate generation. Techniques such as "ping-pong rendering" with FBOs (Framebuffer Objects) were noted for efficient GPU data management without CPU intervention.

2. **Historical Context**:
   - The project evoked nostalgia for early GPGPU (General-Purpose GPU) efforts, where developers repurposed graphics APIs like OpenGL for non-graphical computations before CUDA/OpenCL. Comparisons were drawn to pre-2012 machine learning workflows, such as AlexNet’s reliance on GPUs, which validated GPU training years before CUDA’s dominance.

3. **Critiques of Terminology and Accuracy**:
   - Some argued the original article mischaracterized traditional graphics APIs (e.g., OpenGL) as rigidly fixed-function, overlooking their flexibility. Debates arose over terms like "hijacking" shaders, with clarifications that fragment shaders effectively act as parallel threads, akin to CUDA kernels.

4. **WebGL vs. WebGPU**:
   - While WebGL2 lacks true compute shaders, forcing creative workarounds, participants highlighted WebGPU as the future standard for GPU computing on the web. Chrome’s slow adoption of WebGL compute shaders was criticized, with WebGPU seen as a more robust, vendor-neutral solution already supported by ~66% of browsers (per web3dsurvey data).

5. **Project Challenges**:
   - The author shared practical hurdles, such as loading model weights in browsers and adapting transformer computations to WebGL’s constraints. The GitHub repo demonstrates attention visualization and matrix operations within WebGL’s limits.

**Key Takeaway**: The project is praised as a clever, educational hack that bridges vintage GPU techniques with modern ML, while the discussion underscores the evolving landscape of web-based GPU computing and the community’s anticipation for WebGPU’s broader adoption.

### Just make it scale: An Aurora DSQL story

#### [Submission URL](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2025/05/just-make-it-scale-an-aurora-dsql-story.html) | 128 points | by [cebert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cebert) | [39 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44105878)

While back at the 2025 re:Invent, the announcement of Aurora DSQL was an exciting moment, it was the journey and the intricate engineering decisions behind it that truly captivated the minds of industry builders. Recently, at DevCon, two senior principal engineers, Niko Matsakis and Marc Bowes, shed light on how they transitioned DSQL from being rooted in JVM to embracing Rust. With their insight, a rich exploration of the development process was born, intertwining the technical complexities and philosophical evolutions at play. 

Aurora DSQL’s story is more than just a technological upgrade; it's a testament to prioritizing engineering efficiency and a culture of questioning past successes. The authors of this inspiring narrative, alongside numerous principal engineers, highlight the importance of expertise spanning from storage to control plane engineering.

AWS's database journey since the launch of Amazon RDS in 2009 has been marked by a strategic evolution. It met increasing customer demands for variety and immediacy with purpose-built databases like DynamoDB, Redshift, and Aurora. These solutions didn't arrive overnight; they were products of iterative listening, customer collaborations, and a willingness to challenge prior assumptions. Each development tackled real production constraints, exampled by ElastiCache's inception to double output for relational databases and Neptune's emergence as graph-heavy applications grew.

The persistent challenge of creating a relational database requiring zero infrastructure management while scaling automatically remained. Aurora's past innovations like cloud-optimized storage and Aurora Serverless hinted at this future but didn’t complete it. DSQL does, by deconstructing the database into modular components with the clarity and simplicity of Unix philosophy—each doing one specific task well, together translating into the full suite of expected database features.

The tale of scaling DSQL's Journal layer from traditional approaches underscores the ingenuity involved. Instead of the typical two-phase commit (2PC) which can spiral into operational complexities, DSQL chose to write entire commits into a single journal, simplifying write path scalability while complicating reads. This radical approach required new solutions to maintain availability, latency, and operational simplicity, demonstrating once more the necessity to rethink foundational principles for innovative progress.

Aurora DSQL's development journey exemplifies the AWS ethos: a forward-looking blend of innovation rooted in customer-centric, iterative advances and disciplined engineering rigor, pushing the boundaries of what a cloud database can be.

**Summary of Discussion:**

- **Performance Gains with Rust:** The transition from JVM languages (Kotlin/Java) to Rust for Aurora DSQL led to a 10x performance boost (30k vs. 3k TPS), attributed to reduced memory footprint, I/O overhead elimination, and avoiding garbage collection. Users debated whether such rewrites are worth the effort for greenfield projects but acknowledged PostgreSQL's extensibility as a key enabler.

- **Pricing Models & Cost Certainty:** Discussions contrasted DSQL's "serverless" pricing with DynamoDB's on-demand/provisioned models. Skepticism arose around cost predictability, with some noting that true "absolute cost certainty" remains challenging depending on workload patterns.

- **Current DSQL Limitations:** Early adopters highlighted restrictions like transaction limits (e.g., 3k modified rows per transaction), missing features (views, foreign keys, JSONB, TRUNCATE), and limited PostgreSQL extension support (e.g., pg_vector). AWS engineers (e.g., mjb) clarified these are temporary, with updates actively rolling out (AWS Backup, CloudFormation, read-only views).

- **LLMs & Code Transformation:** Speculation emerged about AI/LLMs automating high-to-low-level code translation (e.g., JVM to Rust) to reduce migration costs. Skeptics pointed to technical gaps (e.g., GC vs. non-GC paradigms, OOP-to-systems language translation), though some expressed optimism for future tooling.

- **Technical Debates:** Rust's advantages (memory safety, no GC, reduced fragmentation) were contrasted with JVM tradeoffs. Users emphasized that avoiding GC in Rust directly enabled latency/throughput improvements critical for distributed systems like DSQL.

- **Architecture Insights:** Links to Marc Brooker’s blog posts were shared, detailing DSQL’s design (distributed writes, modularity, and scalability). The system’s alignment with Unix principles (simple, composable components) was praised as a core innovation.
