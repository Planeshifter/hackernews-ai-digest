### PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742) | 113 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37285396)

The paper titled "PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer" by Xiaopeng Li and his co-authors proposes a new method for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). Model editing techniques modify a small portion of knowledge in LLMs at a low cost, and this paper aims to improve the precision of these edits.

Previous methods assumed that the hidden states of the Transformer Layer (TL) in LLMs are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These methods optimized the TL hidden states to remember target knowledge and used it to update the weights of the FFN. However, the TL hidden states contain information that is not specifically required for the FFN, and neglecting this fact reduces the performance of model editing.

To address this, the authors analyze the hidden states of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and FFN, and discover that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This finding suggests that the MHSA weights do not need to be updated when new knowledge is introduced. Based on this insight, the authors introduce PMET, which optimizes the hidden states of the Transformer Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN), while only using the optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights.

The experiments conducted demonstrate that PMET achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the enhancements introduced in PMET, emphasizing the finding that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and stores a small amount of factual knowledge.

Overall, the proposed PMET algorithm improves the precision of model editing in LLMs, offering potential advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

### Interpretable graph neural networks for tabular data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models.

### Show HN: PlotAI â€“ Create Plots in Python and Matplotlib with LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mljar/plotai) | 50 points | by [pplonski86](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pplonski86) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37260913)

PlotAI is a new Python library that makes it incredibly easy to create plots in Python using Matplotlib. The library harnesses the power of the LLM (Language Models for Plots) to generate the necessary Python code for creating plots based on user input. Here's how it works: users provide a DataFrame and a prompt, and PlotAI constructs a prompt for the LLM that includes the first five rows of the DataFrame and the user's prompt. The LLM then generates Python code as output, which is executed and the resulting plot is displayed. The PlotAI API is incredibly simple, with just one method called `make()`. Users can use this method in Python scripts and notebooks (such as Jupyter, Colab, and VS Code) to create plots. To get started with PlotAI, users need to install the PlotAI package (`pip install plotai`) and provide their OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. Once that's done, they can import PlotAI and start making plots using just a single line of code. While PlotAI is currently in an experimental form, there are plans to extend its compatibility to other LLM models in the future. However, it's important to note that PlotAI sends the first five rows of the DataFrame to the OpenAI ChatGPT model, so users should remove or encode any sensitive data before using it. Additionally, since PlotAI executes the Python code returned by the LLM, caution should be exercised, and it would be beneficial to have the option to review the response code before execution. The developers of PlotAI provide it "as is," without any warranty, and users are responsible for any risks associated with its use. It's also important to note that the use of OpenAI language models can be costly due to token usage, so users should monitor and manage their own token usage to avoid unexpected charges. Overall, PlotAI aims to make plot generation in Python more accessible and intuitive for users. With its simplicity and integration with LLM technology, creating visualizations has never been easier.

The discussion around the PlotAI submission on Hacker News covers a few different points:

1. A user suggests exploring Vega and Vega-Lite for visualization grammar and mentions the use of Vegavoyager and CompassQL for chart recommendations.
2. Another user mentions the potential benefits of using OpenAI's language models to generate synthetic data for graphing but raises concerns about the formatting and potential misuse.
3. A user comments on the potential usefulness of LLMs like the ones used by PlotAI and suggests the Code Llama tool as an alternative with the ability to generate appropriate chart types based on natural language metadata.
4. One user appreciates the simplicity of PlotAI's API and suggests an example of how to use it in Python scripts and notebooks.
5. There is a discussion about the capabilities of the LLM model in understanding and generating prompt-specific Python code and surprise at its ability to generalize from the first five rows of a DataFrame.
6. Another conversation arises about a potential major acquisition and ML projects, with one user seeking advice on the topic.
7. Lastly, there is a short exchange regarding string arguments and comments in code.
