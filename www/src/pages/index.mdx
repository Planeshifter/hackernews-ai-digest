### PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742) | 113 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37285396)

The paper titled "PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer" by Xiaopeng Li and his co-authors proposes a new method for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). Model editing techniques modify a small portion of knowledge in LLMs at a low cost, and this paper aims to improve the precision of these edits.

Previous methods assumed that the hidden states of the Transformer Layer (TL) in LLMs are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These methods optimized the TL hidden states to remember target knowledge and used it to update the weights of the FFN. However, the TL hidden states contain information that is not specifically required for the FFN, and neglecting this fact reduces the performance of model editing.

To address this, the authors analyze the hidden states of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and FFN, and discover that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This finding suggests that the MHSA weights do not need to be updated when new knowledge is introduced. Based on this insight, the authors introduce PMET, which optimizes the hidden states of the Transformer Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN), while only using the optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights.

The experiments conducted demonstrate that PMET achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the enhancements introduced in PMET, emphasizing the finding that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and stores a small amount of factual knowledge.

Overall, the proposed PMET algorithm improves the precision of model editing in LLMs, offering potential advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

### Interpretable graph neural networks for tabular data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models.

### Show HN: PlotAI – Create Plots in Python and Matplotlib with LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mljar/plotai) | 50 points | by [pplonski86](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pplonski86) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37260913)

PlotAI is a new Python library that makes it incredibly easy to create plots in Python using Matplotlib. The library harnesses the power of the LLM (Language Models for Plots) to generate the necessary Python code for creating plots based on user input. Here's how it works: users provide a DataFrame and a prompt, and PlotAI constructs a prompt for the LLM that includes the first five rows of the DataFrame and the user's prompt. The LLM then generates Python code as output, which is executed and the resulting plot is displayed. The PlotAI API is incredibly simple, with just one method called `make()`. Users can use this method in Python scripts and notebooks (such as Jupyter, Colab, and VS Code) to create plots. To get started with PlotAI, users need to install the PlotAI package (`pip install plotai`) and provide their OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. Once that's done, they can import PlotAI and start making plots using just a single line of code. While PlotAI is currently in an experimental form, there are plans to extend its compatibility to other LLM models in the future. However, it's important to note that PlotAI sends the first five rows of the DataFrame to the OpenAI ChatGPT model, so users should remove or encode any sensitive data before using it. Additionally, since PlotAI executes the Python code returned by the LLM, caution should be exercised, and it would be beneficial to have the option to review the response code before execution. The developers of PlotAI provide it "as is," without any warranty, and users are responsible for any risks associated with its use. It's also important to note that the use of OpenAI language models can be costly due to token usage, so users should monitor and manage their own token usage to avoid unexpected charges. Overall, PlotAI aims to make plot generation in Python more accessible and intuitive for users. With its simplicity and integration with LLM technology, creating visualizations has never been easier.

The discussion around the PlotAI submission on Hacker News covers a few different points:

1. A user suggests exploring Vega and Vega-Lite for visualization grammar and mentions the use of Vegavoyager and CompassQL for chart recommendations.

### ChatGPT turned generative AI into an “anything tool”

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2023/08/how-chatgpt-turned-generative-ai-into-an-anything-tool/) | 197 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [206 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37236027)

The chief technology officer of a robotics startup recently discovered that they could use a pre-trained AI model, ChatGPT, to control their robots without the need for specialized training. This highlights a shift towards general-purpose AI models that can be used across various applications, rather than being limited to specific domains. The key to this development is making large language models (LLMs) more responsive to human interaction. For example, OpenAI's work on ChatGPT involved modifying LLMs like GPT3 to improve their conversational capabilities. As a result, newer versions like GPT3.5 and GPT4 can be utilized as powerful, general-purpose information-processing tools that don't rely on the original training data or applications.

### The False Promises of Tesla’s Full Self Driving

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23837598/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-false-promises-land-of-the-giants) | 32 points | by [ra7](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ra7) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37242435)

In the latest episode of Land of the Giants: The Tesla Shock Wave, The Verge explores the false promises of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature. Back in 2016, Elon Musk announced that all Tesla vehicles would come equipped with the hardware necessary for full self-driving capabilities. However, the reality is that Tesla has yet to deliver on that promise. While they have released an advanced driver-assist system called FSD beta, the idea of a Tesla owner being able to nap in their car while it drives itself is far from becoming a reality. In fact, there have been hundreds of crashes involving Tesla vehicles using FSD and Autopilot, as well as multiple deaths. Government agencies are investigating Tesla's claims around self-driving, and a major recall could be on the horizon. The episode features firsthand testing of FSD and other autonomous vehicles, interviews with experts and former Tesla employees, and insights from competitors like General Motors-backed Cruise. The Verge's investigation raises questions about whether Tesla will be able to fulfill its promises without rethinking its hardware strategy.

The discussion revolves around the skepticism surrounding Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature and the safety concerns associated with it. One commenter highlights that many people, including technical experts, wrongly believe that Tesla is leading the self-driving industry when in reality, they have not delivered on their promises. Another commenter points out that Waymo and Cruise have significantly more miles logged with fewer incidents compared to Tesla. They argue that Tesla's FSD system requires constant monitoring and is not as advanced as Waymo and Cruise. However, another commenter disagrees and mentions that many people enjoy using FSD and understand its limitations. The discussion also covers the issue of Tesla's safety reports, with one commenter asserting that they consist of unverified crash rates and misleading statistics. They suggest that Tesla's marketing department manipulates the data to present an incomplete safety profile. In contrast, Waymo's reports are said to provide detailed analysis of crash differences. Another commenter brings up multiple instances of Tesla's safety defects, such as failing to recognize road signs and critical deficiencies in its Driver Monitoring System. They argue that these issues persist despite several months of demonstrations and highlight the importance of addressing safety concerns in a self-driving product. One commenter expresses appreciation for the Dawn Project's comprehensive coverage, pointing out that their videos showcase the discrepancies between Tesla's claims and the reality of the FSD system.
