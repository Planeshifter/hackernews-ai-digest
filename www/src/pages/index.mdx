Solar Designer disclosed a new issue, CVE-2024-6409, related to OpenSSH, which could lead to remote code execution in the privsep child due to a race condition in signal handling. This vulnerability affects OpenSSH versions 8.7 and 8.8, particularly on glibc-based Linux systems like RHEL 9 and certain Fedora versions. Though the immediate impact is lower as it affects the privsep child process with reduced privileges, there could be scenarios where it might be exploited more effectively than the previously disclosed CVE-2024-6387. Solar Designer apologized for the delay in disclosing CVE-2024-6409 and explained the coordination with Red Hat for the separate release date. The discussion includes insights into the bug report and the patch addressing the issue, emphasizing the potential risks and mitigations for both vulnerabilities.

### Show HN: Parallel DOM – Upgrade your DOM to be multithreaded

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pdom.dev/) | 72 points | by [ashubham](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ashubham) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40920812)

The top story on Hacker News today is about Parallel DOM, a new tool that allows developers to speed up their web applications by parallelizing heavy DOM operations. This tool offers a simple and intuitive API, making it easy to use with existing code. It ensures security by executing code within a sandboxed iframe wrapper and dedicating a CPU process for JavaScript and DOM manipulation.

One of the unique features of Parallel DOM is the ability to run React components in a parallel DOM environment, allowing developers to pass props and callbacks as usual. The tool can be self-hosted to avoid using the provided domain. Developers can deploy Parallel DOM using Vercel or their own infrastructure by following a few simple steps.

In the FAQ section, the creators address common concerns such as the security of iframes, the limitations of web workers for DOM manipulation, and the browser support for Parallel DOM. They emphasize that Parallel DOM is open source, giving developers the option to host it themselves if they prefer.

Overall, Parallel DOM seems to be a promising tool for improving the performance of web applications through parallelization of DOM operations.

The discussion about the top Hacker News story about Parallel DOM includes comments on various aspects of the tool and its compatibility with different browsers. Some users provided insights into the comparisons between Chrome and Firefox, mentioning differences in performance and synchronization issues.

### Apple blog TUAW returns as an AI content farm

#### [Submission URL](https://www.engadget.com/apple-blog-tuaw-returns-as-an-ai-content-farm-225326136.html) | 17 points | by [MBCook](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MBCook) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40922209)

The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) is back online after nearly a decade, but something seems off. AI-generated content bearing old writers' bylines has raised eyebrows. Christina Warren flagged the suspicious tactic, calling out an SEO ploy using her name from a decade ago. TUAW was shut down in 2015, and its domain was sold to "Web Orange Limited" in 2024. The new owners claimed to revitalize TUAW's legacy by rehashing old content but faced criticism for inaccurate author attributions. After scrutiny, TUAW changed some author names to generic ones but stayed mum on AI use. Yahoo, which owns Engadget, the original TUAW archive, remained silent too.

The discussion revolves around the controversial re-launch of The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) and the suspicions surrounding AI-generated content bearing old writers' bylines. 

- al_borland finds it interesting that TUAW's content seems missing or materialized strangely, expressing concern over the source's credibility and the shutdown that occurred years ago.
- MBCook believes that the submitted article may be a joke, pointing out that some papers reportedly had their names swapped, and questioning the validity of the writers' posts being rewritten by AI. They mention Christina Warren's involvement.
- flmgrlcw mentions that Christina Warren appears to have noticed various discrepancies in the archive of TUAW, such as headlines being altered and random writer names assigned. They criticize the AI rewriting, assuming the tactic was used for profit by manipulating search engines, although they acknowledge the tricky legal enforcement involved in changing bylines. The commenter appreciates other tech publications like iLounge quickly reacting to similar issues in the past. They express gratitude for the media outlets that handled the situation with transparency and mention Yahoo's ownership.
- RecycledEle wishes for accurate reports on web content monitoring to address issues of recycled and ranked search engine results.
