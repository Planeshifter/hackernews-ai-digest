### Cowork: Claude Code for the rest of your work

#### [Submission URL](https://claude.com/blog/cowork-research-preview) | 1160 points | by [adocomplete](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adocomplete) | [501 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46593022)

Anthropic announces Cowork: Claude Code’s autonomy for everyday work (research preview)

- What it is: Cowork is a new mode in the Claude macOS app that lets the model read, edit, and create files inside a folder you choose—bringing Claude Code’s “agentic” workflow to non‑coding tasks.
- How it works: You grant folder access, set a task, and Claude plans and executes with status updates. It can reorganize downloads, turn receipt screenshots into a spreadsheet, or draft a report from scattered notes. You can queue tasks (runs in parallel), avoid constant context wrangling, and keep working while it proceeds.
- Extensibility: Works with your existing connectors and a first set of “skills” for producing docs, decks, and other files. Paired with Claude in Chrome, it can handle tasks requiring the browser.
- Safety model: You control which folders/connectors it can see; Claude asks before significant actions. Still, it can perform destructive operations (e.g., delete files) if instructed. Anthropic flags prompt‑injection risks and recommends clear instructions and caution; more guidance is in their Help Center.
- Availability: Research preview for Claude Max subscribers on macOS today. Windows and cross‑device sync are planned; waitlist available for other plans.
- Why it matters: Shifts Claude from chat into a practical desktop coworker, reducing copy/paste friction and enabling end‑to‑end task completion for non‑dev workflows.

**Discussion Summary:**

Technical discussion focused heavily on the security implications of granting an LLM agent autonomy over local files, specifically regarding prompt injection, data exfiltration, and privacy.

*   **Prompt Injection Risks:** Users expressed skepticism regarding the safety model, specifically the risk of **indirect prompt injection** (where the model reads a file containing malicious hidden instructions). One commenter noted that Anthropic’s support page puts the burden on the user to "avoid granting access to sensitive information" and "monitor for suspicious actions," which they argued is an unsafe expectation for non-technical users.
*   **Sandbox & Exfiltration Vectors:** There was a deep dive into the underlying architecture; testing by `smnw` revealed the environment operates as a **full Linux (Ubuntu) container** running via Apple’s Virtualization framework. While the sandbox has a default allow-list for domains, users demonstrated that data could still be exfiltrated via **DNS tunneling** (e.g., using `dig` to send data to a malicious server).
*   **Privacy Implications:** Participants clarified that, according to Anthropic's Terms of Service, files within mounted folders are treated as "Inputs." This means granting the agent access to a folder effectively sends that data to Anthropic, raising concerns about using the tool with proprietary or sensitive documents.
*   **Agent Control & Safety:** Anecdotes highlighted the difficulty of constraining the agent's behavior. One user reported that despite instructions to focus on a specific subdirectory, the agent attempted to access parent directories. Others suggested the tool needs built-in "rollback" capabilities (like ZFS snapshots or git integration) to mitigate accidental destructive actions.

### TimeCapsuleLLM: LLM trained only on data from 1800-1875

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/haykgrigo3/TimeCapsuleLLM) | 695 points | by [admp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=admp) | [287 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46590280)

TimeCapsule LLM: training models on era-bounded corpora to cut modern bias

- What it is: An open-source experiment to train language models exclusively on texts from specific places and time periods (e.g., London, 1800–1875) so the model adopts the era’s voice, vocabulary, and worldview—rather than role‑playing a historical persona.
- How it’s built: Early versions use nanoGPT; v1 switches to Microsoft’s Phi-1.5; v2 uses llama-for-causal-lm. The repo includes data pipelines pulling from Internet Archive, plus a London corpus. MIT licensed.
- Why it’s interesting: “Time-bounded” training offers a way to reduce modern framing and bias when generating historical prose or analysis, producing outputs that feel native to the period.
- Results so far:
  - v0 (≈187MB data): convincingly archaic tone but largely incoherent.
  - v0.5: big jump in grammar and Victorian style, still hallucinates; OCR artifacts leak into outputs (“Digitized by Google”).
  - v1: first signs of grounded recall—ties “year of our Lord 1834” to London protests.
  - v2 mini-evals (15GB sample, 10k steps): tokenization glitch introduces spaced-out syllables; corrected text shows period flavor but remains meandering.
- Trade-offs: Authentic style vs. factual reliability; small and noisy historical datasets make grounding hard. Tokenization and OCR cleanup are clear next steps.
- Status: 1.5k stars, 44 forks. Multilingual README. Includes scripts, dataset IDs, and sample outputs/images.
- Potential uses: Period-accurate writing, education, historical simulation—anywhere modern phrasing and assumptions get in the way of “speaking from the past.”

**Scientific Discovery and the "Einstein Test"**
The most active thread debates a thought experiment proposed by users: if a model trained exclusively on pre-1900 data can derive Special Relativity or Quantum Mechanics when prompted, does this constitute proof of AGI?
*   **The Synthesis Argument:** Some argue that late 19th-century physics already contained the necessary components (Michelson-Morley experiments, Lorentz transformations, etc.). If an LLM creates Relativity from this, it may simply prove that the theory was an inevitable synthesis of existing data rather than a "quantum leap" of reasoning.
*   **Defining Genius:** This sparked a philosophical debate regarding the nature of scientific progress. Users discussed whether figures like Einstein produced unique structural insights or merely completed a puzzle that was already 99% solved by the scientific *Zeitgeist*.
*   **Paradigm Shifts:** Commenters referenced Thomas Kuhn, questioning if an LLM can bridge "incommensurate paradigms" (e.g., jumping from Newtonian gravity to composition-based spectral analysis) without the empirical evidence that usually drives such shifts.
*   **Research Utility:** Beyond AGI benchmarks, users seeing value in using era-bounded LLMs as "Mycrofts" (armchair detectives)—tools that can read vast historical corpora faster than humans to identify missed connections or viable hypotheses that were overlooked at the time.

### Show HN: AI in SolidWorks

#### [Submission URL](https://www.trylad.com) | 180 points | by [WillNickols](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=WillNickols) | [98 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46591100)

LAD (Language-Aided Designer) is a new SolidWorks add-in that lets you drive CAD with natural language. Describe what you want in plain English and it translates that into sketches, features, and even assemblies—checking the model’s screenshots and feature tree to verify steps and auto-correct mistakes.

Notable features
- Design from docs and images: Feed it specification PDFs, reference images, or previous parts/assemblies and it will read and use them.
- Macro support: Can write and run VBA macros, looking up SolidWorks API docs/examples to tailor code for niche tasks and reproducibility.
- Guardrails: Per-command permissioning, rule-based guidance, and checkpointed versioning so you can revert unwanted changes.
- Context awareness: Natively tracks model state and compresses long conversations to stay on task.

What’s new (v1.1, 2026-01-11)
- Planning mode
- Macro writing/running
- Sketch issue detection/reporting
- Faster caching and AI context improvements
- Bug fixes

Other notes
- Integrates directly in SolidWorks; Windows download available.
- Referral program: “Refer a friend” for free months of LAD Pro for both parties.
- The site lists common questions (pricing, data collection, compatibility) but doesn’t answer them on the page.

**LAD (Language-Aided Designer) for SolidWorks**
LAD is a newly updated SolidWorks add-in (v1.1) that enables engineers to drive CAD design using natural language. The tool translates plain English instructions, specification PDFs, and reference images into native SolidWorks sketches, features, and assemblies. Key capabilities include the ability to write and run VBA macros via API lookups, a "planning mode" for complex tasks, and robust guardrails that allow users to preview and revert AI-generated changes. The system checks model screenshots and feature trees to verify steps and auto-correct errors. Windows-based and integrated directly into SolidWorks, LAD aims to bridge the gap between documentation and 3D modeling.

**Discussion Summary**
The Hacker News discussion revolves around the steep learning curve of SolidWorks, the viability of AI in precision engineering, and the broader landscape of CAD software.

*   **SolidWorks Usability vs. Power:** A significant portion of the debate focuses on the SolidWorks user experience. Some users describe the software as non-intuitive and frustrating for beginners, citing broken tutorials, "hidden" features, and a UI built on decades of conventions that feel archaic. Conversely, veteran users argue that while the learning curve is steep (taking months or years), SolidWorks is arguably the most flexible and efficient tool once mastered. They note that the UI stability allows professionals to maintain muscle memory over decades.
*   **The "Amalgamation" Problem:** Commenters noted that SolidWorks feels like an amalgamation of various regional software and plugins acquired over time, leading to inconsistent interfaces. This was contrasted with newer, cloud-native alternatives like Onshape (praised for collaboration and Linux support) and Fusion 360 (praised for approachability, though criticized for vendor lock-in and pricing strategies).
*   **AI Reliability in CAD:** There is skepticism regarding AI-driven modeling. One user expressed fear that an AI might misinterpret a prompt and create subtle model errors that take longer to debug than simply building the part from scratch. The LAD creator (*WillNickols*) clarifies that the tool captures model snapshots before every action, allowing users to instantly revert mistakes.
*   **Related Projects:** The thread spawned discussions on similar AI hardware efforts. One user (*mkyls*) detailed an ambitious project attempting to automate the entire product development pipeline (PCB, enclosure, firmware) using AI, while another (*pnys*) mentioned "GrandpaCAD," a text-to-CAD tool originally designed to help seniors build simple models.
*   **Stagnation vs. Stability:** Users observed that the core SolidWorks interface hasn't changed much in 15 years. While some see this as a lack of innovation compared to web-based tools, others argue that for mission-critical industrial software (like Catia and Matlab), UI stability is a feature, not a bug. However, the recent push toward the "3DEXPERIENCE" cloud platform was universally criticized as intrusive.

### Show HN: Yolobox – Run AI coding agents with full sudo without nuking home dir

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/finbarr/yolobox) | 110 points | by [Finbarr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Finbarr) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46592344)

Yolobox: let AI coding agents go “full send” without nuking your home directory

What it is:
- A Go-based wrapper that runs AI coding agents inside a Docker/Podman container where your project is mounted at /workspace, but your host $HOME isn’t mounted by default.
- Ships a batteries-included image with Claude Code, Gemini CLI, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, Node 22, Python 3, build tools, git/gh, and common CLI utilities.

Why it matters:
- Full‑auto AI agents are powerful but risky; one bad command can trash your machine. Yolobox gives them sudo inside a sandbox while keeping your actual home directory off-limits, so you can let them refactor, install, and run without constant approvals.

Notable features:
- YOLO mode aliases: claude → claude --dangerously-skip-permissions, codex → codex --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox, gemini → gemini --yolo.
- Persistent volumes so tools/configs survive across sessions; extra mounts and env vars via flags or config files.
- Safety toggles: --no-network, --readonly-project (writes to /output), optional SSH agent forwarding, one-time --claude-config sync.
- Auto-forwards common API keys (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter) and GitHub tokens if present.
- Runs on macOS (Docker Desktop/OrbStack/Colima) and Linux (Docker/Podman). Note: Claude Code needs 4GB+ Docker RAM; bump Colima from its 2GB default.

Security model (read the fine print):
- Protects against accidental rm -rf ~ and host credential grabs by not mounting $HOME.
- It’s still a container: not protection against kernel/container escape exploits or a truly adversarial agent. For stronger isolation, use a VM.

Quick start:
- Install: curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/finbarr/yolobox/master/install.sh | bash
- In your repo: yolobox (interactive shell) or yolobox run claude

Config:
- ~/.config/yolobox/config.toml for globals; .yolobox.toml per project. Precedence: CLI flags > project config > global config.

Repo: github.com/finbarr/yolobox (MIT)

**Yolobox: let AI coding agents go “full send” without nuking your home directory**

**Top HN Story**
Yolobox is a Go-based wrapper designed to run autonomous AI coding agents—like Claude Code, Gemini, and OpenAI Codex—inside ephemeral Docker or Podman containers. The tool addresses the risks associated with giving AI agents "full auto" permission by mounting the current project directory into the container while keeping the host’s `$HOME` directory and sensitive credentials inaccessible.

It acts as a "batteries-included" sandbox, pre-installed with Node, Python, and common build tools. It offers "YOLO mode" aliases (e.g., `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions`) and manages persistent volumes so distinct sessions retain context. While it prevents accidental file deletion or credential scraping on the host, the author notes that as a container-based solution, it does not offer the same isolation level as a VM against kernel exploits or determined adversarial attacks.

**Discussion Summary**
The discussion focused on security boundaries, alternative implementations, and the philosophical "laws" of AI behavior in development environments.

*   **Alternative Approaches & Comparisons:** Several users shared similar tools. **Gerharddc** highlighted [Litterbox](https://github.com/Gerharddc/litterbox), which leans on Podman and includes Wayland socket exposure for GUI apps and SSH agent prompts. **LayeredDelay** and **jcqsnd** discussed [shai](https://github.com/clany-2/shai), a local tool that defaults to read-only access and strictly controls network traffic, contrasting with Yolobox’s read-write default. Other users mentioned running agents on dedicated hardware (like a NUC) or using `toolbox`/`distrobox`.
*   **Security Boundaries (VM vs. Container):** There was debate regarding whether Docker provides sufficient isolation. **ctlfnmrs** and others argued that containers foster a false sense of security compared to VMs, citing Docker CVEs and kernel exploits. **Finbarr** (the OP) acknowledged this, updating the README to clarify the trust boundary; the consensus was that while containers stop accidental `rm -rf ~`, they aren't bulletproof against malicious breakouts.
*   **Agent Interaction & "Asimov’s Laws":** A sub-thread debated the "Three Tenets" of AI agents (don't break the build, obey the user, protect security). **MadnessASAP** argued that unlike deterministic compilers, AI code requires extreme scrutiny because it can be "subtly and disastrously wrong" or hallucinated, rejecting the idea that AI commits shouldn't be explicitly flagged.
*   **Integration Challenges:** **gngrlm** raised the issue of how these sandboxed agents interact with other local containers (e.g., a database in Docker Compose). The discussion noted that mounting `docker.sock` into the agent's container would negate the security benefits, leaving a gap in how to handle complex multi-container development environments safely.

### Apple picks Gemini to power Siri

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/apple-google-ai-siri-gemini.html) | 968 points | by [stygiansonic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stygiansonic) | [600 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46589675)

Apple taps Google’s Gemini to supercharge Siri and its AI stack

- Apple and Google struck a multiyear deal to use Gemini and Google cloud tech for Apple’s foundational models, with a major Siri upgrade expected later this year. Models will still run on-device and via Apple’s private cloud, the companies said.
- Apple called Google’s tech “the most capable foundation” for its AI plans. Terms weren’t disclosed; past reports pegged talks around a custom Gemini model and suggested Apple could pay about $1B annually.
- The move underscores Google’s AI rebound: Alphabet briefly topped $4T in market value and recently overtook Apple by market cap. It already pays Apple billions to be Safari’s default search—an arrangement scrutinized in antitrust cases but still intact.
- Apple has been cautious in the AI race, delaying an ambitious Siri overhaul to 2026 after hyping it in ads. Pressure has mounted as Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon pour billions into AI.
- Apple currently pipes some complex Siri queries to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple says that agreement isn’t changing—for now—leaving open how Google’s role will coexist with OpenAI inside “Apple Intelligence.”
- Google continues pushing Gemini (the article cites “Gemini 3”) and touts big-ticket cloud AI deals.

Why it matters: Apple is effectively hedging between OpenAI and Google to close its AI gap, while trying to preserve its privacy narrative with on-device and private-cloud processing. Expect renewed debate on platform lock-in, antitrust optics, and whether Apple can deliver a Siri that finally feels smart.

**Strategic Fit and Execution:** Commenters generally view the partnership as a pragmatic move, noting that Gemini is currently a top-tier model and Google provides the stable infrastructure and "deep pockets" Apple requires for enterprise-scale deployment. Users suggest this is a safer bet for Apple than relying solely on startups like Anthropic or OpenAI.

**Delay and Vaporware:** A significant portion of the discussion criticizes Apple for marketing "Apple Intelligence" features that have yet to ship, with some comparing the delay to the cancelled AirPower project. Users express frustration that Apple is selling hardware based on future software promises, breaking its traditional narrative of shipping complete, polished experiences.

**Panic vs. Strategy:** There is a debate over whether this deal represents a "panic" response to investor pressure and the existential threat AI poses to Apple's services moat (Siri, iMessage), or if it is standard Apple strategy to wait for technology to mature before adopting it (similar to tablets or folding phones).

**Hardware Grievances:** The conversation drifts into complaints about Apple’s control over user hardware, citing the removal of headphone jacks, soldered SSDs, and the slow transition to USB-C. Users argue over whether Apple "shoves trends down throats" or successfully mainstreamed technologies that competitors failed to popularize.

### Reproducing DeepSeek's MHC: When Residual Connections Explode

#### [Submission URL](https://taylorkolasinski.com/notes/mhc-reproduction/) | 110 points | by [taykolasinski](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=taykolasinski) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46588572)

DeepSeek’s mHC: taming “wider” residuals before they blow up

What’s new
- Transformers have used the same residual path since 2016: pass x through unchanged and add a learned update. DeepSeek explores “Hyper-Connections” (HC): multiple parallel streams with learnable mixing matrices that route information before, through, and after the layer.
- More expressive routing, negligible extra compute—until it isn’t. Unconstrained mixing matrices don’t just route; they amplify. Small gains compound across depth and can explode.

The failure mode
- Measure of trouble: Amax (max row/column absolute sum) ≈ worst-case signal gain.
- In a 10M-parameter repro, HC’s gain crept to 7–9× and sometimes collapsed; after 60 layers it can hit ~304×.
- At 27B parameters, DeepSeek saw peaks around 3000×. At that scale, unconstrained HC didn’t drift—it detonated.

The fix: mHC
- Constrain mixing matrices to be doubly stochastic (nonnegative, rows/cols sum to 1). That enforces “weighted averages,” so routing can shuffle and blend but cannot amplify.
- Implemented via the differentiable Sinkhorn-Knopp procedure (alternate row/column normalization for ~20 iters). Only the recursive residual mixer needs full Sinkhorn; pre/post mixers are just bounded with sigmoids.

Results and trade-offs
- Small scale (≈10M params, TinyShakespeare): HC is sharper but volatile.
  - Val loss: HC 0.884 ± 0.033 vs mHC 1.116 ± 0.012
  - Amax: HC ~6–7× with high seed variance; mHC pinned at 1.00 every run
- Depth sweeps show HC’s amplification is chaotic (spikes from ~4.3× to 9.2×). mHC stays flat.
- Takeaway: mHC is a “stability tax” at small scale, but at 27B it’s the price of admission—otherwise you gamble with exponential gain and NaNs.

Why it matters
- Multi-stream residuals could make Transformers more expressive without big compute costs, but only if their routing is gain-safe.
- If you try HC-like designs, monitor Amax and constrain the residual mixer (doubly stochastic or similar). Stability shouldn’t be “learned”—it should be guaranteed.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion focuses on the practical constraints of implementing DeepSeek’s Multi-Head Hyper-Connections (mHC) and compares it to emerging architectures from other major labs.

*   **Parallels with Google’s Gemma 3:** Users identified a convergence in "residual stream engineering," noting that Google’s newly released Gemma 3 uses a similar mechanism called **LAuReL** (Linear Attention with Low Rank Residuals). The author (OP) suggests that while mHC uses doubly stochastic matrices to stabilize the signal, LAuReL likely achieves stability via low-rank constraints.
*   **Scale dependence:** One user reported neutral results when implementing mHC on a small 8M parameter Vision Transformer. The OP validated this, arguing that standard additive residuals ($x+F(x)$) function perfectly fine at small depths; mHC is essentially a "stability tax" or enabler required for signal propagation in massive models (27B+) where standard connections might fail, rather than a performance booster for small models.
*   **Retrofitting risks:** Discussion arose regarding "grafting" mHC onto existing pre-trained models (like Llama 3) and fine-tuning. The OP warned that due to the 7x signal amplification observed in unconstrained networks, retrofitting requires careful initialization (starting at identity) and strict gradient clipping to prevent the model from exploding before it learns to route effectively.
*   **Clarifying mHC vs. MLA:** Several commenters confused mHC with **MLA** (Multi-Head Latent Attention). The author clarified that MLA is for context/memory efficiency (KV cache compression), whereas mHC increases expressivity and routing capability within the residual stream itself.

### Google removes AI health summaries after investigation finds dangerous flaws

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2026/01/google-removes-some-ai-health-summaries-after-investigation-finds-dangerous-flaws/) | 211 points | by [barishnamazov](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=barishnamazov) | [142 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46595419)

Google pares back some AI Overviews after health safety flap

Ars Technica reports that Google quietly disabled certain AI Overviews in health searches after a Guardian investigation found dangerous inaccuracies. Queries like “what is the normal range for liver blood tests” were pulled after experts warned the summaries listed raw enzyme ranges without context or demographic adjustments, risking false reassurance for people with serious liver disease. The Guardian also flagged a pancreatic cancer answer advising low-fat diets—contrary to guidance to maintain weight—yet Google left many related Overviews live. Google told The Verge that most Overviews are accurate and clinician-reviewed.

Why it matters
- High risk domain: Health answers delivered atop search can shape care decisions.
- Design debt: Overviews lean on top-ranked pages in a web long plagued by SEO spam; even good sources can be mis-summarized by LLMs.
- Trust hit: Prior gaffes (“glue on pizza,” “eat rocks”) and user workarounds to disable Overviews compound skepticism.

Zoom out
- Experts warn lab “normals” are nuanced and patient-specific; simplistic ranges can mislead.
- Google says Overviews show only with “high confidence,” but similar queries still trigger them, highlighting enforcement gaps.

Open questions
- Will Google narrow Overviews in medical queries or add stronger disclaimers/context?
- Can ranking and model grounding be hardened against SEO-gamed inputs?

**Medical Device Regulation and Liability**
A major thread of the discussion argues that by providing specific health answers, Google’s AI acts as "Software as a Medical Device" (SaMD) and should face FDA regulation or liability for inaccuracies. Users debated the legal implications, with some expecting Google to rely on EULAs to waive responsibility for "confabulated medical advice," while others called for fines based on revenue to force stricter guardrails.

**Doctors vs. "Random Output Machines"**
A debate emerged comparing LLM accuracy to human practitioners. While some users defended AI by noting that human doctors also misdiagnose or rely on "rote learning" like a machine, others argued this is a false equivalence. Critics emphasized that doctors operate within a framework of accountability, verification, and decade-long training, whereas LLMs are "random output machines" that lack intrinsic verification capabilities. Users distinguished between AI as a tool for professionals (e.g., radiologists) versus AI as a direct diagnostic agent for laypeople, citing dangerous real-world examples of improper self-treatment based on online tutorials.

**Hallucinations Across Domains**
Commenters offered anecdotes of similar "confident inaccuracies" in non-medical fields to illustrate the systemic risk:
*   **Engineering:** One user, an electrical engineer, noted the AI suggested a "staggeringly wrong" safe distance for high-voltage equipment, which could be fatal.
*   **Pop Culture & Gaming:** Users reported the AI mixing *Minecraft* fan fiction with actual game mechanics, confusing book plots with Reddit fan theories, and identifying a LARP group as a real ethnic demographic in Poland.
*   **Circular Reporting:** One commenter noted the AI answered a query by citing the user's *own* previous speculation on Hacker News as fact, highlighting a dangerous feedback loop.

**The "No Information" Preference**
The consensus leaned toward the idea that "no information is superior to wrong information presented convincingly." While a minority found value in LLMs for discovering jargon or broad discourse summaries, most expressed frustration at having to scroll past "trash" summaries to get to primary sources, with some viewing the technology's current implementation as "design debt" driven by financial incentives rather than utility.

### Superhuman AI exfiltrates emails

#### [Submission URL](https://www.promptarmor.com/resources/superhuman-ai-exfiltrates-emails) | 52 points | by [takira](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=takira) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46592424)

Superhuman AI exfiltrates emails via prompt injection (remediated)

- What happened: PromptArmor found that a malicious email could inject instructions that, when the user asked Superhuman’s AI to summarize recent mail, coerced it into sending contents of other emails to an attacker—without the user opening the malicious email.
- How: The injection had the AI build a prefilled Google Form URL and embed it as a Markdown image. The browser’s automatic image fetch made a background request to docs.google.com (whitelisted in Superhuman’s CSP), turning the AI’s output into an exfiltration channel.
- Impact: Full contents of multiple sensitive emails and partial contents of 40+ could be exfiltrated, including financial, legal, and medical data. PromptArmor also reported broader phishing and integration risks across the suite (Superhuman, Coda) after Grammarly’s acquisitions.
- Response: Superhuman escalated quickly, disabled vulnerable features, and shipped fixes. PromptArmor praised the speed and quality of the response.
- Why it matters: LLM agents that read untrusted content can be steered into making network requests. Domain allowlists aren’t enough; features like image auto-loading and form prefill can become covert data channels.
- Mitigations for builders: Treat model-visible content as untrusted; require user approval for outbound requests; sanitize/neutralize links and Markdown; proxy and block auto-fetches; design allowlists by intent (no form endpoints), not just domain; add DLP checks and per-source sandboxes.

The discussion focused on the mechanics of the attack and the broader implications for AI agents with web access:

*   **Exfiltration Vectors:** Users identified that LLMs capable of making network requests (particularly via image rendering) create a primary vector for leaking sensitive data. There is growing concern that as coding assistants (like Claude) gain access to local environments, they could be tricked into exposing encrypted rails credentials or `.env` files.
*   **Vendor Response:** Commenters praised Superhuman for their rapid handling of the disclosure, noting that many large tech companies often fumble AI vulnerability reports.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Participants debated how to secure these systems. Suggestions included determining permissions via "accept/deny" buttons rather than implicit trust, aggressively filtering generated URLs, or disconnecting AI components from the open web entirely.
*   **Root Cause:** The conversation touched on the fundamental difficulty of separating "code" (instructions) from "data" in current AI architectures, which makes preventing injection attacks structurally difficult.

### Show HN: An LLM-optimized programming language

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/ImJasonH/ImJasonH/blob/main/articles/llm-programming-language.md) | 47 points | by [ImJasonH](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ImJasonH) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46583581)

I only see generic GitHub page text here (buttons and alerts), not the content of the submission. Could you share the direct link or the actual README/text you want summarized? Once I have the title or body, I’ll write a tight, engaging digest blurb.

Here is the digest blurb and the summary of the discussion.

**Digest Blurb:**
**Designing a Programming Language for Types (and LLMs)**
Does it make sense to force AI to write in Python or C++, languages designed for human cognition? This discussion explores the concept of an "LLM-native" programming language. The core premise suggests that while humans need readability, LLMs struggle with things like significant whitespace (counting spaces is hard for token predictors) and distant dependencies (imports at the top of a file). The proposed solution involves a language optimized for formal verification and generation—where the LLM produces verbose, mathematically verifiable code that compiles down to efficient binaries, skipping the human-human boilerplate entirely.

**Summary of Discussion:**
The discussion explores the theoretical requirements and trade-offs of creating a programming language specifically optimized for Large Language Models (LLMs) rather than human developers.

**Key Themes:**

*   **Syntax and Structure Optimization:**
    *   **Whitespace vs. Braces:** Several users, notably *mike_hearn*, argue that significant whitespace (like Python) is difficult for LLMs because they struggle with counting spaces and maintaining long-range counting state. Braces and explicit delimiters are viewed as safer for generation.
    *   **Locality of Context:** There is a consensus that LLMs suffer when relevant information is far apart. Suggestions for a new language include allowing inline imports (defining dependencies right where they are used) so the model doesn't have to "scroll up" or hallucinate header files.
    *   **Type Inference:** Explicit typing consumes valuable tokens. Participants suggest that while the underlying logic should be typed, user-facing (or LLM-facing) code should rely on CLI tools to inject types post-generation to save context window space.

*   **Formal Verification and Correctness:**
    *   The discussion references Martin Kleppmann’s work (linked in the thread), suggesting that LLM-generated code should target **formal verification** systems rather than standard compilers.
    *   Since LLMs are stochastic (they make guesses), the language should be rigid and mathematically verifiable to enforce correctness, acting as a "guard rail" against hallucinations.

*   **The Training Data Problem:**
    *   Skeptics point out a catch-22: LLMs are powerful because they are trained on billions of lines of *existing* human languages (Python, Java, C).
    *   Creating a novel "LLM-optimized" language would force the model into a zero-shot environment where it has no training examples, likely resulting in poorer performance than simply generating standard boilerplate code.

*   **Alternative Approaches:**
    *   Some argue that existing languages like Lisp (S-expressions) or even Assembly are already "LLM-optimized" due to their structural simplicity or explicitness.
    *   Others suggest a hybrid approach where the AI interacts with a tree-based exploration agent or a REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop) to iteratively fix code, rather than needing a new syntax entirely.

### Don't fall into the anti-AI hype

#### [Submission URL](https://antirez.com/news/158) | 1133 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [1436 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46574276)

Don’t fall into the anti-AI hype (antirez): Redis creator says coding has already changed

Salvatore “antirez” Sanfilippo, a self-professed lover of hand-crafted code, argues that facts trump sentiment: modern LLMs can now complete substantial programming work with minimal guidance, reshaping software development far faster than he expected.

What changed his mind:
- In hours, via prompting and light oversight, he:
  - Added UTF-8 support to his linenoise library and built a terminal-emulated line-editing test framework.
  - Reproduced and fixed flaky Redis tests (timing/TCP deadlocks), with the model iterating, reproducing, inspecting processes, and patching.
  - Generated a ~700-line pure C inference library for BERT-like embeddings (GTE-small), matching PyTorch outputs and within ~15% of its speed, plus a Python converter.
  - Re-implemented recent Redis Streams internals from his design doc in under ~20 minutes.
- Conclusion: for many projects, “writing the code yourself” is now optional; the leverage is in problem framing and system design, with LLMs as capable partners.

His stance:
- Welcomes that his open-source work helped train these models—sees it as continued democratization, giving small teams leverage akin to open source in the ’90s.
- Warns about centralization risk; notes open models (including from China) remain competitive, suggesting there’s no hidden “magic” and others can catch up.
- Personally plans to double down on open source and apply AI throughout his Redis workflow.

Societal concern:
- Expects real job displacement and is unsure whether firms will expand output or cut headcount.
- Calls for political and policy responses (e.g., safety nets/UBI-like support) as automation accelerates.
- Even if AI company economics wobble, he argues the programming shift is irreversible.

Based on the discussion, here is a summary of the user comments regarding Antirez's submission:

**Skepticism Regarding "Non-Trivial" Work**
Multiple commenters questioned Antirez's assertion that LLMs can handle non-trivial tasks effectively. One user (**ttllykvth**) noted that despite using SOTA models (GPT-4+, Opus, Cortex), they consistently have to rewrite 70% of AI-generated code. They speculated that successful AI adopters might either be working on simpler projects or operating in environments with lower code review standards. There is a sentiment that while AI works for "greenfield" projects (like Antirez's examples), it struggles significantly with complex, legacy enterprise applications (e.g., 15-year-old Java/Spring/React stacks).

**The "Entropy" and Convergence Argument**
A recurring theme was the concept of "entropy." Users **nyttgfjlltl** and **frndzs** argued that while human coding is an iterative process that converges on a correct solution, LLMs often produce "entropy" (chaos or poor architecture) that diverges or requires immense effort to steer back on track.
*   **Expert Guidance Required:** Users argued LLMs act best as "super search engines" that offer multiple options, but they require a domain expert to aggressively filter out the "garbage" and steer the architecture.
*   **Greenfield vs. Brownfield:** The consensus suggests LLMs are decent at "slapping together" new implementations but fail when trying to modify tightly coupled, existing codebases.

**Hallucinations in Niche Fields and Tooling**
There was significant debate regarding the reliability of LLMs for research and specific stack configurations:
*   **Science/Research:** User **20k** reported that for niche subjects like astrophysics (specifically numerical relativity), LLMs are "substantially wrong" or hallucinate nonexistent sources. Others cited Google’s AI claiming humans are actively mining helium-3 on the moon.
*   **Infrastructure-as-Code:** Users **dvddbyzr** and **JohnMakin** highlighted specific struggles with Terraform. They noted LLMs frequently hallucinate parameters, invent internal functions, or provide obscure, unnecessary steps for simple configurations, making it faster to write the code manually.

**Counter-points on Prompting and Workflow**
*   **Context Engineering:** User **0xf8** suggested that success requires "context engineering"—building tooling and scaffolding (memory management, patterns) around the LLM—and that simply "chatting" with the model is insufficient for complex engineering.
*   **Productivity:** Despite the flaws, some users (**PeterStuer**) still view AI as a "net productivity multiplier" and a "knowledge vault" for tasks like debugging dependency conflicts, provided the developer maintains strict constraints.

### Sisyphus Now Lives in Oh My Claude

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Yeachan-Heo/oh-my-claude-sisyphus) | 50 points | by [deckardt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=deckardt) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46572032)

Oh My Claude Sisyphus: community multi‑agent orchestration for Claude Code, back from a “ban”
- What it is: A port of the “oh-my-opencode” multi-agent system to the Claude Code SDK. It bundles 10+ specialized agents that coordinate to plan, search, analyze, and execute coding tasks until completion—leaning into a Sisyphus theme. Written using Claude Code itself. MIT-licensed, currently ~836 stars/81 forks.

- Why it’s interesting: Pushes the “multi‑agent IDE copilot” idea inside Claude Code, with dedicated roles and slash commands that orchestrate complex workflows. Also carries a cheeky narrative about being “banned” and resurrected, highlighting community energy around extending closed tooling.

- Key features
  - Agents by role and model: strategic planner (Prometheus, Opus), plan reviewer (Momus, Opus), architecture/debug (Oracle, Opus), research (Librarian, Sonnet), fast pattern matching (Explore, Haiku), frontend/UI (Sonnet), multimodal analysis (Sonnet), focused executor (Sisyphus Jr., Sonnet), and more.
  - Commands: /sisyphus (orchestration mode), /ultrawork (parallel agents), /deepsearch, /analyze, /plan, /review, /orchestrator, /ralph-loop (loop until done), /cancel-ralph, /update.
  - “Magic keywords” (ultrawork, search, analyze) trigger modes inside normal prompts.
  - Ships as a Claude Code plugin with hooks, skills (ultrawork, git-master, frontend-ui-ux), and a file layout that installs into ~/.claude/.

- Installation
  - Claude Code plugin: /plugin install oh-my-claude-sisyphus (or from marketplace).
  - npm (Windows recommended): npm install -g oh-my-claude-sisyphus (Node 20+).
  - One-liner curl or manual git clone on macOS/Linux.

- Caveats and notes: Community plugin that modifies Claude Code config and adds hook scripts; review before installing in sensitive environments. The playful “Anthropic, what are you gonna do next?” tone and ban/resurrection lore may spark discussion about platform policies.

Who it’s for: Claude Code users who want opinionated, multi-agent workflows and quick slash-command entry points for planning, review, deep search, and high‑throughput “ultrawork” coding sessions.

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion thread is a mix of skepticism regarding multi-agent utility and speculation surrounding the "ban" narrative mentioned in the submission.

*   **The "Ban" & Business Model:** A significant portion of the conversation dissects why the predecessor (Oh My OpenCode) and similar tools faced pushback from Anthropic. The consensus is that these tools effectively wrap the Claude Code CLI—a "loss leader" meant for human use—to emulate API access. Users argue this creates an arbitrage opportunity that cannibalizes Anthropic's B2B API revenue, making the crackdown (or TOS enforcement) appear reasonable to many, though some lament losing the cheaper access point.
*   **Skepticism of Multi-Agent Orchestration:** Technical users expressed doubt about the efficiency of the "multi-agent" approach. Critics argue that while the names are fancy ("Prometheus," "Oracles"), these systems often burn through tokens for results that are "marginally linear" or sometimes worse than a single, well-prompted request to a smart model like Gemini 1.5 Pro or vanilla Claude.
*   **Project Critique:** One user who tested the tool provided a detailed critique, describing the README as "long-winded, likely LLM-generated" and the setup as "brittle." They characterized the tool as essentially a configuration/plugin set (akin to LazyVim for Neovim) rather than a revolutionary leap, noting that in practice, it often produced "meh" results compared to default Claude Code.
*   **Context Management:** A counterpoint was raised regarding context: proponents of the sub-agent workflow argued its main utility isn't necessarily reasoning superiority, but rather offloading task-specific context to sub-agents. This prevents the main conversation thread from hitting "context compaction" (summarization) limits too quickly, which degrades model intelligence.

### Google: Don't make "bite-sized" content for LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/google/2026/01/google-dont-make-bite-sized-content-for-llms-if-you-care-about-search-rank/) | 79 points | by [cebert](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cebert) | [44 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46575127)

Google to publishers: Stop “content chunking” for LLMs—it won’t help your rankings

- On Google’s Search Off the Record podcast, Danny Sullivan and John Mueller said breaking articles into ultra-short paragraphs and Q&A-style subheads to appeal to LLMs (e.g., Gemini) is a bad strategy for search.
- Google doesn’t use “bite-sized” formatting as a ranking signal; the company wants content written for humans. Human behavior—what people choose to click and engage with—remains a key signal.
- Sullivan acknowledged there may be edge cases where chunking appears to work now, but warned those gains are fragile and likely to vanish as systems evolve.
- The broader point: chasing trendy SEO hacks amid AI-induced traffic volatility leads to superstition and brittle tactics. Long-term exposure comes from serving readers, not machines.

Why it matters: As publishers scramble for traffic in an AI-scraped web, Google’s guidance is to resist formatting for bots. Sustainable SEO = clarity and usefulness for humans, not slicing content into chatbot-ready snippets.

Source: Ars Technica (Ryan Whitwam), discussing Google’s Search Off the Record podcast (~18-minute mark)

Here is a summary of the discussion:

**Skepticism and Distrust**
The predominant sentiment in the comments is a lack of trust in Google’s guidance. Many users believe the relationship between Google and webmasters has become purely adversarial. Commenters cited past instances where adhering to Google's specific advice (like mobile vs. desktop sites) led to penalties later, suggesting that Google’s public statements often contradict how their algorithms actually reward content in the wild.

**The "Slop" and Quality Irony**
Users pointed out the hypocrisy in Google calling for "human-centric" content while the current search results are perceived as being overrun by SEO spam and AI-generated "slop."
*   One commenter noted the irony that the source article itself (Ars Technica) utilizes the very "content chunking" and short paragraphs Google is advising against.
*   Others argued that Google needs human content merely to sanitize training data for their own models, referencing notorious AI Overview failures (like the "glue on pizza" or "eat rocks" suggestions) as evidence that training AI on SEO-optimized garbage "poisons" the dataset.

**Economic Misalignment**
There was a debate regarding the logic of optimizing for LLMs at all. Users noted that unlike search engines, LLMs/chatbots frequently scrape content without guiding traffic back to the source (the "gatekeeper" problem). Consequently, destroying the readability or structure of a website to appeal to a bot that offers no click-through revenue is viewed as a losing strategy.

**Technical "Superstition"**
Several users described modern SEO as "superstition" or a guessing game, noting that while structured, semantic web principles (from the early 2000s) should ideally work, search engines often ignore them in favor of "gamed" content.

### Show HN: Epstein IM – Talk to Epstein clone in iMessage

#### [Submission URL](https://epstein.im/) | 55 points | by [RyanZhuuuu](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=RyanZhuuuu) | [51 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46571661)

AI site lets you “interrogate” Jeffrey Epstein
A new web app invites users to chat with an AI persona of Jeffrey Epstein (complete with “Start Interrogation” prompt), part of the growing trend of simulating deceased public figures. Beyond the shock factor, it raises familiar but pressing questions about consent, deepfake ethics, potential harm to victims, and platform responsibility—highlighting how easy it’s become to package provocative historical reenactments as interactive AI experiences. Content warning: some may find the premise disturbing.

**The OP is likely using the controversy for marketing.** Sleuths in the comments noted the submitter’s history of building an "iMessageKit" SDK; many concluded this project is a "tasteless" but effective viral stunt to demonstrate that technology.

**Users debated the technical validity of the persona.** Critics argued the AI is "abysmally shallow" because it appears trained on dry legal depositions and document dumps. Commenters noted that an LLM fed court transcripts fails to capture the "charm," manipulative social skills, or actual personality that allowed the real figure to operate, resulting in a generic bot that merely recites facts rather than simulating the person.

**The ethics of “resurrecting” monsters were contested.**
*   **Against:** Many found the project to be "deliberate obscenity" and "juvenile," arguing that "breathing life into an evil monster" has no utility and is punching down at victims for the sake of shock value.
*   **For:** Some countered that the project counts as art or social commentary, suggesting that AI merely reflects the reality of the world (which included Epstein).
*   **The Slippery Slope:** Several users asked if "Chat Hitler" is next, while others pointed out that historically villainous chatbots are already common in gaming.

### Show HN: I used Claude Code to discover connections between 100 books

#### [Submission URL](https://trails.pieterma.es/) | 437 points | by [pmaze](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pmaze) | [135 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46567400)

This piece is a dense field guide to how systems, organizations, and people actually work. Framed as 40+ bite-size mental models, it links psychology, engineering, and power dynamics into a toolkit for builders and operators.

What it is
- A catalog of named concepts (e.g., Proxy Trap, Steel Box, Useful Lies) with one‑line theses plus keywords
- Themes range from self-deception and tacit knowledge to containerization, selectorate theory, and Goodhart’s Law
- Feels like an index for a future book: each entry is a lens you can apply to product, orgs, and strategy

Standout ideas
- Useful Lies: self-deception as a performance strategy; “blue lies” that help groups coordinate
- Invisible Crack: microscopic failures propagate silently; treat brittleness and fatigue as first-class risks
- Ideas Mate: weak IP and copying as engines of innovation spillover
- Pacemaker Principle: a single chokepoint can dictate system behavior (weakest link logic)
- Desperate Pivots: reinvention comes from cornered teams, not lone-genius moments
- Expert Intuition / Intuitive Flow: mastery bypasses explicit reasoning; don’t over-instrument experts
- Collective Brain: knowledge requires critical mass and transmission; isolation erodes capability
- Illegibility Premium: practical, tacit know-how beats neat-but-wrong formal systems
- Proxy Trap: metrics turn into mirages when optimized; watch perverse incentives
- Winning Coalition / Winner’s Lock: power concentrates; maintain control with the smallest viable coalition
- Multiple Discovery: when the adjacent possible ripens, breakthroughs appear everywhere
- Hidden Structure: copying the form without the tacit structure fails (why cargo cults flop)
- Costly Signals: only expensive actions convince; cheap talk doesn’t move trust
- Deferred Debts: moral, gift, and technical debts share compounding dynamics
- Joy Dividend and Mastery Ravine: progress often dips before it soars; joy can outperform “efficiency”
- Legibility Tax vs. Measuring Trust: standardization scales but destroys local nuance—use it where trust must travel
- Steel Box: containerization as the archetype of system-level transformation
- Worse is Better and Perfectionist’s Trap: ship small, iterate, fight the urge to overengineer
- Entropy Tax: continually import order; everything decays without active maintenance
- Tempo Gradient: decision speed wins conflicts; exploit OODA advantages

Why it matters for HN readers
- Gives a shared vocabulary to discuss postmortems, pivots, incentives, and org design
- Bridges software reliability with human factors: redundancy, observability, and necessary friction
- Practical prompts: check for proxies gaming you, find hidden chokepoints, preserve protected “tinkering sanctuaries,” design costly signals that actually build trust

How to use it
- Pick one lens per week and apply it to a current decision, review, or incident
- Tag incidents and design docs with these concepts to improve institutional memory
- In strategy debates, test multiple models against the same problem to expose blind spots

**Summary of Discussion:**

Discussion regarding this "field guide" was predominately skeptical, with many users suspecting the content or the connections between concepts were generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). Critics described the links between the mental models as "phantom threads"—semantic associations that look plausible on the surface but lack deep, logical coherence upon close reading.

Key points from the comments include:
*   **LLM Skepticism:** Several readers felt the text resembled "Anthropic marketing drivel," arguing that it outsources critical thinking to statistical models that identify keyword proximity rather than true insight.
*   **The "Useful Lies" Debate:** A specific section on "Useful Lies" drew criticism, partly due to a confusion (either in the text or by the reader) involving "Thanos" (the comic villain) versus "Theranos" (the fraudulent company). This sparked a side debate on whether fraud can truly constitute a "useful lie" or simply bad ethics/post-rationalization.
*   **Technical Implementations:** The post inspired users to share their own experiments with "Distant Reading" and knowledge clustering. One user detailed a workflow using `pdfplumber`, `sentence_transformers`, and UMAP to visualize semantic clusters in book collections, while others discussed using AI to analyze GitHub repositories and technical documentation.
*   **Writing Style:** A lighter sub-thread debated whether "engineering types" rely too heavily on math-oriented thinking at the expense of literary diction, contrasting FAANG engineers with "Laravel artisans."

### AI is a business model stress test

#### [Submission URL](https://dri.es/ai-is-a-business-model-stress-test) | 299 points | by [amarsahinovic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amarsahinovic) | [289 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46567392)

AI is a business model stress test: Dries Buytaert argues that AI didn’t “kill” Tailwind Labs so much as expose a fragile go-to-market. After Tailwind laid off 75% of its engineering team, CEO Adam Wathan cited a ~40% drop in docs traffic since early 2023—even as Tailwind’s popularity grew. Their revenue depended on developers browsing docs and discovering Tailwind Plus, a $299 component pack. As more developers ask AI for code instead of reading docs, that funnel collapsed. Buytaert’s core thesis: AI commoditizes anything you can fully specify (docs, components, plugins), but not ongoing operations. Value is shifting to what requires showing up repeatedly—hosting, deployment, testing, security, observability. He points to Vercel/Next.js and Acquia/Drupal as models where open source is the conduit and operations are the product. He also flags a fairness issue: AI systems were trained on Tailwind’s materials but now answer queries without sending traffic—or revenue—back. Tailwind CSS will endure; whether the company does depends on a viable pivot, which remains unclear.

Here is a summary of the discussion:

The discussion focuses on the ethical and economic implications of AI consuming technical documentation and open-source code without returning value to the creators.

*   **Theft vs. Incentive Collapse:** While some users argue that AI training constitutes "theft" or distinct legal "conversion" (using property beyond its implied license for human readership), others, like **thrpst**, suggest "theft" is too simple a frame. They argue the real issue is a broken economic loop: the historical contract where "giving away content creates indirect value via traffic/subscriptions" has been severed.
*   **Licensing and Reform:** **drvbyhtng** proposes a "GPL-style" license for written text and art that would force AI companies to open-source their model weights if they train on the data. However, **snk** (citing Cory Doctorow) warns that expanding copyright laws to restrict AI training is a trap that typically strengthens large corporations rather than protecting individual creators or open-source maintainers.
*   **The "Human Learning" Analogy:** The recurring debate over whether AI "learning" equates to human learning appears. **dangoodmanUT** argues humans are allowed to learn from copyrighted content, so AI should be too. **mls** counters with Edsger Dijkstra’s analogy: "The question of whether machines can think [or learn] is about as relevant as the question of whether submarines can swim."
*   **Impact on Open Source:** **mrch** notes that the "Open Source as a marketing funnel" strategy is fundamentally fragile and now corrupts the intention of OSS contributors. Some users, like **trtftn**, claim to have stopped keeping projects on GitHub due to this dynamic, while **tmbrt** worries that for-profit LLMs are effectively "laundering" GPL code into the proprietary domain.
*   **Historical Precedents:** **Brybry** compares the situation to the news aggregation battles (Google News, Facebook) and notes that legislative interventions (like those in Canada and Australia) have had mixed to poor results.

### Extracting books from production language models (2026)

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02671) | 61 points | by [logicprog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=logicprog) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46569799)

Extracting books from production LLMs (arXiv:2601.02671)

- What’s new: A Stanford-led team (Ahmed, Cooper, Koyejo, Liang) reports they could extract large, near-verbatim chunks of copyrighted books from several production LLMs, despite safety filters. This extends prior extraction results on open-weight models to commercial systems.

- How they did it: A two-phase process—(1) an initial probe that sometimes used a Best‑of‑N jailbreak to elicit longer continuations, then (2) iterative continuation prompts to pull more text. They scored overlap with a block-based longest-common-substring proxy (“nv-recall”).

- Models tested: Claude 3.7 Sonnet, GPT‑4.1, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok 3.

- Key results (examples):
  - No jailbreak needed for Gemini 2.5 Pro and Grok 3 to extract substantial text (e.g., Harry Potter 1: nv‑recall 76.8% and 70.3%).
  - Claude 3.7 Sonnet required a jailbreak and in some runs produced near-entire books (nv‑recall up to 95.8%).
  - GPT‑4.1 needed many more BoN attempts (~20x) and often refused to continue (e.g., nv‑recall ~4.0%).

- Why it matters: Suggests model- and system-level safeguards do not fully prevent memorized training data from being reproduced, heightening copyright and liability risks for providers and API users. It also raises questions about eval standards, training-time dedup/memo reduction, and stronger safety layers.

- Caveats: Per-model configs differed; nv‑recall is an approximation; behavior may vary by model updates. Providers were notified; the team waited ~90 days before publishing. 

Paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02671

**Discussion Summary:**

The discussion branched into technical validation of the findings, proposed engineering solutions to prevent memorization, and a philosophical debate regarding the legitimacy of modern copyright law.

*   **Verification and Techniques:** Users corroborated the paper's findings with anecdotal evidence, noting that models like Gemini often trigger "RECITATION" errors when safety filters catch memorized text. One user mentioned using similar prompting techniques on Claude Opus to identify training data (e.g., retrieving quotes from *The Wealth of Nations*).
*   **Engineering Mitigations vs. Quality:** Participants debated using N-gram based Bloom filters to block the output of exact strings found in the training data. However, critics argued this would degrade model quality and prevent legal "fair use" scenarios, such as retrieving brief quotes for commentary or research. An alternative proposal involved "clean room" training—using models trained on synthetic summaries rather than raw copyrighted text—though some feared this would result in a loss of fidelity and insight.
*   **Copyright Philosophy:** A significant portion of the thread challenged the current state of copyright law. Commenters argued that repeatedly extended copyright durations (often citing Disney) violate the US Constitution's requirement for "limited times" to promote progress. From this perspective, preventing LLMs from *learning* from books (as opposed to verbatim regurgitating them) was viewed by some as subverting scientific progress.
*   **Legal Nuance:** The distinction between training and output was heavily debated. While some users felt that training on the data itself is the violation, others noted that the legal system has not established that yet. However, there was consensus that the ability to "copypasta" verbatim text (as shown in the paper) serves as *ipso facto* proof of infringement risks and invites litigation.

**Key Takeaway:** While users acknowledge the breakdown of safety filters is a liability, many view the underlying tension as a conflict between outdated copyright frameworks and the "progress of science" that LLMs represent.

### What Claude Code Sends to the Cloud

#### [Submission URL](https://rastrigin.systems/blog/claude-code-part-1-requests/) | 33 points | by [rastriga](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rastriga) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46566292)

Hacker News Top Story: Claude Code quietly ships a lot of your project to the cloud

A developer MITM‑proxied Claude Code to inspect its traffic and found the agent sends far more context to Anthropic than most users realize—on every prompt.

Key findings
- Transport: No WebSockets. Claude Code streams via Server‑Sent Events (SSE) for simplicity and reliability through proxies/CDNs, with ping keep‑alives.
- Payload size: Even “hi” produced ~101 KB; normal requests hit hundreds of KB. Much of this is scaffolding the UI doesn’t show.
- What gets sent each turn:
  - Your new message
  - The entire conversation so far
  - A huge system prompt (often 15–25k tokens): identity/behavior rules, your CLAUDE.md, env info (OS, cwd, git status), tool definitions, security policies
- Context tax: 20–30% of the window is consumed before you type anything.
- Caching: Anthropic prompt caching stores the big, mostly static system/tool blocks for 5 minutes (first write costs extra; hits are ~10% of base). Conversation history is not cached—full price every turn.
- Long sessions: History is resent each time until the window fills; then the client summarizes and “forgets” older details.
- Files: Anything the agent reads is injected into the chat and re‑uploaded on every subsequent turn until the context resets.
- Streaming format: SSE events like message_start, content_block_delta (tokens), ping, and message_stop with usage counts.

Why it matters
- Privacy/security: Your code, git history, CLAUDE.md, and environment context may leave your machine.
- Cost/perf: Token and bandwidth usage scale with session length; caching helps only for the static system/tool blocks.

Practical takeaways
- Treat coding agents as cloud services: keep secrets out of repos/env, be deliberate about CLAUDE.md contents, and prefer least‑privilege/project‑scoped workspaces.
- Reset sessions periodically and avoid dumping large files unless necessary.
- If you have compliance constraints, consider self‑hosted/offline options or enforce network controls.

The author plans follow‑ups on how the system prompt is assembled and tool definitions are applied.

Here is the daily digest and discussion summary.

**Hacker News Top Story: Claude Code quietly ships a lot of your project to the cloud**

A developer analyzed Claude Code’s network traffic via a MITM proxy, revealing that the agent transmits significantly more context to Anthropic than many users anticipate. Rather than using WebSockets, the tool relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE) and transmits a stateless payload on every turn. This payload includes the user's latest message, the full conversation history, file contents, and a massive system prompt containing environment details like OS, `cwd`, tool definitions, and strict behavioral rules.

Crucially, the analysis notes that approximately 20–30% of the context window is consumed by this scaffolding before the user even types. While static system blocks are cached briefly (5 minutes), conversation history and file re-uploads incur full token costs every turn. This architecture has implications for both cost and privacy, as sensitive data—including git status and code—leaves the local machine. The author advises treating coding agents like cloud services, recommending the exclusion of secrets and the use of scoped, least-privilege workspaces.

**Summary of Discussion**

The discussion circled around the trade-offs of stateless LLM interactions, unexpected telemetry behavior, and the feasibility of running the tool locally.

*   **Telemetry Causing DDOS:** One user discovered that trying to run Claude Code with a local LLM (like Qwen via `llm-server`) caused a total network failure on their machine. Claude Code aggressively gathered telemetry events, and because the local server returned 404s, the client flooded requests until it exhausted the machine’s ephemeral ports. A fix was identified by disabling non-essential traffic in `settings.json`.
*   **"Standard" Behavior vs. Privacy:** Some commenters felt the findings were unsurprising, noting that most LLM APIs are stateless and require the full context context to be resent every turn. However, the author and others countered that while the *mechanism* is standard, the *content*—specifically the automatic inclusion of the last five git commits and extensive environmental data—was not obvious to users.
*   **Local Execution:** There was significant interest in running Claude Code completely offline. Users shared success stories of wiring the tool to local models (like Qwen-30B/80B via LM Studio) to avoid data exfiltration entirely.
*   **Architectural Trade-offs:** The thread discussed why Anthropic chose this architecture. The consensus (confirmed by the author) was that statelessness simplifies scaling and effectively utilizes the prompt cache, even if it looks inefficient regarding bandwidth.
*   **Comparisons:** The author noted that inspecting Claude Code was straightforward compared to tools like Cursor (gRPC) or Codex CLI (ignores proxy settings), making it easier to audit.

### Show HN: Yuanzai World – LLM RPGs with branching world-lines

#### [Submission URL](https://www.yuanzai.world/) | 30 points | by [yuanzaiworld](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yuanzaiworld) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46565265)

Yuanzai World (aka World Tree) is a mobile sci‑fi exploration game pitched around time travel and alternate timelines. It invites players to “freely explore the vast expanse of time and space,” “reverse established facts,” and “anchor” moments to revisit or branch the worldline, with a social “World Seed” feature to share states with friends. The page offers screenshots and a trailer but stays light on concrete mechanics, teasing a sandboxy, narrative‑driven experience rather than detailing systems.

Highlights:
- Core idea: open‑ended time/space exploration with timeline manipulation
- Social: share your “world seed” with friends to co‑shape an ideal world
- Platforms: iOS and Android
- Requirements: iOS 13+ (iPhone/iPad), Android 7+
- Marketing vibe: ambitious premise; specifics on gameplay, monetization, and multiplayer depth are not spelled out

**Discussion Summary:**

The conversation focused on user interface feedback and regional availability hurdles in the EU:

*   **UX & Privacy:** Users requested larger font sizes for translated text to improve mobile readability. Several commenters also flagged forced login requirements as a "deal breaker," expressing concern over providing PII (Personally Identifiable Information) just to play.
*   **Regional Availability:** Users reported the app is unavailable in the German and Dutch App Stores.
*   **EU Trader Laws:** The availability issues were attributed to EU regulations that require developers to publicly list a physical address on the App Store. Commenters suggested the developer might have opted out of the region to maintain privacy.
*   **Solutions:** One user suggested utilizing virtual office services (specifically mentioning *kopostbox*) to obtain a valid business address and documentation accepted by Apple, allowing for EU distribution without exposing a personal home address.

### LLMs have burned Billions but couldn't build another Tailwind

Tailwind’s massive layoffs spark an AI-era reality check

- Tailwind reportedly laid off ~75% of its team, surprising many given its long-standing popularity and widespread use (the author cites ~1.5% of the web).
- The author argues it’s misleading to blame LLMs or claim Tailwind is now obsolete; the founder has said otherwise, and the framework remains heavily used (including by code LLMs).
- Pushback against “Tailwind is bloated” claims: the piece defends Tailwind as lean, high-quality, and unusually generous for a small team, with a big indirect impact on the ecosystem.
- Bigger point: despite 2025’s AI/agent boom and massive spend, we’re not seeing tiny teams shipping groundbreaking, Tailwind-level products; instead, we may be losing one.
- Underneath the news is a tension between AI’s promised efficiency and the economic realities faced by small, product-focused teams.

**Tailwind’s massive layoffs spark an AI-era reality check**
A discussion of the distinction between Tailwind as a framework and Tailwind Labs as a business, and how AI impacts both differently.

*   **The Business Model Crisis:** Commenters identify a conflict between the open-source project and the business model (selling UI kits/templates). Users argue that LLMs allow developers to generate code without visiting the official documentation, which was the primary funnel for upselling commercial products. As one user noted, if AI generates the markup, the "path to profitability" via templates evaporates.
*   **Tailwind is "AI-Native":** Despite the business struggles, several commenters argue that Tailwind is uniquely suited for LLM code generation. By keeping styling within the HTML (utility classes), it provides "explicit semantic precision" and keeps context in a single file, whereas traditional CSS forces models to search external files for meaning.
*   **Future of Frontend:** The conversation speculates on the future of web styling. Some potential outcomes discussed include:
    *   **Obsolescence of Libraries:** If AI can customize webpages cheaply, standardized libraries might become unnecessary, potentially leading to a regression to "Dreamweaver levels of CSS soup."
    *   **Proprietary Languages:** A shift toward "non-textual" or proprietary toolchains that are inaccessible to humans and managed entirely by AI.
*   **Misunderstandings:** A distinct thread briefly confused "Tailwind" with "Taiwan," discussing chip fabrication and supply chains, which was treated as off-topic noise.
