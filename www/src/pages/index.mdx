YouTube has announced new policies and tools to address AI-generated content on its platform, including deepfakes. YouTube creators will now be required to disclose when they have created altered or synthetic content that appears realistic, particularly when it relates to sensitive topics like elections or ongoing conflicts. The company warns that creators who fail to properly disclose their use of AI consistently may face content removal, suspension from the YouTube Partner Program, or other penalties. YouTube will also allow users to request the removal of AI-generated or other synthetic content that simulates an identifiable individual, such as a deepfake. However, YouTube clarifies that not all flagged content will be removed, leaving room for parody or satire. The company is also working on a system to compensate artists and rightsholders for AI-generated music.

The discussion on this submission revolves around several different points. 

One commenter, xngpd, mentions that YouTube's policies may not adequately address AI-generated content on the platform. They point out that even using an AI-generated script for a video's subtitle or search title can result in numerous videos with seemingly human interactions in the comments, potentially misleading viewers. They suggest that deleting the comments or downvoting and reporting the videos and channels might be more effective.
In response to xngpd's comment, lern_too_spel argues that YouTube's policy of requiring disclosure of altered or synthetic content does not necessarily apply to the videos being discussed. They explain that the problem lies with YouTube's recommendation system.
Another commenter, dttnw, sadly admits to being someone who watches AI-generated content. They mention that the nonsensical generated content still manages to garner a lot of views. They also point out that many content creators slow down their speech, which makes it easier for AI-generated content scripts to mimic them, especially when translated into different languages.
Sncntd highlights that one of the biggest issues on YouTube is its handling of DMCA takedown notices for AI-generated content, particularly in cases such as product reviews. They mention that addressing this is important and that YouTube is likely aware of this issue.
Dttnw also makes a crosspost to another thread related to the topic.
Lastly, QVVRP4nYz adds that YouTube possibly cannot handle the vast volume of deepfake misinformation that is published on its platform, suggesting that the problem is much larger than what is being discussed.

Overall, the discussion touches on various concerns regarding YouTube's policies and the challenges it faces in dealing with AI-generated content, including deepfakes and misleading recommendations.

A team of researchers in China has developed an AI-powered robot chemist that can extract oxygen from water on Mars. The robot uses materials found on the red planet to produce catalysts that break down water, releasing oxygen. The study, published in Nature Synthesis, involved analyzing meteorites that mimic the Martian surface and using an AI-powered system to search for a chemical that could break down water. The result was an oxygen-evolution reaction catalyst that could potentially be used on a future Mars mission. While the robot's ability to produce oxygen from water is impressive, some experts argue that there are easier ways to produce oxygen on Mars, such as through NASA's Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE). Nevertheless, the AI-powered robot chemist could have potential uses for synthesizing other useful materials on Mars and beyond.

The discussion on this submission covers several topics. One commenter discusses the technical details of the AI-powered robot chemist, explaining the thermodynamic reactions involved in extracting oxygen from water. Another commenter discusses the use of AI in classifying strings and the Turing completeness of regular expressions. There is also a discussion about the potential waste of materials in the Martian atmosphere and the challenges of sustaining human civilization on Mars. Some commenters argue that there are more practical and efficient ways to produce oxygen on Mars, while others discuss the importance of nitrogen in the Martian ecosystem and the potential for terraforming Mars. Additionally, there is a discussion about Elon Musk and his role in space exploration, with some commenters expressing skepticism and others defending his ideas.
