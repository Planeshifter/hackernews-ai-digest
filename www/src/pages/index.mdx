### The Wrong Way to Use a Signed Distance Function (SDF)

#### [Submission URL](https://winterbloed.be/the-wrong-way-to-use-a-signed-distance-function/) | 41 points | by [AnthonBerg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=AnthonBerg) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43517365)

In a delightful exploration of creative coding, a recent dive into signed distance functions (SDFs) sparked a conversation about the playful misuse of mathematical tools to create striking visual art. Inspired by Mike Brondbjerg's Twitter share showcasing particles floating through a field, a novel approach to using SDFs emerged. Typically associated with raytracing and shaders for defining smooth, meshless geometry, SDFs are getting a new life. By leveraging these functions, you can generate rich point clouds that, when processed a step further, yield visually stunning renders.

Imagine particles colliding with spheres in an abstract dance—this is brought to life by calculating distances from particles to sphere centers, determining interactions based on their spatial relationship. By creatively manipulating these functions, the space is divided into regions: inside, on, or outside the sphere. It gets even more intriguing when noise is added to the equation, an unorthodox move that challenges mathematical rigor but opens up boundless creative possibilities.

This exploration of geometric collisions and transformations doesn’t stop at spheres. By swapping the SDF with functions for other shapes like boxes or toruses, the creative playground expands. The joy of this method lies in its versatility—one can combine different signed distance functions for complex results without getting tangled in mathematical rigor.

Though the concepts are often presented in the realm of OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL), integrating them into Processing and other platforms is very possible. This fusion of math and art might not strictly adhere to traditional SDF requirements, but it exemplifies the spirit of creative coding—embracing chaos while crafting beauty.

The discussion revolves around a disagreement about the relevance and implications of referencing Twitter in an article about creative coding with signed distance functions (SDFs). Here's a concise summary of the exchange:

1. **Downvote Justification**: A user (*Dylan16807*) downvoted the submission, arguing that the article’s reference to a 2020 tweet and its perceived anti-Twitter stance lacked rigor. They criticized the article for indirectly dismissing Twitter’s role in broader societal contexts (e.g., democracy) and questioned the relevance of using outdated social media posts.

2. **Counterargument**: Another user (*tlkngtb*) acknowledged valid points but countered that the criticism was overly reductive. They suggested that judging the article’s stance on Twitter (and equating it to a rejection of pro-democracy values) imposed a rigid, binary interpretation. The focus, they argued, should be on the technical creativity of the SDF exploration, not politicizing the platform used for inspiration.

3. **Nuance vs. Binary Thinking**: *Dylan16807* reiterated their stance, emphasizing that referencing Twitter—especially older posts—could carry unintended political weight. They accused critics of oversimplifying the debate, asserting that supporting Twitter’s societal role doesn’t negate valid critiques of its use in technical articles.

**Key Takeaway**: The debate highlights tensions between technical content and the perceived socio-political implications of citing platforms like Twitter. While one side saw the reference as a problematic overreach, the other viewed the critique as an unnecessary distraction from the article’s creative focus.

In a pioneering study by Anthropic, titled "Transformer Circuits Thread: On the Biology of a Large Language Model," researchers bring a biological investigative approach to understanding the inner workings of language models, focusing on Claude 3.5 Haiku. This model, released in October 2024, is Anthropic's current lightweight production solution. Much like biologists dissecting the complexity of living organisms, the team aims to demystify the mechanisms transforming simple training algorithms into sophisticated language abilities.

Drawing a novel parallel to microscopes revolutionizing biology, the researchers use cutting-edge tools to probe language models' insides, identifying fundamental computational units they call "features" analogous to biological cells. However, understanding these building blocks alone isn’t enough; understanding their interactions, akin to mapping a brain’s wiring, is crucial.

The key tool in their investigation is attribution graphs, which trace how a model transforms specific inputs into outputs. These graphs allow researchers to form hypotheses about underlying mechanisms, refined through detailed experiments.

Their paper delves into several intriguing findings:

1. **Multi-step Reasoning**: The model can internally perform complex reasoning, like deducing that "the capital of the state containing Dallas" is "Austin."

2. **Planning in Poems**: Remarkably, Claude 3.5 plans its poetic structures by pre-selecting rhyming words, influencing line construction from the start.

3. **Multilingual Circuits**: The model balances language-specific and abstract circuits, with more prominence in the former compared to smaller models.

4. **Addition and Medical Diagnoses**: Circuits adept at basic arithmetic generalize that process, and the model can simulate clinical reasoning by hypothesizing diagnoses based on symptoms.

5. **Entity Recognition and Hallucinations**: The model’s ability to discern known entities affects its information reliability, with misfires causing hallucinations.

6. **Harmful Request Refusal**: It generalizes a "harmful requests" feature from specific examples learned during fine-tuning.

7. **Jailbreak Analysis and Chain-of-thought Faithfulness**: The team explores how syntax manipulation tricks the model into providing dangerous instructions, and they critically analyze whether the model truly performs stated reasoning steps.

This research not only advances understanding of language models but also shapes future AI safety and utility in real-world applications. As the team pushes the frontier in transparency, their work echoes long-standing scientific traditions of questioning and illumination.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Anthropic's Study:**

   Users tested Claude 3.5 Haiku’s ability to reject harmful requests. One example involved prompting the model to write an advertisement advocating mixing bleach and ammonia—a dangerous combination. While the model refused, a fabricated "safe" ad highlighted risks of anthropic systems being tricked or misunderstood. Sub-comments compared the model’s internal reasoning to fictional character monologues, sparking debates about transparency in its decision-making.

2. **Anthropomorphism Debates**:  
   The study’s use of terms like “planning” and “choosing” drew criticism for potentially misleading anthropomorphism. Critics argued these terms imply human-like intent, while supporters defended the analogy as useful for understanding emergent behaviors. Some suggested treating AI as complex machinery (akin to artificial life studies) rather than human-like agents.

3. **Technical Appreciation**:  
   Users praised the paper’s visualizations of activation networks and attribution graphs, which demystify internal model processes. The interdisciplinary approach, blending biology and AI, was lauded, with recommendations for further reading on emergent complexity.

4. **Plausibility of "Planning"**:  
   Skeptics questioned whether the model truly “plans” (e.g., rhyming in poems) or merely follows statistical patterns. Requests were made for evidence of structured sub-task execution, challenging the study’s claims about multi-step reasoning.

5. **Open-Source & Replication**:  
   Some hoped for open-source replication of the work to explore features like pre-selecting rhyming words. Others speculated on the feasibility of replicating Anthropic’s findings with smaller models.

6. **Industry Comparisons**:  
   Discussions compared Anthropic’s work to competitors like Meta, xAI (Grok), and OpenAI. Users debated Grok 3’s consumer-friendly features versus Claude’s safety focus, alongside broader trends in AI job markets and corporate research priorities.

7. **Cultural Impact**:  
   A lighthearted comment likened Anthropic to Studio Ghibli, humorously framing the company as a creator of "magical" AI systems.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects enthusiasm for transparency in AI mechanics, skepticism about anthropomorphic language, and curiosity about real-world safety and reproducibility. Debates underscore the tension between mechanistic explanations and human-centric metaphors in AI research.

### Estimating Camera Motion from a Single Motion-Blurred Image

In an intriguing development from the University of Oxford, researchers Jerred Chen and Ronald Clark have introduced a groundbreaking approach turning a common photographic flaw—motion blur—into a potent tool for estimating camera velocity. Dubbed "Image as an IMU," their method cleverly harnesses motion blur not as a defect to be corrected, but as a rich source of information for deducing camera movement. 

This innovative framework operates by predicting a dense motion flow field and a monocular depth map directly from a single motion-blurred image, allowing it to recover the camera's instantaneous velocity through a linear least squares solution. It sidesteps the arduous task of deblurring, presenting an IMU-like measurement system that not only addresses but thrives during fast and aggressive camera motions, a common challenge in robotics and VR/AR applications.

The researchers trained their model using a vast dataset featuring realistic synthetic motion blur, enhancing accuracy with real-world data through a fully differentiable pipeline. In impressive evaluations, the model outperformed existing methods, such as MASt3R and COLMAP, particularly in angular and translational velocity estimates.

Despite the model's reliance on a solitary, motion-blurred frame, it impressively determines velocity without multi-frame requirements, achieving real-time performance at 30 Hz, even with disambiguation steps included. Utilizing just an iPhone 13 Pro for data collection, this method stands out for its speed and efficiency, offering fresh insights into overcoming the dynamic challenges posed by camera motion blur. 

The code and supplementary data supporting this paper will soon be made available for further exploration, promising a new frontier in camera motion estimation.

Some pointed to existing deblurring resources (e.g., GitHub repositories) and noted the challenges of distinguishing focus, motion blur, and camera shake in 2D images.  

2. **Depth Estimation Questions**:  
   - Participants debated whether depth extraction is inherently part of the process, with references to the paper’s abstract clarifying that it predicts **monocular depth maps** directly from motion-blurred images.  

3. **Historical Context**:  
   - A user connected the research to early-2000s VFX workflows in films like *Scooby-Doo* and *Narnia*, highlighting parallels with legacy motion-recovery algorithms used in visual effects.  

4. **Humor and Off-Topic Threads**:  
   - Light-hearted exchanges included jokes about LLMs (Large Language Models) "taking over," misplaced mentions of **Rust programming**, and tongue-in-cheek remarks about making the world a better place. Another user humorously noted the lack of LLMs in the paper despite their mention in the comments.  

5. **Practical Applications**:  
   - A commenter speculated about potential uses for inverted radial/directional motion blur shaders, while others contrasted the method’s efficiency versus conventional deblurring approaches.  

Overall, the discussion blended technical scrutiny of the method’s innovations with nostalgia for past industry practices, alongside playful asides reflecting the community’s diverse engagement.

### Clean, a formal verification DSL for ZK circuits in Lean4

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.zksecurity.xyz/posts/clean/) | 70 points | by [vons](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vons) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43496577)

In the ever-evolving field of cryptography, zero-knowledge (ZK) circuits hold tremendous potential but are often plagued with bugs. To address these challenges, a team has embarked on a groundbreaking project, introducing an embedded Domain-Specific Language (DSL) and formal verification framework for ZK circuits within Lean4. This ambitious endeavor is part of the broader zkEVM Formal Verification Project, aiming to develop reliable infrastructure and tools to confidently verify zkEVMs.

Their initiative, dubbed "Clean," is focused on defining ZK circuits, specifying their desired properties, and most crucially, formally proving their correctness. By integrating these elements into Lean4, they plan to create a library of robust, reusable, and formally verified circuit gadgets. Currently targeting the AIR arithmetization, the framework assumes a table lookup primitive within the underlying proof system, setting the stage for accurate formal reasoning about ZK circuits.

The project zeroes in on two pivotal properties in formal verification: soundness and completeness. Soundness ensures that any witness satisfying the constraints inherently upholds a specific property, preventing underconstrained circuits. Completeness guarantees that for every valid input, a witness can be found to satisfy the constraints, avoiding overconstrained circuits.

By supporting basic operations such as witness introduction, assertion of constraints, lookup relations, and subcircuit integration, the framework aims to make circuit definition intuitive and syntactically natural. A monadic interface further enhances usability, allowing developers to write and compose ZK circuits seamlessly.

The formal verification framework's backbone is the "FormalCircuit" structure, which encapsulates the circuit's core operations, assumptions, specifications, and the necessary proofs for soundness and completeness. This structured approach ensures a rigorous verification process, fortifying the reliability of ZK circuits against potential errors.

For those curious to dive deeper into these novel developments, a presentation featured in the zkEVM project updates call offers additional insights. As the project evolves, it promises to be a transformative leap towards securely leveraging zero-knowledge proofs in complex cryptographic systems.

The discussion revolves around clarifying terminology related to the submission about the **Clean project** (a DSL for zero-knowledge circuits in the zkEVM ecosystem). Here's a concise breakdown:

1. **Confusion about "EOF" and "EVM":**  
   - A user asks what **EOF** and **EVM** stand for.  
   - Another user explains:  
     - **EOF** refers to the **Ethereum Object Format**, a new bytecode format for the Ethereum Virtual Machine ([EVM](https://vmbjctfrmtrg)).  
     - **Clean** is the domain-specific language (DSL) for writing zero-knowledge proof circuits, which is part of the broader zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine) project.  

2. **Abbreviation Challenges:**  
   - The conversation highlights initial confusion due to heavy use of abbreviations (e.g., "EOF," "EVM," "DSL"), but the key terms are resolved through clarification.  

3. **Connection to the Submission:**  
   - The Clean project’s focus on formal verification of ZK circuits is indirectly tied to EVM via zkEVM, which aims to bring zero-knowledge proofs to Ethereum’s execution layer.  

In summary, the discussion clarifies that **EOF** is an Ethereum-related bytecode format, while **Clean** is a tool for building formally verified ZK circuits within the zkEVM ecosystem.

### Parameter-free KV cache compression for memory-efficient long-context LLMs

A fascinating advancement in the realm of long-context language models was unveiled in a paper titled "ZeroMerge: Parameter-Free KV Cache Compression for Memory-Efficient Long-Context LLMs," by Xin Liu and colleagues. The research tackles the pressing issue of key-value (KV) cache memory growth and computational complexity, which restrict efficiency in large language models (LLMs). Traditional KV cache optimization methods have their downsides, often leading to information loss or necessitating costly retraining processes. However, ZeroMerge introduces a novel, dynamic zero-shot compression framework that innovatively manages cache memory without relying on parameter retraining.

The method stands out with its three pivotal innovations: using multi-dimensional token importance metrics for fine-grained memory allocation, preserving critical context through a unique residual merging mechanism, and offering a parameter-free adaptation compatible across various LLM architectures. Impressively, ZeroMerge has been tested on the LLaMA-2 model and demonstrates maintaining performance at astonishingly low 5% compression ratios while doubling inference throughput for 40,000-token lengths. This positions ZeroMerge as a powerful solution, effectively balancing memory efficiency, generation quality, and deployment flexibility, crucial for the evolving field of practical long-context LLM applications. For those interested, the authors have made their code available online.
