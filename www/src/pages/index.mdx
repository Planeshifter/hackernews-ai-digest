### The Mirror Fusion Test Facility (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.beautifulpublicdata.com/the-mirror-fusion-test-facility/) | 117 points | by [not_a_boat](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=not_a_boat) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40257843)

In 1986, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory celebrated the completion of the "Mirror Fusion Test Facility-B" (MFTF-B) with a dedication ceremony attended by 300 individuals. However, just as the project was finalized after a decade of development and almost a billion dollars in funding, it was shut down on the same day without ever being turned on. The reasons behind this decision were rooted in budget pressures, with then-Secretary of Energy John Herrington expressing regret in a letter to program director T. Kenneth Fowler.

The MFTF-B project featured impressive components, such as a 400-ton "yin-yang" magnet that was the largest superconducting magnet in the world at the time. This magnet, capable of generating magnetic fields 150,000 times that of Earth's, was designed to contain the high-temperature plasma required for fusion energy research. Despite the shutdown, the quest for fusion energy continued, with scientists at the National Ignition Facility achieving a significant milestone in 2022 by recording a fusion reaction with a net energy gain.

The 1970s energy crisis spurred interest in alternative energy sources like nuclear fusion, leading to substantial investments in fusion research. Two main approaches emerged from this period: the torus-shaped "tokamak" design and the magnetic mirror approach exemplified by the MFTF-B. While the tokamak design was more widely adopted, the MFTF-B represented a different path in the pursuit of fusion energy.

The decision to pursue the MFTF-B at such a large scale was met with debate and uncertainty, with factors like ideology and strategic considerations playing a role. Despite the disappointment of having the project mothballed immediately after completion, the researchers were left grappling with the abrupt end of their ambitious endeavor.

At the recent TechCrunch Early Stage event in Boston, Rudina Seseri from Glasswing Ventures discussed the unique challenges that AI startups face compared to traditional SaaS companies. She emphasized the importance of having algorithms and data at the core of an AI company, rather than just integrating AI APIs superficially.

Seseri highlighted the differences in how customers and investors evaluate AI startups versus SaaS startups. Unlike SaaS products that can be rolled out in beta form, AI products require a mature model that customers can trust. This complexity in training algorithms and gaining customer trust makes it harder to find early adopters.

To succeed in the AI space, Seseri advised startups to focus on solving a specific problem with measurable outcomes for the buyer. She suggested emphasizing the business value of AI solutions and staking a defensible position in the market. While big players control the infrastructure and foundation layers of AI, there are opportunities for startups in the application and middle layers.

Seseri recommended investing in the application layer of AI and prioritizing access to unique data and algorithms. She recognized the challenges of building an AI startup but believes that understanding these challenges and building strategically can lead to success in this promising field. In conclusion, while AI startups face steep hurdles, they hold the key to the future of software growth.

The comments on Hacker News primarily discuss the key points made by Rudina Seseri at the TechCrunch Early Stage event in Boston regarding the unique challenges that AI startups face compared to traditional SaaS companies. Users diverge on their perspectives with joenot443 emphasizing the importance of not just wrapping AI APIs around a company, but developing AI at the core, while bnnylv provides a counterpoint by suggesting that companies often need to start by using existing tools before innovating. NomDePlum and plddrpr touch on the applications of AI-powered technology in military encryption and the differences in reliability, quality, and functionality. Moving away from the content of the submission, hzyc reflects on the contrasting experiences of Boston VCs compared to those in the Bay Area, suggesting a potential disconnect, and ShamelessC expresses disappointment in investors' seeming lack of self-awareness.

### Real-time AI using scalable non-expert crowdsourcing in colorectal surgery

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-024-01095-8) | 20 points | by [zachwdc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zachwdc) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40237883)

A new study published on nature.com discusses the use of real-time near-infrared artificial intelligence in colorectal surgery, aiming to improve patient safety and clinical outcomes. The research demonstrates a method to gather surgical tissue annotations through crowdsourcing of non-experts, allowing for the training and deployment of an accurate AI model for surgical anatomy recognition. This innovative approach could potentially reduce complications like anastomotic leaks in bowel surgery.

The study utilized a gamified crowdsourcing platform to obtain annotated training data from 95 colorectal procedures, saving significant expert hours that would have been required for annotation. The crowdsourced annotations were used to train a soft tissue segmentation AI model called Bowel.CSS, which accurately segmented bowel and abdominal wall tissues in real-time. The primary endpoints of the study included assessing the expertise level of the crowdsource workers, expert hours saved, accuracy of the crowdsource annotations compared to expert annotations, and the accuracy of the Bowel.CSS model predictions against expert annotations.

This groundbreaking research showcases the potential of utilizing non-expert crowdsourcing to advance surgical artificial intelligence and improve surgical outcomes. The discussion on this submission seems to be quite unusual and not directly related to the content of the study. Comments include mentions of "grph prbblty stry gghx ttl fnctn nmbr ttl wrds rd rmrkbl" by user karma_pharmer, a comparison to Foldit in surgery games by user zchthwf, and a mention of "SphincterIt" by karma_pharmer. User HumanOstrich simply says "Gross," and TraumaLlama adds "dd." Overall, the discussion appears to be more on the playful or random side rather than focusing on the actual content of the study.
