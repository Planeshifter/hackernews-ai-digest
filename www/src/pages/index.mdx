### Solving Path of Exile Item Crafting with Reinforcement Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://dennybritz.com/posts/poe-crafting/) | 86 points | by [dennybritz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dennybritz) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40958436)

The post dives into the world of Path of Exile (PoE), an intricate ARPG game notorious for its complexity. Crafting in PoE involves modifying item attributes to create powerful gear, but the process is daunting for many due to a high risk of failure. Players often opt to buy items instead of crafting them. The article delves into the question of whether an algorithm can be used to learn the optimal sequence of crafting actions for a target item in PoE.

In PoE, crafting involves changing item modifiers through various actions to achieve a desired outcome. The post explains the mechanics of item modifiers, the limitations on the number of prefixes and suffixes an item can have, and the probability distribution of obtaining modifiers based on the item's base type, level, and existing modifiers.

Crafting in PoE can involve multiple steps, including applying currency or using crafting benches, with outcomes being stochastic. The post provides a simplistic example of crafting a Void Sceptre to illustrate the complexity of the process. Crafting in PoE can range from simple actions to highly intricate strategies that require careful planning and knowledge of modifier distributions.

The Cradle framework, a groundbreaking project in the field of artificial intelligence, aims to empower foundation agents to achieve general computer control. By providing a unified interface where agents receive visual input from screens and perform actions using keyboard and mouse operations, Cradle enables agents to interact with any software or game without relying on specific APIs. This framework has shown remarkable generalizability and impressive performance across a variety of tasks, including navigating complex video games like Red Dead Redemption 2 and completing various software applications efficiently.

By leveraging a modular and flexible approach with six key components - Information Gathering, Self-Reflection, Task Inference, Skill Curation, Action Planning, and Memory - Cradle demonstrates the potential for agents to excel in diverse virtual environments. The use of advanced technologies like GPT-4o as the backbone model further enhances the framework's vision and reasoning capabilities.

With the goal of achieving General Computer Control (GCC) and enabling agents to master any computer task, Cradle paves the way for a new era of AI capabilities. By offering a standardized interface for interaction and focusing on efficient exploration and self-improvement, this framework opens up possibilities for agents to excel in navigating the digital world.
