YouTube is introducing a new tool that will require creators to disclose when their content includes altered or synthetic media, such as generative AI, to provide more transparency to viewers. The disclosure will appear as labels in the video description or on the front of the video player, helping viewers understand if the content they are seeing could be mistaken for real. The goal is to strengthen trust between creators and their audience by ensuring transparency.

Creators will need to disclose content that uses the likeness of a realistic person, alters footage of real events or places, or generates realistic scenes. However, disclosures are not required for content that is clearly unrealistic, animated, includes special effects, or uses generative AI for production assistance. The labels will be rolled out across all YouTube platforms, with a more prominent label for videos on sensitive topics like health, news, elections, or finance.

While YouTube aims to give creators time to adjust to the new process, enforcement measures may be considered for those who consistently do not disclose information about altered or synthetic content. In some cases, YouTube may add a label to a video even if the creator has not disclosed it, especially if the content has the potential to confuse or mislead viewers. This initiative reflects YouTube's commitment to increasing transparency around digital content and collaboration with industry organizations like the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity (C2PA).

Furthermore, YouTube continues to work on an updated privacy process for requesting the removal of AI-generated or synthetic content that simulates identifiable individuals. Creators remain central to YouTube, playing a vital role in helping audiences navigate the evolving landscape of generative AI and technology.

### The Coprophagic AI Crisis

#### [Submission URL](https://pluralistic.net/2024/03/14/inhuman-centipede/) | 40 points | by [MrVandemar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=MrVandemar) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39722283)

In the latest Hacker News story, science fiction writer Charlie Stross discusses the dangers of blurring the lines between science fiction and reality in the context of AI development. He highlights the misconception that simply adding more computational power will lead to conscious AI, likening it to a well-worn trope in science fiction.

Stross warns against the belief that increasing the AI's complexity through more data will automatically fix its flaws, pointing out the proliferation of inaccurate or fabricated content generated by AI, aptly termed "botshit." This flood of low-quality content poses a significant problem as it overwhelms and diminishes the quality of human-created content on the internet.

Furthermore, the narrative analogizes the AI's consumption of its own generated data to a form of coprophagy, where feeding on its own output leads to irreversible defects in models. This highlights the potential pitfalls of training AI on contaminated or low-quality data, emphasizing the importance of maintaining high standards in AI development.

Overall, the story serves as a cautionary tale about the potential consequences of relying solely on increased computational power and data to drive AI progress, urging for a more thoughtful and discerning approach to AI development.

The discussion following the submission on Hacker News covers various perspectives on the challenges and misconceptions surrounding AI development:

1. **rnx** mentions two major problems in the context of AI development: the somewhat conflicting emphasis on more power versus more managed training data. They argue that there is not particularly strong evidence that training data is the key factor in AI advancements, citing examples like AlphaGo where insufficient training data seems to have been effective. They also mention the transformative improvements in performance that AI has achieved without replicating human cognitive skills, challenging the notion that AI needs to mimic human capabilities to be effective.

2. **rkktmnsch** responds by criticizing the vague and confusing arguments made by the average person regarding AI performance, suggesting that many statements lack a logical basis and lead nowhere. They also tangentially bring up the concept of AI-driven self-landing ballistic rockets, highlighting the importance of a step-by-step approach to defining requirements and parameters in such a complex system.

3. **bmbzld** agrees with the discussion, pointing out the recent rise of postmodernism in art and suggesting a deconstructive rather than constructive approach may be more beneficial for AI development. They imply that a more spiritual approach may lead AI research in a better direction.

4. **tvrt** introduces a cyberpunk warning and suggestion, alluding to the potential dangers of AI in generating low-quality content like "botshit." They mention using AI for profit-driven purposes without regard for ethical considerations, highlighting the need for caution in how AI technologies are utilized.

Overall, the discussion reflects a mix of viewpoints on the current state and future directions of AI development, with considerations ranging from the technical challenges of training data to broader philosophical implications and ethical concerns surrounding AI technologies.
