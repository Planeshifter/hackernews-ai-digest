### Discord's face scanning age checks 'start of a bigger shift'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo) | 295 points | by [1659447091](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=1659447091) | [366 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715884)

In a move that's causing quite a stir, Discord is testing facial recognition software to verify the ages of some users in the UK and Australia. This initiative comes in response to the UK’s upcoming online safety laws, which require platforms hosting adult content to implement strong age verification measures by July. Technology experts suggest this shift is just the beginning of a broader trend toward enhanced verification processes online.

Matt Navarra, a social media expert, describes age assurance as “the new seatbelt for the internet,” stating that platforms failing to implement effective age checks risk losing users and facing legal consequences. Companies like Instagram have already paved the way by using AI to estimate user age through selfie videos, and Discord is following suit by offering users the choice of using a face scanner or photo ID for age verification.

The practice is not without controversy. Privacy advocates, including Big Brother Watch, argue that such technology presents risks, including potential security breaches and privacy intrusions. Despite these concerns, regulators and age verification bodies see a variety of methods available that they claim protect privacy and accurately estimate age.

Australia, on a parallel track, is moving towards banning social media for users under 16, noting that over 80% of children between 8 and 12 are already active on platforms meant for older users. This illustrates a global push for more stringent online safety protocols for younger internet users.

As these changes unfold, age verification becomes vital not just for user protection but as a critical compliance measure for companies facing significant financial penalties for non-compliance. This new era might signal the end of simple checkboxes confirming age, marking a profound evolution in how internet safety is managed.

Meanwhile, Discord is under pressure from legal fronts as well, with New Jersey's attorney general suing the company over alleged misleading safety controls. As the digital world adapts to new safety and privacy standards, the spotlight remains squarely on platforms like Discord and their handling of sensitive content access.

The discussion revolves around Discord's implementation of facial recognition for age verification and broader debates on online safety, privacy, and regulation. Key points include:

1. **Technical Challenges**:  
   Users highlight encryption technologies (TLS, DoH, ECH) as barriers to content filtering, making age verification technically complex. Critics argue that modern protocols and decentralized tools (VPNs, peer-to-peer networks) render traditional filtering methods ineffective, allowing minors to bypass restrictions.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Debates**:  
   References to the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and its overturning by the Supreme Court underscore historical tensions between regulation and free speech. Skepticism persists about new laws, with users questioning their enforceability and potential to create privacy risks (e.g., biometric data breaches).

3. **Parental vs. Governmental Responsibility**:  
   Some argue that parents, not governments or platforms, should oversee children’s online activity. Critics of strict regulation warn of "Orwellian" surveillance, while others advocate for client-side filtering tools or movements like "Wait Until 8th" (delaying smartphones until age 14). Schools’ struggles to manage device use in classrooms also reflect broader societal challenges.

4. **Privacy Concerns**:  
   Facial recognition and biometric verification are criticized as invasive, with fears that data could be exploited by third parties or governments. Comparisons are drawn to past privacy failures, such as Google’s anonymized data being re-identified.

5. **Societal and Cultural Shifts**:  
   Discussions note the normalization of early tech exposure, with children accessing explicit content despite restrictions. Some users emphasize social pressures and the difficulty of controlling peer-driven behavior, while others blame lax parenting or cultural individualism.

6. **Skepticism Toward Solutions**:  
   Age verification is seen as a flawed "check-the-box" compliance measure, unlikely to deter determined minors. Critics suggest the focus should shift to education and harm reduction rather than unenforceable bans.

The conversation reflects a clash between technological feasibility, privacy rights, and the practicality of regulating online behavior, with no clear consensus on effective solutions.

### Differentiable Programming from Scratch

#### [Submission URL](https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/) | 101 points | by [sksxihve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sksxihve) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713140)

Differentiable programming is revolutionizing various fields well beyond machine learning. While systems like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX have propelled its use in machine learning, this approach is now making waves in areas like computer graphics with innovations such as differentiable rendering, differentiable physics, and neural representations. Recognized in 3Blue1Brown’s Summer of Math Exposition 2, a recent article sheds light on this increasingly vital tool for tackling complex optimization problems.

To grasp differentiable programming, one must revisit key mathematical concepts starting with differentiation. The derivative, a staple of calculus, measures how a function's output changes with a tiny input variation. For instance, in one-dimensional functions, it represents the function's slope at a given point.

However, in higher dimensions, this concept transforms: the derivative becomes a map turning input vectors into output vectors. Take a function of two variables, for instance, which yields partial derivatives that together form the gradient—a vector indicating the direction of steepest ascent.

Understanding these mathematical underpinnings is crucial for implementing differentiable programming techniques effectively. Moreover, with the advent of automatic differentiation methods like forward and backward modes, programming for differentiation has become more streamlined, enabling applications such as image de-blurring and other optimization tasks in coding.

Differentiable programming is also about managing how function compositions are differentiated, employing the chain rule to handle more complex functions. When diving deeper, differentiable programming involves augmenting numerical and symbolic differentiation with sophisticated automatic differentiation techniques.

This expansion into various scientific and technological domains underscores the potential and importance of differentiable programming. As these methodologies continue to evolve and find new applications, they promise to further enhance our ability to solve intricate problems across disciplines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Differentiable Programming:**

The discussion highlights the historical roots, technical challenges, and modern debates surrounding differentiable programming (DP) and automatic differentiation (AD). Key points include:

1. **Historical Context**:  
   - DP/AD is not new; its foundations trace back to the 1960s–1990s, with early work in FORTRAN, contributions by Louis Rall (1981), and Andreas Griewank (2000). Critics note that modern ML/AI researchers often overlook or fail to cite this prior work, leading to concerns about academic integrity and "reinventing the wheel."

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **Numerical Stability**: Finite-difference methods face instability in high-dimensional spaces, with risks of catastrophic cancellation and computational infeasibility.  
   - **State and Purity**: AD requires functions to be "pure" (stateless) for reliable differentiation. Managing stateful variables or dynamic control flow (e.g., loops with variable iterations) complicates derivative calculations.  
   - **Compositionality**: Chain-rule applications in complex functions can fail if components violate derivative rules (e.g., adversarial compositions), though certain cases (eigenvalue derivatives) remain valid if phase choices are consistent.

3. **Language and Implementation**:  
   - AD can be integrated into existing languages (e.g., JavaScript, F#’s DiffSharp) without needing new domain-specific languages (DSLs). Functional programming paradigms simplify AD due to their emphasis on purity, but challenges persist in handling mutable state or optimizing memory in reverse-mode AD.  
   - Some argue that "differentiable programming" is more about augmenting existing systems with AD tools rather than inventing entirely new frameworks.

4. **Critique of Modern Research**:  
   - Participants criticize the ML community for neglecting historical literature, with anecdotes of researchers repackaging old ideas without proper attribution. This underscores a broader tension between rapid innovation and academic rigor.

In summary, while differentiable programming is driving advances in ML and beyond, the discussion emphasizes its deep historical roots, persistent technical hurdles, and the need for greater acknowledgment of foundational work.

### Building an AI that watches rugby

#### [Submission URL](https://nickjones.tech/ai-watching-rugby/) | 83 points | by [reddavis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reddavis) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43714902)

In an intriguing leap towards smarter sports analysis, Gainline, a rugby-centric app, is navigating the challenge of providing deeper insights into rugby games. While existing data covers the major events like tries and cards, it falls short in explaining why they happen. This gap in context is critical for fans who crave a more immersive second-screen experience.

The team behind Gainline embarked on an innovative journey to address this challenge—by developing a prototype AI capable of watching rugby games and extracting rich, contextual data directly from the visuals. The prototype hinges on OpenAI's vision model, which analyzes screenshots taken every five seconds from game footage. This AI doesn't just tell us who scored; it deciphers phases of play, game time, and team kits, restructuring them into readily usable data formats like JSON.

One of the primary experiments involved efficiently extracting key information like scores and game times. Instead of sending the model full-resolution screenshots (a costly endeavor), the team cleverly reduced the data size by cropping images to just focus on the scoreboard, a practical solution that significantly cut down on computational costs without needing fanciful image processing methods.

To add efficiency, an intriguing "diffing" method was contemplated—comparing frames to isolate and identify changes, like the scoreboard, using basic image comparison techniques. While still a work in progress, these minimalist approaches exemplify the project's ethos of simplicity over complexity.

This initiative opens a new horizon for rugby fans, promising rich narratives woven from AI-generated insights.

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without All the Bullshit (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/) | 221 points | by [ibobev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ibobev) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43700633)

If you've ever tried to wade through the jargon-riddled waters of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), you might find yourself wishing for a more straightforward guide to help you make sense of it all. Thankfully, a popular Hacker News article titled "Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without all the Bullshit" does just that, peeling back the layers of complexity to reveal the heart of the method.

At its core, MCMC is a powerful tool for sampling from complex probability distributions when direct sampling is challenging. Imagine trying to draw a baby name from a magical list according to your specific preferences. Armed only with a mysterious black-box function that can output the probability of each name, you find yourself facing the daunting task of efficiently drawing names in accordance with these probabilities—this is where MCMC steps in.

The trick lies in the clever use of something called a Markov chain, a type of random walk on a graph. Picture this: you have a set of names, and each name has links to others, with each link carrying a probability of transitioning from one name to another. By wandering through this network according to the probabilities on these connections, you create a chain of names that mimics the distribution you're aiming for.

This practical breakdown strips away the esoteric language often associated with MCMC, making it accessible to those less acquainted with statistical gobbledygook. With just fair random coins and a bit of patience, you can simulate these intricate processes and glean accurate estimates—whether you're calculating averages or deciphering the cryptic distributions in some Bayesian network.

Ultimately, this approachable explanation invites readers to see beyond the smokescreen of technical symbols and interpret MCMC as a beautifully simple—yet profoundly effective—tool in the ever-evolving field of data science.

The Hacker News discussion on the article "Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without all the Bullshit" revolves around the balance between simplifying complex concepts and maintaining technical accuracy. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Debates & Insights:

### Benn Jordan's AI poison pill and the weird world of adversarial noise

#### [Submission URL](https://cdm.link/benn-jordan-ai-poison-pill/) | 119 points | by [glitcher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=glitcher) | [186 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43695401)

In the evolving landscape of artificial intelligence and music, Benn Jordan has put forward an intriguing concept aimed at protecting artists from having their work exploited by generative AI music services. He introduces the notion of using "adversarial noise" as a strategic defense, a technique that is essentially a digital "poison pill" for AI data sets, preventing them from assimilating unauthorized music content. Although still in its early stages, the concept has captured attention for its potential to reshape how we interact with AI in creative spaces.

These techniques hinge on the fascinating world of adversarial noise poisoning—an area of AI research dedicated to manipulating and disrupting machine learning models. The strength of Jordan's approach lies in its adaptability: operating in the realm of sound, this method can affect any audio environment, potentially offering musicians a new layer of protection and control over their creations. What sets this apart is the ability to mask the audio in a way that's imperceptible to human listeners, but effectively "jams" AI attempts to study it.

The challenge remains significant, though, as executing these adversarial techniques demands substantial computational power, high-end hardware, and copious amounts of energy. However, as a proof of concept, it provides a launchpad for further innovation and refinement. The parallel here to early 2000s concerns over digital piracy is striking, except now the adversary is not human fans but machine algorithms.

Moreover, this has implications beyond mere protection from generative AI. Adversarial noise has applications in wider fields, including potential defense against AI surveillance—offering a glimpse into how humans might strategically interact with growing machine capabilities. The broader sphere of adversarial methods, encompassing everything from algorithm training to attack simulations, reveals the dual nature of these strategies: they serve both as a critique of AI's current limitations and a potential foundation for future development.

As we navigate the complex intersection of music, technology, and AI, Benn Jordan's innovative idea and ongoing research signify a critical step towards greater creative autonomy in the digital age, encouraging transparency and inviting a reflective approach to how AI reshapes our world.

The discussion around Benn Jordan's adversarial noise concept for protecting music from AI reveals a mix of technical skepticism, ethical debates, and cautious optimism. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Technical Challenges:
1. **Effectiveness Concerns**: Users cited Nicholas Carlini's [research](https://nicholascarlini.com/writing/2024/why--attack.html), arguing that adversarial defenses like noise poisoning are "fundamentally broken" because AI models can be retrained or data can be cleaned (denoised) to bypass such protections. For example, AI companies might filter out adversarial noise during preprocessing, rendering the defense obsolete.
2. **Evolving AI Models**: Advanced music generators (e.g., Riffusion) process audio as spectrograms, which could allow them to circumvent noise attacks. Techniques like phase randomization or filtering might neutralize adversarial perturbations, making the arms race between defenses and AI advancements unsustainable.
3. **Resource Intensity**: Implementing adversarial noise requires significant computational power, and maintaining such defenses as AI models evolve could become prohibitively expensive.

### Ethical and Practical Debates:
- **Copyright vs. Innovation**: Some argued that AI training on copyrighted material parallels human learning of abstract styles, raising questions about whether mimicking artistic styles infringes copyright. Others countered that AI companies profit from unlicensed data, calling for compensation models akin to music sampling rights.
- **Comparison to DRM**: Skeptics likened adversarial noise to early-2000s DRM—a well-intentioned but flawed solution. Optimists viewed it as a starting point for empowering artists, even if imperfect.

### Mixed Sentiment:
- **Praise for Concept**: Benn Jordan’s music-production background was noted as a strength, offering a practical, artist-centric approach. Some saw value in the idea as a symbolic stand for creative control.
- **Skepticism About Impact**: Critics doubted long-term viability, noting that AI’s rapid evolution could outpace defenses. The discussion highlighted an "arms race" dynamic, where adversarial techniques might only offer temporary protection.

### Broader Implications:
- The debate reflects wider tensions in AI ethics, touching on data ownership, labor (e.g., CAPTCHA-solving for AI training), and the need for legislative frameworks to address gaps in copyright law for generative AI.

In summary, while adversarial noise is seen as a creative countermeasure, its technical limitations and the adaptability of AI models cast doubt on its efficacy. The conversation underscores the need for both technological innovation and policy reform to balance artist rights with AI development.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03730) | 242 points | by [doener](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=doener) | [94 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43690955)

In a new push to embrace Europe's rich tapestry of languages, researchers have introduced Teuken-7B-Base and Teuken-7B-Instruct, two multilingual large language models (LLMs) that support all 24 official languages of the European Union. The team, led by Mehdi Ali and comprised of 38 collaborators, has worked to overcome the English-centric bias of existing LLMs by creating models trained predominantly on non-English data. Utilizing a tailor-made multilingual tokenizer, these models aim to improve performance across several language benchmarks, such as ARC, HellaSwag, MMLU, and TruthfulQA, specifically adapted for European contexts.

The models are detailed in an arXiv paper that delves into their development principles, including data composition, tokenizer optimization, and training methodologies. The work represents a significant step towards creating more inclusive language tools that reflect Europe's linguistic diversity. For those interested in learning more, the full paper is available on arXiv, and it promises to offer insights into the technical intricacies behind these cutting-edge language models.

The discussion revolves around multilingual LLM behaviors, challenges, and implications, with key points structured as follows:

### **Language Switching & Translation**
- Users observe models like ChatGPT and Claude often *switch languages mid-reasoning* (e.g., Chinese for calculations, English for final answers), suggesting non-English prompts may be internally translated to English for processing. This mirrors practices like translating Turkish queries to English and back for better results with models like Llama 70B.
- Some theorize LLMs use an *internal "lingua franca"* (likely English) for intermediate reasoning, especially for low-resource languages, due to training data biases.

### **Technical Factors**
- **Temperature settings**: Lower temperatures (e.g., 0) aim to reduce randomness but may not fully eliminate variability due to token sampling mechanics. Inference engines might use static seeds for reproducibility.
- **Programming language preferences**: LLMs perform better with languages like Python/JS due to abundant training data. Strict-syntax languages (e.g., Pascal, C89) pose challenges, as LLMs struggle with rigid structures and variable declarations.

### **Cultural & Linguistic Biases**
- Models often default to English or Western-centric outputs, reflecting training data dominance. For instance, French users note ChatGPT’s informal French lacks local slang, leaning toward “neutral” or formal styles.
- Debate arises around the *Sapir-Whorf hypothesis*: Could language choice reshape model reasoning? Anthropic’s research suggests Claude uses language-agnostic internal representations, hinting at abstract reasoning beyond specific languages.

### **Resource & Training Challenges**
- Low-resource languages struggle due to limited data, leading to reliance on translation pipelines or code-switching. Users note models may use explicit translation steps in training (e.g., translating non-English text to English and back), limiting fluency.
- Tokenization issues: Multilingual tokenizers may struggle with underrepresented languages, fragmenting words and reducing coherence.

### **Theoretical Insights**
- Anthropic’s work highlights cross-lingual reasoning capabilities, implying larger models may develop language-neutral internal representations. This aligns with observations of models like Teuken-7B, which emphasize linguistic inclusivity beyond English-centric paradigms.

### **Ironies & Anecdotes**
- Jokes about ChatGPT sprinkling random Chinese characters or ancient Greek in outputs underscore the unpredictability of multilingual generation.
- French users humorously critique ChatGPT’s “generic” French, likening it to a textbook rather than native speech.

### **Implications for Teuken-7B**
- The discussion underscores the importance of Teuken’s focus on **EU language equity** through tailored tokenizers and non-English data. Challenges raised (e.g., translation reliance, tokenization) highlight areas where Teuken could advance multilingual support beyond current models.
