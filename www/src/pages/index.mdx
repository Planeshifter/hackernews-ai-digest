### Show HN: Prompt Engine – Auto pick LLMs based on your prompts

#### [Submission URL](https://jigsawstack.com/blog/jigsawstack-mixture-of-agents-moa-outperform-any-single-llm-and-reduce-cost-with-prompt-engine) | 86 points | by [yoeven](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yoeven) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42339302)

In a bid to enhance the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of applications leveraging large language models (LLMs), JigsawStack has launched the Mixture-Of-Agents (MoA) framework, powered by their innovative Prompt Engine. Recognizing that not all LLMs excel in every domain—like GPT-4o's prowess in customer support versus Claude 3.5's strength in coding tasks—the MoA approach combines the capabilities of multiple models to deliver superior performance.

The Prompt Engine simplifies the often cumbersome process of managing multiple LLMs by automating prompt creation and execution. Developers need only define a solid prompt and desired output structure; the engine explores the best-fitting LLMs from a pool of over 50 options, intelligently grouping the top contenders for the task at hand. This not only enhances response accuracy but also helps reduce costs through efficient token usage and prompt caching.

When it’s time to run the engine, a ranking model assesses the outputs from the selected LLMs and delivers the best results in a consolidated format. With continuous learning capabilities, the framework adapts to improve quality over time, minimizing issues like hallucinations while trimming down redundant models for faster outputs. 

Moreover, JigsawStack ensures that developers can seamlessly upgrade to newer models without disrupting existing code through backward compatibility. The community is encouraged to join JigsawStack’s Discord and Twitter for collaboration and support. This innovative solution not only streamlines LLM deployment but also marks a significant leap in the quest for optimal language model orchestration.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding JigsawStack's Mixture-Of-Agents (MoA) framework primarily revolves around the framework's capability to enhance language model performance through prompt optimization and model selection. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Model Selection and Performance**: Users debated the effectiveness of switching between different models based on specific tasks. It's acknowledged that different models, like GPT-4o and Claude, have varying strengths. Some comments highlight the challenge of dynamically switching models within practical applications.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: There were discussions about the role of the Prompt Engine in improving the accuracy of the responses by refining how prompts are structured. Users expressed interest in how the engine could prevent tokens from being wasted and improve overall performance.

3. **Quality Discrepancies**: Participants noted the subjective differences in output quality between smaller models and larger ones, suggesting that even slight changes in the model can lead to drastic variations in results.

4. **Practical Applications**: A few users shared their practical experiences regarding using LLMs for specific coding tasks, mentioning challenges like generating HTML pages or handling media processing with different APIs.

5. **Concerns Over Limitations**: Some comments included skepticism about the framework's capability, with particularly noteworthy consumer experiences about the models’ output not meeting expectations in certain cases.

Overall, while there is excitement around the potential of the MoA framework in optimizing prompts and selecting the right models, there are also concerns and discussions about model effectiveness, quality inconsistency, and practical application challenges.
