#### [Submission URL](https://johnnysswlab.com/a-story-of-a-very-large-loop-with-a-long-instruction-dependency-chain/) | 30 points | by [signa11](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=signa11) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39562194)

Johnny's Software Lab LLC delves into the intricate world of software performance. In a recent case study, they tackled a thorny performance issue involving a lengthy loop. Despite the loop being optimized with vector intrinsics, a high cycles per instruction (CPI) number hinted at underlying inefficiencies. Upon closer inspection, they uncovered a chain of instruction dependencies within the loop, dampening CPU performance.

To experiment with this scenario, a loop with a prolonged dependency chain but no loop-carried dependencies was constructed. By analyzing the impact of nested cosine calculations on CPI, they revealed a diminishing CPI trend as the dependency chain lengthened. Introducing interleaving as a solution to boost instruction level parallelism (ILP) proved effective but complex, raising concerns of register usage and code complexity.

Exploring an alternative approach, they employed loop fission to split the original loop into smaller segments, each handling a cosine calculation. This method, although not as efficient as interleaving, showed improvements in performance compared to the initial loop setup. By breaking down the loop into manageable chunks with temporary storage for intermediate results, the fissioned loop exhibited better performance outcomes.
