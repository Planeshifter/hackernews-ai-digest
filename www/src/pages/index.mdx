### Transformers from Scratch

#### [Submission URL](https://e2eml.school/transformers.html) | 341 points | by [jasim](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasim) | [28 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35697627)

Transformers are all about sequence transduction, we need a way to convert words to numbers so we can do math on them. One approach is to count each word from one and assign it a number, but there's an easier format for computers to work with: one-hot encoding. This assigns each word an array of mostly zeroes with a single one in its corresponding index. This allows us to compute dot products and is used in matrix multiplication, a way to combine two-dimensional arrays. Markov chains, represented as matrices, can be used as a first order model to show what the next word is likely to be based on recent words.

The submission discusses the use of one-hot encoding to convert words to numbers for mathematical operations. It is suggested that the use of matrices, such as Markov chains, can help predict the next likely word based on the sequence. The comments provide links to additional resources, such as Jay Alammar's Illustrated Transformer series and TensorFlow implementation, and discuss various aspects of tokenization, embeddings, and projections. Some users express disappointment in the complexity of the topic while others provide beginner-friendly resources for understanding it. Two comments are flagged as possibly inappropriate.
