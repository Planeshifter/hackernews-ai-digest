In a revealing study, researchers have uncovered that more than half of long-form posts on LinkedIn are likely generated by AI, particularly since the launch of ChatGPT in late 2022. The analysis shows a staggering 189% increase in AI use on the platform, highlighting its growing influence in content creation. By October 2024, it was found that 54% of long-form LinkedIn posts were AI-generated, a remarkable shift from pre-ChatGPT times when AI usage was minimal. Additionally, the average word count of these posts has surged by 107%, reflecting a deepening reliance on AI tools for content creation.

This trend raises questions about the authenticity of thought leadership on LinkedIn, as users increasingly leverage AI for drafting impressive posts while often not disclosing this usage. The study analyzed nearly 9,000 posts over 82 months, reinforcing the notion that AI has become a dominant force in shaping the nature of professional discourse on the platform. As AI-generated content becomes the norm, the landscape of professional networking and expertise sharing is undeniably changing, prompting a need for users to discern between human-written and AI-generated material.

The discussion on the study revealing the extensive use of AI-generated content on LinkedIn, particularly in long-form posts, elicited a variety of responses from users. 

1. **Authenticity Concerns**: Many commenters raised concerns over the authenticity of LinkedIn content, questioning how much thought leadership is genuinely human-generated. There were comments emphasizing that AI-generated posts may lack personal insight and depth, with one user humorously commenting on the "comfort" of this reality.

2. **Content Length**: The significant increase in post length (107%) since the introduction of ChatGPT was noted, suggesting that longer, more elaborate posts could be the result of AI assistance rather than human effort.

3. **Skepticism about AI Detection**: Some users mentioned the challenges of accurately detecting AI-generated content, expressing skepticism about various AI detection tools, with one claiming these may mislead users regarding the authenticity of posts.

4. **Behavioral Shifts**: Users observed that professional networking behaviors have changed as a result of AI, with a general shift toward less meaningful content that is sometimes more focused on impressing others rather than sharing valuable insights.

5. **Impact on Engagement**: There was a recognition that while AI enables content generation, it might lead to a dilution of genuine engagement on the platform. Users reflected on how the shift may impact the quality of discourse and professional relationships.

Overall, the conversation highlighted a mix of humor, discomfort, and skepticism toward the implications of AI in professional networking, emphasizing the need for discerning content users on platforms like LinkedIn.
