#### [Submission URL](https://hotseatai.com) | 19 points | by [gkk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gkk) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37661458)

The proposed EU AI Act has generated a lot of questions and concerns, and Hotseat AI is here to provide answers. One of the questions asked is how the Act will impact higher education institutions in the US. According to the Act, US institutions using AI systems either within the EU or with outputs used in the EU will need to comply with the Act. The Act categorizes AI systems used in admissions processes or to assess students as high-risk, and these institutions will have to follow additional requirements. Non-compliance could result in penalties. In terms of data privacy, the AI Act builds upon existing EU data privacy regulations and extends them to AI systems. It emphasizes strong data governance and provides guidelines for transparency and safeguards when using personal data. Another question was about launching a free AI Act legal advice bot and what rules might be broken. The bot must disclose that it's an AI unless it's obvious, and users should be informed of AI functions, human oversight, and decision-making processes. Misclassifying the bot or launching it without approval can lead to fines. The bot should not influence public opinion on decisions like elections or impact public discourse on social media. User data should be anonymized and sensitive information protected when made public. The Euclidean algorithm does not qualify as an AI system under the EU AI Act because it doesn't operate autonomously or generate predictive outputs. Finally, the AI Act primarily targets EU member countries, but its scope extends to global providers and deployers of AI systems that are made available or intended for use within the EU. This means that all countries housing such providers or deployers will be impacted by the law.

The discussion on this submission includes several comments. 
- **gkk** mentions that they have discovered that Markdown formatting does not work well for long documents. They also suggest that there might be similar effects when it comes to using AI models for reasoning and performance assessments.

### CoRF: Colorizing Radiance Fields Using Knowledge Distillation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07668) | 59 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634018)

Researchers from the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition have developed a method called CoRF for colorizing radiance fields using knowledge distillation. Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods allow for high-quality novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, when applying image or video-based colorization methods to the generated grayscale novel views, artifacts due to inconsistency across views can occur. The researchers propose a distillation-based method that transfers color knowledge from existing 2D colorization methods to the radiance field network. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior colorized novel views while maintaining cross-view consistency. The method is also effective for colorizing radiance field networks trained from infrared (IR) multi-view images and old grayscale multi-view image sequences. This research has significant implications for improving the quality and consistency of synthesized images in computer vision applications.

The discussion revolves around the topic of knowledge distillation in computer vision and the proposed method for colorizing radiance fields.

### Mercenary mayhem: A technical analysis of Intellexa's PREDATOR spyware

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.talosintelligence.com/mercenary-intellexa-predator/) | 24 points | by [DerekBickerton](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=DerekBickerton) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634194)

Cisco Talos has conducted a technical analysis of Intellexa's PREDATOR spyware, a commercial spyware product sold by the firm. The research focuses on two components of the mobile spyware suite, ALIEN and PREDATOR, which work together to bypass security features on Android operating systems. The analysis reveals the interweaving of capabilities between ALIEN and PREDATOR, showing that ALIEN is more than just a loader for PREDATOR. The research also highlights the increasing use of commercial spyware by threat actors and the ethical and legal concerns surrounding their misuse. The Biden-Harris administration has signed an Executive Order prohibiting the US government from using commercial spyware that poses national security risks or has been misused by foreign actors.

The discussion on the submission begins with a user named LinuxBender commenting that the spyware probably uses locally blacklisted Indicators of Compromise (IoC) domains on a local DNS resolver. However, they note that this won't help people using public DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) servers. Another user, gnrms, adds that they searched for the domains mentioned and found multiple feeds that block these domains, including Cloudflare's 1112 blocking domains.

Another user, DerekBickerton, chimes in and suggests that in addition to blocking IoC domains, blocking IoC raw IPs would also be helpful, but they note that this can be difficult as IPv4 addresses change hands over time.

LinuxBender responds to DerekBickerton's comment and agrees, mentioning that looking for Autonomous System Numbers (AS#) like 12 for blocking Content Delivery Network (CDN) applications can be risky. They add that it can be time-consuming but can still be done, sharing two links related to this topic.

Overall, the discussion focuses on the technical aspects of blocking the spyware and the challenges involved in effectively blocking both domains and IP addresses associated with it.
