Simon Willison’s latest blog post dives into the misconception surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT regarding how "training" works. One common concern is users hesitating to interact with these tools out of fear of contributing to their training data. However, it's important to understand that LLMs, including ChatGPT, do not directly learn and memorize everything you say to them. They operate as stateless functions, treating each conversation as a separate entity without carrying forward memories from previous interactions.

Willison explains that starting a new chat conversation is akin to wiping the model's short-term memory clean, ensuring that each chat session is independent. Therefore, efforts to "train" the model by providing additional information during interactions are futile as the model resets with each new conversation. The concept of "context length" becomes crucial, dictating how much of the conversation the model can consider at a given time.

The idea of "training" in the realm of LLMs refers to the initial process of building these models through massive datasets, including vast amounts of text from various sources like Wikipedia, web scrapping, books, and more. It involves exhaustive pre-training to identify patterns in language and subsequent phases to refine the model's conversational abilities. Once trained, the model remains static, only occasionally undergoing updates that are distributed uniformly across servers.

Despite assurances that LLMs like ChatGPT do not directly train on user input, concerns about data usage persist due to vague terms and conditions allowing model improvements based on user interactions. The complexity lies in deciphering how providers utilize user data for enhancing their models, raising questions about data privacy and security.
