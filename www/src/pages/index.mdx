#### [Submission URL](https://vlmsareblind.github.io/) | 413 points | by [taesiri](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=taesiri) | [170 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40926734)

A recent study by researchers from Auburn University and the University of Alberta reveals that cutting-edge Vision Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini-1.5 Pro, which excel at image-text tasks, struggle with basic visual tasks like counting line intersections and identifying overlapping circles. The VLMs performed poorly on tasks that seemed easy for humans, indicating that their visual capabilities might be akin to a person with myopia or even an intelligent blind person making educated guesses.

In one task, the VLMs were asked to count the number of intersections between two 2-segment linear functions on diagrams, and the models showed subpar performance. Another task involved determining if two circles were overlapping or touching, with the VLMs exhibiting inconsistent results, especially at smaller distances. Additionally, the study explored the VLMs' ability to identify specific letters circled within words, showing varying degrees of accuracy across different models.

Despite their success in many language-related challenges, the study highlights the limitations of VLMs in visual perception tasks that are fundamental for human vision. The findings prompt further investigation into improving the visual understanding capabilities of these advanced language models.

After scrutiny, TUAW changed some author names to generic ones but stayed mum on AI use. Yahoo, which owns Engadget, the original TUAW archive, remained silent too.

The discussion revolves around the controversial re-launch of The Unofficial Apple Weblog (TUAW) and the suspicions surrounding AI-generated content bearing old writers' bylines. 

- al_borland finds it interesting that TUAW's content seems missing or materialized strangely, expressing concern over the source's credibility and the shutdown that occurred years ago.
- MBCook believes that the submitted article may be a joke, pointing out that some papers reportedly had their names swapped, and questioning the validity of the writers' posts being rewritten by AI. They mention Christina Warren's involvement.
- flmgrlcw mentions that Christina Warren appears to have noticed various discrepancies in the archive of TUAW, such as headlines being altered and random writer names assigned. They criticize the AI rewriting, assuming the tactic was used for profit by manipulating search engines, although they acknowledge the tricky legal enforcement involved in changing bylines. The commenter appreciates other tech publications like iLounge quickly reacting to similar issues in the past. They express gratitude for the media outlets that handled the situation with transparency and mention Yahoo's ownership.
- RecycledEle wishes for accurate reports on web content monitoring to address issues of recycled and ranked search engine results.
