#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/aymenfurter/microagents) | 214 points | by [gourmetcode](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gourmetcode) | [75 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38679453)

A GitHub repository called "microagents" has caught the attention of the Hacker News community. The repository contains a project that explores the concept of self-evolving agents capable of generating and improving themselves. These agents can automatically generate Python code prompts tailored to provide answers to user queries.
The process starts with a user query, which activates a basic "bootstrap" agent. The bootstrap agent plans and delegates tasks to specialized agents capable of running Python code for broader functions. An Agent Manager oversees these agents, selecting or creating them based on vector similarity. The agents have evolving system prompts that improve through learning.
The repository showcases two synthesized agent prompts: "CalculateAddition Agent" and "GetPopulationOfCountry Agent." The CalculateAddition Agent is an arithmetic solver that can calculate the sum of two numbers. The GetPopulationOfCountry Agent is a data extractor that retrieves the population of a given country using a provided Python code snippet.
The project faces certain challenges and potential improvements. Path optimization is needed to effectively discard non-functional agents. Performance and parallelization could be enhanced by implementing parallel processing for prompt evolutions. A refined strategy for prompt evolution, which quantifies the success ratio, would improve the system. Integrating persistent agent prompts with vector databases and sharing successful agents across runtime environments can improve efficiency. Implementing a hierarchical agent structure for managing requests could also lead to major improvements.
