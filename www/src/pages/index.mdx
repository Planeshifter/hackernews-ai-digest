### Markov chains are funnier than LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://emnudge.dev/blog/markov-chains-are-funny/) | 424 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [192 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41286203)

In an intriguing exploration of humor and artificial intelligence, a recent article posits that Markov chains – the basic building blocks of predictive text – can actually generate funnier outputs than large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. By contrasting the two, the author illustrates how Markov chains, despite being simpler and less sophisticated, can create unexpected and thus humorous results.

The article begins with an example where a Markov chain produces a nonsensical yet amusing sentence by mixing language from the King James Bible and computer science, while ChatGPT generates a more coherent but ultimately less surprising sentence. This leads to the thesis that humor hinges on "unserious surprise," which is often achieved by violating expectations, something Markov chains can do by their unpredictable nature.

As the author delves deeper into the mechanics of humor, they define it as rooted in the element of surprise—highlighting that jokes that deviate from expected patterns tend to elicit more laughter. In contrast, LLMs, which rely heavily on context and statistical probability to generate text, often produce "soulless" outputs that lack creativity and spontaneity. They essentially generate the "most average" response rather than something original or surprising.

Ultimately, the article champions the idea that humor can be quantitatively assessed, making a case for the charm of randomness in Markov chains, and how their erratic outputs can spark genuine laughter in ways that LLMs may struggle to capture. The piece invites readers to reconsider the nature of comedy in the age of advanced AI, suggesting that sometimes, the simplest tools can lead to the most delightful surprises.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the humorous comparison between Markov chains and large language models (LLMs) in generating funny content. Several users reflect on experiences where they found Markov-generated text amusing due to its absurdity and unpredictability, particularly noting that while Markov chains can produce entertaining nonsense, LLMs often yield more coherent but less surprising outputs. One commenter recounts their use of a Markov generator for blog posts, likening its results to "word soup," yet finds them more delightful compared to standard LLM-generated content that tends to lack flair.

Many comments touch on the theme that humor relies on unexpected twists, with Markov chains meeting this criterion effectively through randomness. Others discuss their historical use of Markov generators in chat contexts, emphasizing the distinctive and unpredictable flavor of the text they produce. A notable dialogue compares specific examples of humor, with user-created jokes highlighting the differences between the two approaches to humor.

Some users analyze the evolving conversation around AI in humor, pointing out the necessity for machines to balance randomness with coherence. They suggest that while LLMs aim to create sensible responses, they often miss out on the delightful absurdities that simpler algorithms like Markov chains can provide. Several participants convey a sense of nostalgia and appreciation for the charm of earlier text-generation techniques, suggesting that there may still be value in the chaotic creativity of Markov models over the polished outputs of contemporary LLMs.
