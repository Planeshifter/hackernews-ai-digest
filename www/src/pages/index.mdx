### Does the success of LLM support Wittgenstein's position that "meaning is use"?

#### [Submission URL](https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/112021/does-the-success-of-ai-large-language-models-support-wittgensteins-position-t) | 37 points | by [IdealeZahlen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=IdealeZahlen) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41140263)

A thought-provoking discussion has emerged on Hacker News regarding whether the success of AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), supports philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein's claim that "meaning is use." The debate centers on whether the coherent and contextually relevant text generated by LLMs truly encapsulates meaning, as Wittgenstein posited that the meaning of a word is intrinsically linked to its contextual usage in language.

Several commenters weigh in, highlighting that while LLMs can produce language that appears meaningful due to their extensive training on diverse textual data, they lack true consciousness or an intrinsic understanding of the concepts they manipulate. One insightful perspective suggests that LLMs serve as intermediaries between human authors and users, utilizing learned contexts to create coherent language without genuine comprehension. Others contend that this raises questions about the authenticity of the 'meaning' produced since there's no underlying awareness or intent behind it.

In contrast, some participants argue that LLMs, when studied in the context of games or tasks like chess, exhibit a form of knowing through their ability to generate strategies and respond to inputs as if they understand a game board's layout. This introduces an intriguing challenge to the notion that linguistic ability alone guarantees a grasp of meaning.

The conversation not only delves into the philosophy of language but also reflects broader implications for AI's role in our understanding of communication, meaning, and intelligence. The discourse captures the complexity of defining meaning in the context of artificial intelligence, inviting further exploration into the fundamental nature of language and understanding.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the philosophical implications of AI's capability to generate language, specifically in relation to Ludwig Wittgenstein's assertion that "meaning is use." One commenter initiates the conversation by referencing how Large Language Models (LLMs) generate contextually relevant text but do not truly understand the meanings behind the words they produce.

Several participants provide varied perspectives, with some arguing that LLMs act as conduits that generate coherent language through learned patterns without real comprehension. This raises questions about the authenticity of the meaning produced by these models, as there is no underlying intent or awareness.

Others bring fascinating examples into the discussion, such as LLMs’ performance in games like chess, suggesting they exhibit a different form of "knowing" by responding adeptly to game strategies, which challenges conventional definitions of understanding. This duality points to the complexities of language and meaning in the context of AI, igniting a broader inquiry into how LLMs intersect with philosophical theories of meaning, interpretation, and cognition.

Furthermore, some commenters reflect on the limitations and capabilities of LLMs compared to human language comprehension, while others discuss the concept of statistical language processing as a potential way to understand AI models effectively. Overall, the discourse highlights a rich examination of the philosophical implications concerning communication, intelligence, and the essence of meaning in artificial intelligence.
