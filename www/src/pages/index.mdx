### AI-designed chips are so weird that 'humans cannot understand them'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/humans-cannot-really-understand-them-weird-ai-designed-chip-is-unlike-any-other-made-by-humans-and-performs-much-better) | 303 points | by [anonymousiam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anonymousiam) | [210 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43152407)

In a groundbreaking advancement, engineers at Princeton University and the Indian Institute of Technology have unveiled how artificial intelligence can revolutionize the design of complex millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) wireless chips, a process that previously took weeks, now accomplished in mere hours. These chips, pivotal for technologies like 5G modem in smartphones, pose enormous challenges, demanding innovation in miniaturization and functionality.

Unlike traditional methods that rely heavily on human intuition and repetitive trial-and-error optimization, the AI adopts an inverse design approach. It begins with the end goal in mind and independently determines necessary inputs and parameters. This paradigm shift allows the AI to treat each chip as a cohesive singular entity rather than a fragmented collection of components, bypassing old templates that often harbor inefficiencies.

Excitingly, the AI-produced chip designs delivered superior performance, exceeding those crafted by human designers. However, these AI-generated designs are unconventional, described by lead researcher Kaushik Sengupta as "look(ing) randomly shaped"—a creativity difficult for humans to grasp. While promising, the approach isn't without its pitfalls; some AI designs were errant, akin to "hallucinations" seen in other generative AI outputs, underscoring the ongoing need for human oversight.

Sengupta emphasizes that the vision isn’t about replacing human ingenuity but enhancing it. The rapid prototyping capabilities introduced by AI-driven design open doors to tailored chip specifications, optimizing for energy efficiency or expanding frequency ranges.

The research signifies just a glimpse of potential future applications across electronic design, promising to transform how we innovate in tech-heavy fields. This development might just be setting the stage for a new era in chip design, with AI as a crucial ally.

### It is no longer safe to move our governments and societies to US clouds

#### [Submission URL](https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/you-can-no-longer-base-your-government-and-society-on-us-clouds/) | 1270 points | by [Sami_Lehtinen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Sami_Lehtinen) | [737 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43150085)

A thought-provoking post raises a critical issue facing European societies: the growing dependence on American cloud services to manage their governmental and societal functions. The author argues that it is imprudent for European nations to transfer control of their data to the U.S., especially considering the unpredictable political climate influenced by figures like Donald Trump. The post critiques the Dutch government's reliance on American tech giants, citing a recent letter that absurdly claims certain data transfers don't expose sensitive information to American eyes. This, the author asserts, is a dangerously naïve stance, further complicated by the invalidation of the legal frameworks previously used to justify these data exchanges.

The piece explores the comfort trap many find themselves in—choosing convenience over sovereignty because American software, like MS Teams and Outlook, is familiar and seemingly easier to use. But this reliance on US tech raises significant concerns about data privacy and national security, especially considering potential political manipulations from across the Atlantic. The author calls for European governments to bravely invest in developing or adopting alternative technologies, desiring a future not tethered to American interests, for their own sake and the sake of innovation in the tech sector.

Ultimately, the post is a call to action for Europe to reclaim control over its digital infrastructure, urging bold steps towards diversification and sovereignty. If these issues resonate with you, consider subscribing to the author's newsletter for more insights.

The discussion revolves around Europe's dependency on American cloud services and the challenges of achieving digital sovereignty. Key points include:

1. **Critique of Inaction**: Initially, participants criticize European governments for ignoring long-standing warnings about over-reliance on U.S. tech giants like AWS and Azure. Costs to transition away are estimated at 100-1000x higher today, with economic, military, and cultural sovereignty at risk.

2. **Technical Barriers**: Migrating to EU-based solutions (e.g., Scaleway, OVH, OpenStack) is deemed possible but fraught with challenges. Proprietary APIs (e.g., AWS Lambda) and complex networking stacks create vendor lock-in. Open-source alternatives like OpenStack exist but require significant investment and expertise, with some dismissing them as underdocumented or user-unfriendly compared to U.S. cloud providers.

3. **EU Cloud Providers**: Scaleway, Hetzner, and OpenTelekom Cloud are highlighted as European alternatives, though users report mixed experiences—praised for local infrastructure but criticized for reliability and billing issues. OpenStack-based solutions are noted but face adoption hurdles due to fragmentation and poor market presence.

4. **Infrastructure Solutions**: Some suggest building independent EU data centers using open standards (e.g., Kubernetes, OpenFaaS) to avoid lock-in. Others emphasize the need for political investment and subsidies to scale homegrown cloud ecosystems, though sourcing non-U.S./Chinese hardware (e.g., chips) remains a challenge.

5. **Call to Action**: The consensus is that Europe must prioritize long-term sovereignty over short-term convenience, despite the steep costs. Decentralized, open-source tools and support for local providers are seen as critical steps, but political will and pan-EU collaboration are lacking.

### Strategic Wealth Accumulation Under Transformative AI Expectations

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11264) | 92 points | by [jandrewrogers](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jandrewrogers) | [143 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43136428)

In a groundbreaking paper recently submitted to arXiv, economist Caleb Maresca dives into the future-altering implications of Transformative AI (TAI) on wealth accumulation and interest rates. Maresca's research suggests that anticipation of TAI could drastically shift economic behavior even before the technology fully emerges. By examining a model where income from automated labor shifts from workers to AI controllers, Maresca foresees a world where wealth heavily influences who benefits from AI, causing interest rates to surge significantly—rising to an expected 10-16% compared to a typical 3% without these dynamics. This leap in rates, driven by strategic wealth positioning, points to serious consequences for economic policy and financial stability. The paper signals a need for a deep reevaluation of monetary strategies in the face of impending technological advancements. Expect economic discussions to heat up as the potential of TAI continues to loom large on the horizon.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on TAI and Economic Implications:**

The discussion revolves around Caleb Maresca’s paper suggesting that anticipatory shifts in investment behavior, driven by Transformative AI (TAI), could destabilize markets and spike interest rates. Key themes from the comments include:

1. **Investment Shifts and Market Fallout**:  
   - Users debate whether investors, foreseeing AI-driven market disruptions, will abandon pre-AI assets (e.g., bonds) in favor of AI-related stocks, potentially rendering traditional investments "worthless." Others draw parallels to historical bubbles (e.g., the internet boom), where overhyped expectations led to misallocation of capital.  
   - Skepticism arises about the paper’s assumption of perfect investor rationality, with some arguing diversification strategies (like those seen in the 20th-century oil industry) might mitigate drastic market crashes.  

2. **Labor vs. Capital Returns**:  
   - The paper’s claim that TAI shifts returns from labor to capital sparks debate. While some agree this concentrates wealth, others counter that productivity gains from AI could lower service costs (e.g., legal fees) for consumers. Critics note, however, that reduced prices depend on competition—corporate monopolies might pocket savings instead.  

3. **B2B vs. Consumer Markets**:  
   - A thread questions the paper’s focus on consumer markets, arguing B2B transactions (e.g., government contracts, corporate services) dominate economic activity. This raises concerns about AI deepening corporate control while governments shrink, leaving consumers vulnerable.  

4. **Legal and Regulatory Implications**:  
   - Discussions question whether AI could replace lawyers (e.g., $500 AI-generated documents vs. human attorneys), though some argue complexity and regulatory oversight will limit this. Others foresee insurance and liability challenges for AI-chartered entities.  

5. **Political and Societal Impacts**:  
   - Critics suggest the paper overlooks political interventions (e.g., heavy taxation of AI assets) or systemic shifts like “cybernetic socialism” that might redistribute AI’s benefits. Pessimists warn of mass impoverishment if AI benefits accrue only to owners, while optimists highlight AI’s potential to solve global challenges (climate change, poverty).  

6. **Skepticism About Assumptions**:  
   - Many challenge the paper’s model for assuming zero-sum labor replacement and a frictionless market. Real-world dynamics—corporate greed, lobbying, monopolistic tendencies—could distort outcomes, leading to concentration of power instead of broad consumer gains.  

**Conclusion**:  
The comments reflect polarized views: some see TAI as a force for economic democratization, while others predict entrenched inequality. Debates center on whether competition, regulation, or political action will shape AI’s economic impact, with historical parallels and sector-specific analyses (e.g., legal, B2B) adding nuance. A recurring theme is the tension between theoretical models and real-world market/political imperfections.

### Who needs a sneaker bot when AI can hallucinate a win for you?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.eql.com/media/sneaker-bot-ai-error) | 167 points | by [pdonelan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pdonelan) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43135382)

Every year, the NBA All-Star Weekend is a hotbed of excitement for sneaker enthusiasts as brands like Jordan launch highly anticipated shoes. However, this year’s release marking the 40th anniversary of Michael Jordan's iconic debut shoe came with unexpected drama. EQL, a platform facilitating sneaker launches, faced a peculiar problem: some users were receiving misleading "you've won" email notifications, only to find a "SORRY" message upon further inspection. 

This confusing situation, reminiscent of Schrödinger’s paradox, wasn’t due to bugs on EQL's part but rather an unexpected issue with Yahoo Mail. The email client’s recently introduced AI feature was generating misleading summaries, causing users to prematurely celebrate. The AI, presumably trained on past EQL email content, was hallucinating incorrect win notices without making it clear they were AI-generated, affecting numerous users reading their emails through Yahoo Mail.

Despite the bizarre setback, EQL's team continues to support sneaker fans by ensuring accurate information is available directly through their app and support channels. Meanwhile, Yahoo’s feature remains a potential source of confusion beyond just sneaker releases—a problem EQL hopes will be addressed soon. Until then, they're doubling down on using technology to maintain fair launches and ensure real fans get the coveted kicks. If you're a sneaker enthusiast, you might want to double-check those win notifications and keep an eye on your email client’s latest features!

The Hacker News discussion around Yahoo Mail's AI-generated email summaries causing confusion during an NBA sneaker launch reveals several critical themes:

1. **Criticism of AI Trustworthiness**: Users expressed frustration with the blind trust placed in AI systems like LLMs for critical communications. The incident underscored how AI-generated summaries—trained on past emails—can hallucinate misleading information (e.g., false "you've won" notifications), eroding user confidence. Comparisons were drawn to Nigerian Prince scams, emphasizing the risks of probabilistic AI outputs replacing deterministic systems.

2. **Technical Missteps**: Commenters pointed out potential flaws in how email content is parsed. For example, if emails use plaintext fallbacks instead of structured HTML, AI might misread or mishandle the content (e.g., misinterpreting "SORRY" as a win). This technical oversight highlights the need for rigorous testing of how AI interacts with existing email formats.

3. **Accountability Gaps**: Concerns arose about companies increasingly replacing human roles (customer support, legal departments) with unaccountable AI systems. A BBC article was cited, noting cases where LLM-powered chatbots provided harmful advice, leaving users without recourse. Critics argued that AI’s probabilistic nature makes it unsuitable for high-stakes tasks requiring 100% accuracy.

4. **Skepticism of AI's Evolution**: Debates emerged around whether scaling AI models (e.g., trillion parameters) could improve reliability. Critics countered that LLMs are fundamentally unreliable, likening them to error-prone hardware (SSDs, RAM) and stressing that more parameters won’t resolve inherent flaws. Some advocated for localized, smaller models instead of massive, opaque systems.

5. **Broader Tech Industry Trends**: The incident was seen as emblematic of rushed AI integrations, with companies prioritizing hype over usability. Comparisons included failed tech features like Apple’s Ping, with warnings that AI’s “99% success rate” still fails catastrophically for critical use cases. Commenters criticized Silicon Valley’s tendency to deploy AI without fully anticipating real-world consequences.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects a community deeply skeptical of current AI implementations, advocating for caution, transparency, and human oversight—especially in contexts where errors carry significant consequences. Trust in AI systems is fragile, and incidents like Yahoo’s misfiring summaries highlight the gap between technological aspiration and reliable execution.

### Sparse Voxels Rasterization: Real-Time High-Fidelity Radiance Field Rendering

#### [Submission URL](https://svraster.github.io/) | 104 points | by [jasondavies](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jasondavies) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43132964)

Get ready for a deep dive into the cutting-edge world of computer graphics! Researchers from Nvidia, Cornell University, and National Taiwan University have unveiled a groundbreaking algorithm in radiance field rendering, dubbed "Sparse Voxels Rasterization" (SVRaster), which promises technological advancements without the reliance on neural networks. 

The core innovation of SVRaster lies in its ability to efficiently render images using adaptive sparse voxels combined with a customized rasterization process. Unlike traditional methods, it bypasses Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points, instead directly leveraging multi-view images to optimize real-time rendering. The technique explores new frontiers by delivering high-fidelity visuals at an astonishingly fast rate of over 100 frames per second, while maintaining a lofty 655,363 grid resolution.

Key contributions include the introduction of an adaptive voxel allocation that expertly captures scene details at various levels, ensuring vivid image reconstruction. Notably, it employs ray direction-dependent Morton ordering, preventing the notorious "popping" artifact typical of Gaussian-based techniques. This approach not only sets a new benchmark in rendering quality, boosting PSNR by over 4 dB, but also dramatically speeds up frame rates by more than tenfold compared to previous models.

The new representation is a versatile hybrid, merging primitive and volumetric models under an Octree structure specifically designed for efficiency. The pioneering system integrates seamlessly with existing 3D processing methods like Volume Fusion and Voxel Pooling, opening doors to a plethora of new applications.

But it doesn’t stop there! The team showcases remarkable outcomes in novel-view synthesis, demonstrating the simultaneous fusion of 2D modalities into sparse voxels. These feats enable precise image segmentation and enhance semantic rendering through advanced techniques like Segformer and RADIOv2.5, paving the way for even more sophisticated visual experiences.

For all the graphics aficionados out there, the full potential of SVRaster can be explored further through interactive examples provided in Jupyter notebooks. This is not just a leap forward but a sprint in rendering technology, setting the stage for exciting developments in the realm of 3D visualization. Stay tuned as SVRaster leads the charge towards more immersive and efficient real-time graphics rendering!

Some express excitement about bypassing NeRF’s computationally expensive ray-marching and MLP evaluations, though others joke about the irony of "throwing neural networks at everything" in modern research.

2. **Gaussian Splatting vs. Sparse Voxels:**  
   Debate surfaces over whether SVRaster’s voxel-based approach is fundamentally different from Gaussian splatting techniques. One user suggests it resembles "Gaussian splatting with cubes" instead of Gaussians, achieving similar quality and speed. Others criticize traditional Gaussian methods for artifacts like "popping," which SVRaster mitigates via Morton ordering.

3. **Efficiency Gains:**  
   The paper’s claimed speed (>100 FPS) and resolution (655k grid) impress users, with some calling it a "straightforward efficiency improvement" over predecessors like Plenoxels. However, skeptics question whether gains stem more from clever voxel allocation strategies than algorithmic breakthroughs.

4. **Input Requirements & Practicality:**  
   Questions arise about input data needs (e.g., camera parameters, number of images). Users compare it to photogrammetry and note the challenge of acquiring high-quality multi-view data for real-world applications. One commenter mentions MIP-NeRF 360’s reliance on high-grade positional data, wondering how SVRaster’s approach scales.

5. **Technical Curiosity:**  
   Users praise the integration with 3D processing pipelines (e.g., Volume Fusion) and inquire about hybridizing primitive/volumetric models under Octree structures. Some highlight the Jupyter notebook demos as valuable for experimentation.

6. **Skepticism & Humor:**  
   A playful tone emerges, with users riffing on terms like "reverse-rendering" and questioning whether the method is "just fancy point clouds."

Here’s a concise summary of the discussion:

### Key Debate: Reasoning Capabilities of LLMs  
1. **Skepticism of LLM Reasoning**  
   - Users argue LLMs cannot inherently "reason" like humans but instead mimic patterns from training data. For example, solving math problems (e.g., **AIME 2025**-style challenges) relies on reproducing solutions from their training corpus rather than genuine logical deduction.  
   - Critiques highlight that LLMs often generate "statistical approximations" of reasoning rather than structured logic or understanding of definitions (e.g., failing transitive property tests).  

2. **Dataset Quality and Verification**  
   - Criticisms address the quality of datasets (e.g., ambiguous physics/math problems, lack of clear answers) and unreliable verification methods for LLM outputs.  
   - A developer (**rosstaylor90**) acknowledges these issues and mentions ongoing efforts to improve data filtering, reinforcement learning (RL), and transparency.  

3. **Philosophical Divide**  
   - Some users (**emorning3**, **perching_aix**) dismiss LLMs’ capacity for reason, arguing their outputs are "meaningless rearrangements" of text. Others counter that humans also rely on pattern recognition (e.g., mental math), blurring the line between "true reasoning" and statistical processes.  
   - Debates arise over what defines reasoning: Is it logical proofs (*formal definitions*) or task performance (*correct answers*), even if via "stochastic parrot"-like methods?  

4. **AIME as a Test Case**  
   - The **AIME competition** (closed-book math exam) is cited as a benchmark. While LLMs can solve problems reproduced in their training data, critics question whether this demonstrates reasoning or memorization.  

5. **Technical Counterarguments**  
   - Supporters note that LLMs exhibit problem-solving "fluency" in tasks like code generation or math proofs, even if their approach differs from humans.  
   - **CamperBob2** underscores that LLMs remain **next-token predictors**, limited by their architecture.  

### Conclusion  
The discussion reflects a tension between dismissing LLMs as statistical mimics and acknowledging their practical utility. Skeptics demand stricter definitions of reasoning (e.g., formal logic), while proponents emphasize performance on complex tasks, even if achieved through unconventional methods. The debate remains unresolved, hinging on philosophical distinctions between process and outcome.
