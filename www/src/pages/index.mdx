In a recent operation to take down a major component of the cybercrime ecosystem, the FBI remotely installed software on over 700,000 computers around the world without notifying the victims. The operation was authorized by a court warrant and aimed to disrupt a botnet known as Qakbot. While disrupting botnets is generally seen as a public good, concerns arise about the potential invasion of privacy and abuse of power. The warrant allowed the FBI to search and seize information from any computer it sent its software to. It is unclear how the FBI determined which computers were infected, as the warrant seems to authorize an intrusion into all accessible computers. The only limitation mentioned in the warrant is that it does not authorize the seizure of any tangible property or alteration of functionality. This operation raises questions about the extent to which the government can coerce content moderation decisions and the means by which it can do so.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the recent operation conducted by the FBI to take down the Qakbot botnet. Users express concerns about the potential invasion of privacy and abuse of power that could result from the FBI remotely installing software on over 700,000 computers without notifying the victims.

Today's article on Sebastian Raschka's blog explores the process of Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) in the context of training Language Models (LLMs). RLHF is an important component of modern LLM training as it allows for the incorporation of human preferences into the optimization process, leading to improved model performance and safety.

The article provides a step-by-step breakdown of RLHF, starting with a discussion of the canonical LLM training pipeline. This pipeline consists of three main steps: pretraining, supervised finetuning, and alignment. In the pretraining phase, models learn from vast unlabeled text datasets using a next-word prediction task. This allows for the leveraging of large, unlabeled datasets without the need for manual labeling.

The next step is supervised finetuning, where models are trained on instruction-output pairs. This involves predicting the next tokens in the output given specific instructions. Supervised finetuning requires smaller datasets compared to pretraining, as it involves human or high-quality LLM-generated instructions and desired outputs.

Finally, the article delves into the RLHF-based alignment step, which aims to align the LLM with human preferences. RLHF involves fine-tuning the model using reinforcement learning, where human feedback is used to guide and improve the model's responses. The article also provides a comparison between ChatGPT's and Llama 2's implementations of RLHF.

For those interested in alternatives to RLHF, the article includes a section that highlights the most recent alternatives and intends to keep it regularly updated.

Overall, the article offers a comprehensive overview of RLHF and its role in LLM training, providing insights into its importance and practical implementations.

The discussion on the submission revolves around various aspects of RLHF and its implications for language models. Here are some key points raised by the commenters:

- Discussions on the alignment process of LLMs highlight the challenges related to the quality and quantity of training data. The commenter "og_kalu" points out that producing good supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets can be quite challenging, while "phllpcrtr" emphasizes the high degree of reliability and reproducibility needed in LLMs, which may not be achieved easily.
- "wstrnr" suggests the addition of additional layers in LLMs to determine the relevance and logical soundness of presented conclusions, supporting the conclusions presented in the article.
- The issue of hallucination in language models is addressed by multiple commenters. "bgglbtl" states that the high degree of reliability and reproducibility in LLMs is crucial, and "Salgat" discusses the limitations of simple linear regression models in dealing with hallucinations and the need for more complex algorithms.
- "ftxbr" argues that large language models lack creativity and are limited in their cognitive capabilities, while "Salgat" counters that hallucination is a part of creativity and that wrong predictions are an inherent flaw of creative language models.
- "ShamelessC" criticizes the article for subtly misrepresenting OpenAI's intention regarding RLHF's role in hallucination reduction, stating that it was partially flawed in its design and purpose.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.consumerreports.org/electronics/digital-assistants/voice-assistants-and-ad-targeting-a1098726954/) | 64 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460403)

Have you ever wondered if your interactions with voice assistants like Google Assistant and Alexa are being used for ad targeting? Well, a new study by Northeastern University in Boston has found evidence that Google and Amazon do indeed use your voice interactions to draw conclusions about you. Based on what you say to these devices, Google can infer details like your marital status and homeowner status, while Amazon takes note of products you may be interested in. These companies use this data to supplement the information they already gather from your phones and laptops, and in turn, marketers use this valuable information to target ads to the people they believe are most likely to buy their products. So the requests you make to Alexa or Google Assistant can actually influence the ads you see online. The study also revealed that Google Assistant's responses to you can be influenced by your past interactions. On the other hand, Apple's Siri does not appear to connect any tags directly to users or use voice interactions to build a marketing profile. This study highlights the need for better transparency in the data privacy practices of voice assistants. While you may be used to being tracked online, it's important to consider how your interactions with voice assistants may also be contributing to targeted advertising.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the implications of the study's findings and the differences between voice assistants. Some users are surprised by the extent to which Google and Amazon use voice interactions for targeted advertising, while others expect this level of personalization. Commenters point out that Google profits from targeted ads based on user searches, while Amazon builds marketing profiles from Alexa purchases. There is also a mention of Apple's Siri, which does not seem to use voice interactions for ad targeting, leading to a discussion on Siri's privacy practices. One commenter shares an anecdote about their family's experience with targeted ads on their iPhones, raising questions about IP-based targeting and privacy. Another commenter mentions that Siri uses location services. One user dismisses the idea of any conspiracy theories surrounding the study findings and emphasizes the predictability and relevance of targeted ads. However, it is noted that people may not fully understand the extent to which their interactions are being used. A final comment raises the question of whether Siri has a private API or if Apple has access to Siri's data.

In a thought-provoking paper, Madeleine Clare Elish explores the concept of "moral crumple zones" in human-robot interaction. Drawing on examples of high-profile accidents involving complex automated systems, the author argues that the responsibility for an action may be unfairly attributed to a human operator who has limited control over the behavior of an autonomous or automated system. 

Much like a crumple zone in a car absorbs the force of impact in a crash, the author describes the human operator in a complex and automated system as a "component" that bears the brunt of moral and legal responsibilities when the system malfunctions. This concept challenges the design and regulation of human-robot systems, highlighting the potential for consumer and worker harm in new complex technologies.

By examining cases such as accidents involving driverless cars and other autonomous technologies, the paper raises important questions about responsibility, ethics, and the social perceptions of technology. Understanding and addressing these moral crumple zones is crucial as the use of artificial intelligence and automation continues to expand in society.

Overall, Elish’s paper provides a valuable perspective on the complex relationship between humans and technology, emphasizing the need for responsible design and regulation in the development of autonomous systems.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the concept of assigning responsibility in cases of accidents involving autonomous or automated systems. One user points out that legal systems have already adapted to handle situations where crimes are committed by proxy through human agents, but questions whether it makes sense to attribute responsibility to AI systems. Another user raises concerns about the consequences of neglecting human responsibility and shifting liability to non-human entities. They argue that failure to hold companies accountable for the actions of AI systems could lead to negative outcomes. 

The discussion also touches upon the role of truck drivers and whether they can be blamed for accidents caused by AI systems. Some argue that truck drivers are being unfairly blamed for accidents caused by system malfunctions. Others point out that human drivers may react differently in dangerous situations and that AI malfunctions may not be fully preventable.

There is also a discussion about the power dynamics and politics involved in assigning responsibility for accidents caused by AI systems. One user suggests that the legal system allows courts to determine appropriate punishments based on circumstances, while another argues that the legal system is flawed and that personal background and limited experience are factors in decision-making. 

The conversation delves into the broader issues of employer demands and the consequences of violating laws. Some argue that employees are forced to comply with unsafe conditions and that companies should be held responsible. Others mention the power imbalance between employers and employees and the importance of protections for employees. 

There is also a brief discussion on the role of courts and the ability of defendants to control their actions, as well as a comment about the inability to assign blame to non-human entities.

Overall, the discussion highlights the complexities of assigning responsibility and the need to address ethical and legal considerations in human-robot interaction.

### Improving NeRF quality by progressive camera placement

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00014) | 33 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37460465)

A recent paper titled "Improving NeRF Quality by Progressive Camera Placement for Unrestricted Navigation in Complex Environments" explores how to enhance the quality of novel view synthesis using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in complex environments. NeRFs excel at object-centric reconstructions, but their performance in environments such as rooms and houses is often underwhelming. The researchers argue that high-quality data is crucial for optimizing a NeRF effectively, and propose an algorithm that suggests new camera placements to improve the visual quality of the reconstruction. Their solution outperforms existing methods and can be used with any NeRF model. This research has the potential to advance the field of computer vision and pattern recognition.

In the comments, user "brdknwls" suggests that capturing 3D video instead of stills and using optimal camera placement can capture more information. User "fudged71" wonders if Gaussian Splattering techniques and AR headsets could also be effective. "Legend2440" mentions that NeRFs work with Gaussian splatting and improving 3D representation. "PaulHoule" finds the research exciting and suggests that the field could benefit from incorporating light field cameras for creating 3D models. "blvscff" mentions a separate research paper on Gaussian splattering. "lucb1e" explains the role of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) in rendering 3D reconstructions and user "PaulHoule" agrees. "CharlesW" brings up a similar technique called Multi-View Stereo (MVS), and "blvscff" comments on the differentiable process of NeRFs.


ffstrf finds this interesting and speculates that it might be possible to leverage hacking services or replicate existing solutions that support machine learning.

The conversation ends without further comments.

Have you ever wanted an AI that speaks just like you? Well, now you can! A team from Carnegie Mellon University has forked the popular Llama-recipes repository and created WhatsApp-Llama, a tool that allows you to train a language model to replicate your personal texting style on WhatsApp.

By inputting your WhatsApp conversations, you can fine-tune the Llama-2 7b chat model to respond just like you do. The team used parameter efficient finetuning (QLoRA) and int4 quantization on a single GPU to achieve impressive results.

In their experiments, the fine-tuned Llama-2 model quickly picked up on the nuances of the user's texting style. The average number of words generated by the finetuned Llama-2 was 300% more than the vanilla Llama-2 model. The model accurately replicated common phrases and emoji usage.

To test the model's performance, the team conducted a Turing Test with friends. They asked their friends to ask three questions on WhatsApp and then responded with two candidate responses, one from themselves and one from the Llama-2 model. The friends had to guess which response was from the user and which one was from the AI. The model fooled 10% of the friends, with some of its responses being eerily similar to the user's own.

To get started with WhatsApp-Llama, you need to export your WhatsApp chats and preprocess the dataset. The detailed steps can be found in the README file of the repository. The team recommends exporting 10 WhatsApp chats from friends you frequently speak to, excluding media.

With WhatsApp-Llama, you can have an AI that speaks just like you on WhatsApp. This opens up possibilities for personalization and automation in text-based communication. So go ahead, unleash your AI clone and start chatting!

### Proofs based on diagonalization help reveal the limits of algorithms

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/alan-turing-and-the-power-of-negative-thinking-20230905/) | 81 points | by [nsoonhui](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nsoonhui) | [46 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37401228)

In a recent article on Quanta Magazine, Ben Brubaker explores the power of negative thinking in the work of legendary computer scientist Alan Turing. Turing pioneered the concept of "uncomputable" problems, which are problems that cannot be solved algorithmically. He proved the existence of such problems using a counterintuitive strategy based on a mathematical technique called diagonalization. Diagonalization involves building up a missing string bit by bit to ensure that it differs from every string on a given list. This approach plays well with infinity and has been used by mathematicians and computer scientists, including Turing, to prove various results. In Turing's case, he utilized diagonalization to construct an obstinate problem that would thwart every algorithm on an infinite list, demonstrating the existence of unsolvable problems. This contrarian approach to problem-solving has had a profound impact on the field of computer science and continues to inspire researchers today.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the concept of diagonalization and its application to proving the existence of uncomputable problems. Some commenters argue that the diagonalization argument used by Turing is not sufficient to prove the existence of uncomputable real numbers, while others provide counterarguments to support Turing's approach. There is also a discussion about constructive vs non-constructive mathematics and the limitations of diagonalization in a constructive framework. Overall, the discussion explores different perspectives on the power of negative thinking and its impact on computer science and mathematics.

### Can LLMs learn from a single example?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.fast.ai/posts/2023-09-04-learning-jumps/) | 426 points | by [jdkee](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jdkee) | [133 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37399873)

A recent study on large language models (LLMs) has discovered a surprising anomaly in their training process. It was found that these models are capable of rapidly memorizing examples from the dataset after just a single exposure, which goes against the conventional wisdom about neural network sample efficiency. This unexpected phenomenon prompted further investigation and a series of experiments to validate and understand this behavior. The results indicate that the models indeed exhibit rapid memorization capabilities, questioning the current approach to training and utilizing LLMs. This finding opens up new possibilities for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of neural networks and challenges the long-standing assumption of their slow learning process.

The discussion surrounding the submission begins with a user named "jph00" expressing surprise at the rapid memorization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) and how it challenges existing assumptions about neural network sample efficiency. Another user, "og_kalu," suggests trying to freeze the training of LLMs after initial exposure to improve efficiency. "jph00" shares that the experiments conducted didn't show catastrophic forgetting, but rather the models becoming overly confident. They see this as an opportunity rather than a problem.

The conversation then shifts to other topics related to training and understanding neural networks. Users discuss training natural intelligence models, the potential for catastrophic forgetting, and the importance of freezing lower layers in LLMs to prevent forgetting fundamental knowledge. There is also mention of the Internal Family Systems model and its similarities to neural network training.

Some users express their appreciation for the investigation and its potential implications, while others request further explanation and clarification. There is a brief discussion about catastrophic forgetting and its impact on model performance. Another user asks for an explanation of the phenomenon in simpler terms (eli5). The concept of catastrophic forgetting is further explored, with some users suggesting modifications to the sampling model.

### Artificial Consciousness Remains Impossible (Part 2)

#### [Submission URL](https://mindmatters.ai/2023/09/artificial-consciousness-remains-impossible-part-2/) | 20 points | by [momirlan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=momirlan) | [82 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37412555)

In this article, the author presents responses to counterarguments against their thesis from part one. They address objections claiming that consciousness and intentionality are subjective and cannot be proven. The author argues that without intentionality, we would not understand anything, as words would not refer to anything. They also refute the idea that consciousness is something that is "done" and argue that an AGI could perform tasks without being conscious. 

The author then discusses objections from functionalism, which suggest that replicating the functions of a brain would lead to artificial consciousness. They argue that functionalist arguments fail because duplicating a function requires complete visibility and measurability of all functions and dependencies, which is not possible due to underdetermination. 

Finally, the author addresses behaviorist objections, which claim that reproducing conscious behaviors equates to producing consciousness. They disagree with the idea that observable behaviors alone indicate consciousness and reference the Chinese Room argument. 

Overall, the author provides counterarguments against various objections to their thesis, emphasizing the importance of intentionality and highlighting the limitations of functionalism and behaviorism in explaining consciousness.

The discussion on this submission covers various perspectives on consciousness and artificial intelligence. One commenter argues that artificial neural networks today do not have the same complexity and topology of states as real neural networks, while another points out that replicating the topology is not sufficient for generating consciousness. There is also a debate about whether consciousness is dependent on specific states of neurons or if it is a separate non-physical property. 

The conversation then shifts to the limitations of current AI models and the importance of memory in consciousness. Some commenters express their experiences of consciousness and memory, while others argue that consciousness cannot exist in artificial systems. 

The discussion also touches on functionalism, with one commenter arguing that replicating brain functions would not lead to artificial consciousness. Another commenter brings up the example of AlphaZero, a computer program that plays creative games of chess, to demonstrate that computers can exhibit creativity without conscious intention. 

There is also a disagreement about the significance of considering individuals' consciousness and the possibility of artificial consciousness. Some commenters argue that humans place too much importance on themselves, while others posit that empathy and understanding others' experiences are essential. 

The discussion concludes with a debate about the nature of intentional and qualitative experiences and their role in determining the existence of consciousness.

### Run ChatGPT-like LLMs on your laptop in 3 lines of code

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/amaiya/onprem) | 141 points | by [amaiya](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=amaiya) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37412793)

OnPrem.LLM is a Python package that simplifies running large language models (LLMs) on-premises using non-public or sensitive data, even behind corporate firewalls. It was inspired by the privateGPT GitHub repo and Simon Willison's LLM command-line utility, and is designed to seamlessly integrate local LLMs into practical applications.

To get started, simply install OnPrem.LLM after installing PyTorch. You can then import the LLM class and instantiate it. By default, a 7B-parameter model is used, but you can specify a 13B-parameter model or provide the URL to an LLM of your choice.

Once set up, you can send prompts to the LLM to solve problems using few-shot prompting. You provide an example of what you want the LLM to do, and it generates the desired output. You can also talk to your documents by ingesting them into a vector database and asking questions about them. The LLM will generate answers based on the content of your documents.

Ingesting the documents involves specifying the directory containing the documents and creating embeddings for them. This process may take some time, but once complete, you can query your documents using the LLM's `ask` method to get answers to specific questions.

OnPrem.LLM is a powerful tool for running large language models on-premises and working with non-public data. With its user-friendly interface and seamless integration, it enables practical applications using LLMs behind corporate firewalls or with sensitive data. Give it a try and see how it can enhance your workflow!

The discussion on this submission revolves around various aspects of running large language models (LLMs) locally and the features and limitations of the OnPrem.LLM tool.

- One user shares a link to instructions on how to run the LLM locally on a Macbook with M1/M2 and 32GB RAM using the OnPrem.LLM tool. They mention that following these instructions allows them to run 34B models using both the CPU and GPU.

- Another user mentions that GGUF (Great Generic Unifying Framework) format was introduced in August 2023 as a replacement for GGML (Great Generic Modeling Language), and GGUF is supported by the OnPrem.LLM tool.

- A conversation ensues regarding the compatibility of OnPrem.LLM tool with different formats, and it is clarified that while it currently supports GGML format, there are plans to support GGUF format in future versions.

- A user praises the simplicity and usefulness of the OnPrem.LLM tool, mentioning that they have tried it and found it to be a great way to reduce the complexity of working with LLMs locally.

### AI-generated child sex imagery has every US Attorney General calling for action

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-generated-child-sex-imagery-has-every-us-attorney-general-calling-for-action/) | 17 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37412525)

Attorneys general from all 50 states in the US, along with officials from four territories, have called on Congress to establish an expert commission to study how generative artificial intelligence (AI) could be used to exploit children through the creation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM). The attorneys general are concerned that AI is creating a new frontier for abuse that makes prosecution more difficult, particularly as open-source image synthesis technologies make it easy to create AI-generated pornography. They also want existing laws against CSAM to be expanded to explicitly cover AI-generated materials.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of perspectives on the issue of AI-generated child sexual abuse material (CSAM). Some users argue that AI-generated CSAM should not be legally considered CSAM, as it is fundamentally different from traditional material and may not involve the exploitation of actual children. Others express concerns about the potential harm caused by AI-generated CSAM and suggest that existing laws against CSAM should be expanded to explicitly cover AI-generated materials. There is also debate about the role of AI in identifying and preventing CSAM, with some users suggesting that AI could be used for better recognition and verification of CSAM, while others argue that AI could also be used to create more convincing and harmful content. Overall, the discussion explores different perspectives on the legal and ethical implications of AI-generated CSAM.
