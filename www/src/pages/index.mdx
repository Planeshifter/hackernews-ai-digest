### Calendar meeting links used to spread Mac malware

#### [Submission URL](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2024/02/calendar-meeting-links-used-to-spread-mac-malware/) | 83 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39540793)

Malicious hackers are using a clever tactic that starts with adding a link to the victim's calendar on Calendly, a popular scheduling application. The attackers pose as well-known cryptocurrency investors, scheduling video calls that lead to the installation of malware on macOS systems. One startup seeking investment for a blockchain platform fell victim to this scam, as detailed by KrebsOnSecurity.

The scam begins with an impersonator on Telegram, using the name and profile of a legitimate investor, to schedule a video call through Calendly. When the victim clicks the meeting link, a script is run quietly installing malware. In this case, the scam artists pretended to be from Signum Capital, a reputable investment firm based in Singapore. The victim, known as "Doug," eventually realized the ruse after encountering technical difficulties during the video call setup, prompting a suspicious response.

This incident sheds light on a sophisticated phishing campaign linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers who use social engineering tactics. The malicious script, disguised as a legitimate meeting link, leads users to unwittingly download and execute malware, granting hackers control over the victim's computer. The attackers, associated with the group BlueNoroff, a subgroup of the notorious Lazarus hacking group, target various industries to steal funds and cryptocurrency.

While macOS systems are not immune to such threats, the incident emphasizes the need for vigilance and cybersecurity measures, especially as cybercriminals evolve their tactics to bypass existing defenses. It serves as a critical reminder for individuals and organizations in the cryptocurrency space to stay wary of social engineering attacks and prioritize security protocols to safeguard sensitive information.

### Conditional Love for AWS Metadata Enumeration

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.plerion.com/conditional-love-for-aws-metadata-enumeration/) | 19 points | by [kiyanwang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kiyanwang) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39508239)

The latest findings in AWS security reveal a potential vulnerability that could allow attackers to access sensitive metadata from public AWS resources by enumerating account IDs. This technique, inspired by a previous researcher's work, involves exploiting the "s3:ResourceAccount" condition key to guess account IDs and gain unauthorized access to resources.

By leveraging specific IAM policy conditions, attackers can manipulate AWS API calls to test different account IDs systematically, significantly reducing the guesswork involved. This method not only demonstrates the importance of secure AWS configurations but also highlights the need for continuous vigilance against potential attacks.

Furthermore, the research extends beyond S3 buckets to identify other resources vulnerable to this enumeration tactic, such as Data Exchange data sets and Lambda URL invocations. This discovery underscores the ongoing efforts required to safeguard cloud environments and underscores the significance of proactive security measures in the face of evolving threats.

The discussion on the submission about AWS security vulnerability revolves around the potential attack vector that allows attackers to access sensitive metadata from public AWS resources. 

- **ComputerGuru** points out that understanding AWS doesn't mean there is a flaw in the system; a denial response does not necessarily indicate a failure in the policy, and requests can succeed. They mention a case where streaming content through signed URLs in AWS buckets could circumvent standard non-public bucket procedures, highlighting that the attack method may not work depending on the request fulfillment. 
- **Temporary_31337** suggests that fixing the issue might be challenging in AWS as making IAM (Identity and Access Management) more restrictive could have unintended consequences. They raise concerns about the difficulty in patching/improving the system due to potential compatibility issues and the risk of breaking existing setups, emphasizing that making it harder to exploit could also limit legitimate use cases.
- **ncrnk** comments on a specific method for figuring out the AWS Snowflake internal stage buckets and Snowflake sharing through VPC Endpoint Policies.

The conversation underscores the complexity of addressing the vulnerability and the importance of carefully balancing security measures with system usability to prevent potential attacks.
