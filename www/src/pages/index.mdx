#### [Submission URL](https://near.blog/personality-basins/) | 155 points | by [qouteall](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qouteall) | [108 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42203635)

In a thought-provoking post, a user dives deep into the concept of "personality basins," likening the development of personality to machine learning processes like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The author suggests that our personalities are not fixed traits but rather shaped continuously by interactions with our environment, much like how a machine learning model adapts based on feedback. 

Born with certain genetic traits, individuals navigate their world, honing specific behaviors through positive or negative reinforcement. Adolescence emerges as a critical period for this learning, marked by high social and environmental entropy that enhances neuroplasticity, enabling youth to rapidly adapt their personalities to succeed in their circumstances. 

The user introduces the idea of personality as a landscape of potential traits, where one's experiences mold their identity over time, eventually leading them to settle into a “basin” that reflects their successful adaptations. Most changes to personality happen unconsciously, as our brains constantly adjust behavior based on what works or doesn't in our social contexts. Recognizing this can lead to self-reflection on how we form preferences and behaviors, shedding light on how environment and social contexts shape our perceptions and identities.

Overall, the analogy helps to frame personality as dynamic and adaptable, inviting readers to contemplate their own journeys and the nuanced factors that influence who they are.
