#### [Submission URL](https://lwn.net/SubscriberLink/983965/3266dc25bf5c68d7/) | 60 points | by [immibis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=immibis) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41182917)

In a recent examination of the Linux kernel's use of preprocessor macros, particularly the min() and max() functions, Jonathan Corbet highlights an intriguing issue impacting compilation times. Originally designed to simplify comparisons, these macros have undergone numerous changes, with their complexity increasing significantly over time. 

The problems were brought to light by Arnd Bergmann, who noted that recent compilation had ballooned, with one file taking 15 seconds just to pass through the preprocessor. The nested structure of the min() and max() macros, particularly through the min3() function which further compounds their usage, led to an astonishing 47MB output from a single line of code due to excessive expansions. 

This complexity is of great concern since kernel developers prioritize efficient build times. Following the recognition of this growing issue, developers swiftly responded with proposed patches aimed at streamlining macro expansion and ultimately reducing compilation times. The discussion underscores an ongoing balancing act within kernel development, where striving for type safety and flexibility must also yield efficient performance. As patch series emerge, it remains to be seen how effectively these issues will be resolved, ensuring both the robustness and efficiency of kernel builds.

The discussion surrounding the issue with the Linux kernel's complex preprocessor macros, specifically the min() and max() functions, reveals a variety of perspectives from contributors. Some express concern about the macros' increasing complexity over time, which has led to significantly longer compilation times, with instances of single files taking up to 15 seconds through preprocessing. Users noted that the extensive expansion of such macros resulted in outputs as large as 47MB.

Contributors debated the implications of using nested macros, questioning their impact on compilation efficiency and type compatibility. Some advocated for a shift towards solutions that might minimize macro complexity, citing that the issues are particularly evident in specific development environments, such as with GCC and C++ features. Others expressed caution about potential changes that could affect the robustness and predictability of the kernel's performance.

Discussion also highlighted the balance between striving for code maintainability and keeping compilation times efficient. Several users proposed alternatives to the current usage of macros, suggesting that better practices could mitigate the adverse effects on compilation times without sacrificing functional integrity. Overall, the comments reveal a community grappling with the trade-offs between macro utility and system performance, while also calling for heightened awareness about the design and implementation of macros in critical systems like the Linux kernel.

A new exploration in the world of the Bruijn programming language is pushing the boundaries of arithmetic with arbitrary precision. Following the insights of Reddit user u/DaVinci103, this project offers a compelling expansion to support not just integers, but also rational, real, and complex numbers encoded through lambda calculus. 

The beauty of this approach is its elegance and efficiency. In lambdas, integers can be represented seamlessly as Church numerals, while rational numbers take shape as pairs of balanced ternary numbers — allowing for negative values without increasing complexity. The big leap, however, is the implementation of real numbers, which previously stumped the author until inspiration struck via a fruitful Reddit post.

Breaking the implementation down, the author demystifies how to craft these mathematical operations from the ground up. For example, with rational numbers, you simply use two balanced ternary numbers while adhering to a non-zero denominator constraint. Through succinct syntax and clever use of combinatorial logic, the language can handle comparisons and calculations seamlessly.

The end result is a fascinating dive into Bruijn coding that not only showcases advanced arithmetic capabilities but also makes a case for how lambda calculus can elegantly simplify complex numerical systems. The author invites readers to explore these definitions and implementations, bringing both mathematical theory and pragmatic coding together in a way that is both informative and actionable. 

If you're intrigued by the intersection of programming, mathematics, and theoretical computing, this article is a must-read for grasping how to utilize Bruijn for advanced numerical manipulations.

The discussion thread following the submission on Bruijn programming language dives deep into various aspects and implications of representing numbers in advanced arithmetic with arbitrary precision. One participant, trmp, discusses the complexities of accurately approximating real numbers and suggests that the representation of natural numbers could lead to non-terminating approximations, which is necessary for certain computations. Similarly, cvss emphasizes the mathematical underpinnings where real numbers are viewed as a limit function, while also hinting at the complexities that arise with infinite series and functions.

mrvnbrnr contributes to the discourse by clarifying the project's aims and encouraging the exploration of mathematical concepts like differentiability within the context of the Bruijn language. Others, such as cryptnctr, echo appreciation for the nuanced programming techniques discussed, viewing them as practical solutions for number representation, especially in programming languages like Python.

Another recurring theme is the concern about the practicality of representing rational numbers and the implications of dealing with denominators, as noted by prrb and supported by mrkn, who clarify that managing zero as a denominator can complicate implementations. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a blend of programming language theory, mathematical intuition, and practical implementation, encouraging participants to explore the elegant representations of numbers and operations they can facilitate through the Bruijn language.
