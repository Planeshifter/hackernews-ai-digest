OpenAI's newly launched ChatGPT Search is generating buzz as a potential contender against Google, but early tests reveal it might still fall short. Maxwell Zeff shares his experiences after a day of using the AI-driven search tool, which promises a fresh, concise interface but often stumbles on everyday queries.

While ChatGPT Search excels at providing detailed answers for complex questions, it struggles with short, keyword-based searches—the bread and butter of Google users. For common inquiries like "Celtics score" or "library hours," Zeff found the AI often delivered inaccurate or irrelevant results, even producing false data and broken links. In contrast, he defaulted back to Google for its reliability, despite acknowledging the latter's gradual decline in quality.

OpenAI’s Sam Altman heralded the new tool's potential, and there’s hope for improvement as user feedback rolls in. Although it might not yet be a "Google killer," ChatGPT Search showcases intriguing possibilities for the future of AI-powered online searching. As it stands, it appears that Google remains the go-to for those quick, navigational queries that dominate most users' daily searches.

In a lively discussion on Hacker News, users engaged with a comment by "BizarroLand" regarding the limitations of ChatGPT Search compared to Google. BizarroLand humorously likened the situation to a mythical battle, suggesting that calling ChatGPT a "Google killer" was overly ambitious. They highlighted the tool's struggles with specific types of searches, including music file queries, and noted the absence of response from ChatGPT in such cases.

In response, "Leynos" referenced a specific query related to file types and pointed out the inadequacies of ChatGPT Search in delivering relevant results, implying that it lacks functionality for practical uses. "FirmwareBurner" chimed in with a lighthearted comment questioning whether large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT may inadvertently reinforce biases instead of correcting them. Overall, the comments emphasized skepticism regarding ChatGPT Search's readiness to rival Google, with humor interspersed throughout the debate.
