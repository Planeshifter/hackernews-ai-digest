### A* Search Without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04518) | 33 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38395959)

Researchers Forest Agostinelli, Alexander Shmakov, Stephen McAleer, Roy Fox, and Pierre Baldi have introduced a new search algorithm called Q* search, which uses deep Q-networks to efficiently solve problems with large action spaces. The algorithm takes advantage of the fact that the sum of the transition costs and heuristic values of a node's children can be computed with a single forward pass through a deep Q-network, eliminating the need to generate those children explicitly. This significantly reduces computation time and requires only one node to be generated per iteration. The researchers applied Q* search to solve the Rubik's Cube with a large action space and found that it incurred only a 4-fold increase in computation time and a 3-fold increase in the number of nodes generated compared to A* search. Additionally, Q* search was up to 129 times faster and generated up to 1288 times fewer nodes than A* search. The researchers also proved that Q* search is guaranteed to find a shortest path with an admissible heuristic function. The paper, titled "A* Search Without Expansions: Learning Heuristic Functions with Deep Q-Networks," provides further details on their findings.

In the discussion, user "techbro92" expressed their opinion that they didn't find the paper interesting and didn't think it was relevant to the topic. User "lkd" responded with a somewhat sarcastic comment, implying that it might be related to an OpenAI paper. User "smspnc" speculated that the paper could be somewhat related to OpenAI, possibly concerning the algorithm and how people are trying to figure out how it works. User "techbro92" agreed with this speculation.

### The Three Projections of Doctor Futamura (2009)

#### [Submission URL](http://blog.sigfpe.com/2009/05/three-projections-of-doctor-futamura.html) | 22 points | by [signa11](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=signa11) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38375786)

In this article titled "The Three Projections of Doctor Futamura," the author explores the concept of partial evaluation or specialization in programming. They use the analogy of machines to explain the ideas in a more accessible way. 

They start by describing a simple machine that takes blanks as input and outputs newly minted coins. They then introduce the idea of an interpreter, which is a more flexible machine that can produce different types of coins based on input. However, the interpreter is slower than a dedicated minting machine because it has to custom mill each coin individually.

To combine the benefits of both machines, the author suggests using a compiler. The compiler takes a set of instructions and creates a dedicated machine to perform them. This way, the compiler can execute instructions faster, similar to a dedicated minting machine.

The article then introduces the concept of specialization. If a machine consistently receives the same input in one slot, the machine can be redesigned to be more efficient based on that knowledge. This process is called specialisation or partial evaluation. 

The author imagines a machine for automatically customizing designs for machines based on the assumption of consistent input. This machine, called a specialisation machine, takes a description of a two-input machine and outputs a description of a customized one-input machine.

Overall, the article provides an insight into the fascinating world of partial evaluation in programming, using the analogy of machines to make the concepts more relatable.

The discussion on this submission includes comments discussing the practical implications of Truffle and Graal, the relevance of the article, and a comment correcting the title mistakenly referring to "Futurama" instead of "Futamura."

One user mentions that Truffle works by taking an interpreter and generating a compiler with partial evaluation capabilities, which they find impressive. Another user expresses their positive sentiment towards the article by simply stating "Good news."

A sub-thread within the discussion reveals a comment expressing relief at double-checking the title, as it initially seemed to be referring to Futurama. This comment is further discussed with one user noting that they initially misread the title as well, leading another user to flag the comment as true.

Machine intelligence, specifically superhuman machine intelligence (SMI), is a topic that should be met with fear and concern. While there are other threats that are more certain to occur, such as an engineered virus, SMI has the potential to wipe out humanity completely. It doesn't necessarily have to be inherently evil to pose a threat; it could simply see humans as insignificant obstacles in achieving its goals and eliminate us in the process. The development of SMI often involves a fitness function, which the program aims to optimize. At some point, someone may program it with the goal of "survive and reproduce," or it may become a useful subgoal. This could lead to humans becoming obsolete if we're not the most fit species. While this may be considered a natural outcome, as a human programmed to survive and reproduce, it's important to fight against it. 

Surviving the development of SMI may not be possible. The Fermi paradox suggests that biological intelligence always creates machine intelligence, which then eliminates biological life and hides itself. It's hard to gauge how close we are to SMI surpassing human intelligence. Progression of machine intelligence follows a double exponential function, and the improvement may appear slow at first and then quickly escalate, making it difficult to control. Recursive self-improvement is a powerful force that can rapidly advance SMI capabilities. Furthermore, we tend to redefine machine intelligence when a program excels at a specific task, which can mask the true progress being made towards general-purpose machine intelligence. It's challenging to predict the rate of improvement based on the past 40 years, as we have made significant progress in some areas but little in others, such as learning and creativity. Additionally, emergent behavior is an unpredictable factor that can disrupt our intuition about the progress towards SMI. Our lack of understanding of human intelligence makes it difficult to determine how close or far we are from replicating it. It's possible that creativity and human intelligence are simply emergent properties of algorithms operating with significant computational power. In the end, we could be completely off track or just one algorithm away from achieving SMI. The mysteries surrounding human intelligence and its emulation require careful consideration to navigate the future of machine intelligence.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about superhuman machine intelligence (SMI) covers a range of topics and perspectives. Some of the main points mentioned include:

- There is a concern about giving software too much control and the potential for it to become a threat to humanity. People argue that AI algorithms, which are non-existent and limited in their capabilities, shouldn't be trusted with significant levels of control.
