### OpenAI adds MCP support to Agents SDK

#### [Submission URL](https://openai.github.io/openai-agents-python/mcp/) | 736 points | by [gronky_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gronky_) | [225 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43485566)

In the ever-evolving landscape of AI, the Model Context Protocol (MCP) is emerging as a vital standard for connecting Large Language Models (LLMs) with various tools and data sources. Drawing parallels with the universal appeal of USB-C ports, MCP aims to simplify and streamline the interaction between AI applications and a plethora of external resources.

MCP accomplishes this by defining an open protocol, much akin to creating a universal adapter that AI models can plug into for additional functionalities. This protocol supports two types of server transport mechanisms: stdio for running locally as subprocesses, and HTTP over Server-Sent Events (SSE) for remote connections. Developers can leverage these via the MCPServerStdio and MCPServerSse classes, offering flexibility depending on the operational environment.

The integration into systems is facilitated by the Agents SDK, which empowers applications to dynamically access and utilize a broad array of tools hosted on MCP servers. For instance, you might use the official MCP filesystem server to list available tools, enabling the LLM to smartly select and employ them in real-time. The capability to add MCP servers to AI agents enriches their problem-solving capabilities by automatically making them aware of available tools through regular server queries.

However, this integration isn't without its quirks. Continuous querying to update tool lists might incur latency, especially for remote servers. To combat this, caching mechanisms are available, although they're advised only when tool lists are static. Developers can also manage cache freshness, ensuring that outdated tool data doesn't impair functionality.

For those eager to dive deeper, comprehensive end-to-end examples are provided, alongside tracing capabilities that log MCP interactions for debugging and optimization purposes. As MCP gains traction, it promises to be a crucial component in harmonizing and optimizing AI application ecosystems, setting a foundation for more connected and capable machine intelligence.

Others argued that **OpenAPI** or **GraphQL** might offer better semantic interfaces for API tooling, with GraphQL praised for its flexibility in data-heavy AI use cases.

2. **Simplicity vs. Complexity**:  
   - While MCP’s vision of standardizing LLM-tool interactions was welcomed, critics questioned its added complexity. Some suggested falling back to traditional HTTP servers or OpenAPI specs, arguing that MCP’s remote server implementation introduces unnecessary overhead. Proponents countered that MCP’s local-first approach (via stdio) and optional HTTP/SSE for remote use strike a balance.

3. **LangChain Critique**:  
   - A subthread criticized **LangChain** as overly abstract and unwieldy, calling it a "Frankenstein’s monster" of APIs. Many saw MCP as a cleaner alternative, though concerns lingered about its own abstraction layers and developer experience.

4. **Use Cases & Integration**:  
   - Supporters highlighted MCP’s potential for tasks like database queries, Docker management, OCR, and browser automation. Integration with existing OpenAPI specs was seen as a strength, though some questioned how MCP would handle dynamic vs. static tooling (e.g., caching trade-offs).

5. **Historical Context**:  
   - Debates echoed past REST vs. RPC wars, with users reflecting on lessons from early HTTP standards. Some viewed MCP’s RPC-like approach as pragmatic, while others warned against repeating history with overly rigid protocols.

6. **Industry Alignment**:  
   - Comparisons were drawn to **OpenAI’s plugins**, with hopes that MCP could evolve into a broader industry standard rather than a vendor-specific solution. However, skepticism remained about adoption momentum and developer buy-in.

In summary, the discussion reflects cautious optimism for MCP’s potential to streamline LLM-tool interactions but underscores the need to balance simplicity, flexibility, and lessons from past protocol design.

Data from a study (56 crashes among drivers over 20K miles) was cited to argue that many human drivers have poor safety records. However, critics questioned whether crash statistics fully capture edge cases like pedestrian safety.

2. **Anecdotes and Perception**:  
   Users shared personal experiences, such as Waymo cars being hit by reckless human drivers (e.g., rear-end collisions at stops). Some found AVs overly cautious, frustrating human drivers, while others praised their predictability.

3. **Insurance and Cost Debates**:  
   Discussions touched on insurance implications, with speculation that AV data could lower premiums. Tesla’s higher insurance rates were debated—attributed to repair costs, vandalism, or slow parts availability. Others proposed tying insurance costs to driver behavior to incentivize safety.

4. **Regulation and Enforcement**:  
   Ideas included stricter licensing (e.g., revoking licenses after repeat crashes) or banning high-risk drivers. Critics countered that enforcement is challenging and could disproportionately impact low-income groups reliant on driving for work.

5. **AV Challenges and Optimism**:  
   While Waymo’s safety metrics were seen as promising, users emphasized that AVs must still navigate complex human-driven environments. Some highlighted incidents where AVs followed traffic laws but were still involved in crashes due to other drivers’ errors.

6. **Cultural and Systemic Factors**:  
   The discussion acknowledged societal resistance to AVs, the need for better integration with existing infrastructure, and the potential economic disruptions (e.g., impacting ride-share drivers). Others argued AV adoption will hinge on proving reliability and affordability at scale.

In summary, the thread reflects cautious optimism about AVs’ long-term safety potential but underscores unresolved challenges in data interpretation, regulation, and coexistence with human drivers.

At Qodo, we're taking the world of AI coding assistants to new heights with the help of LangGraph. Since the release of Claude Sonnet 3.5 nine months ago, large language models (LLMs) have transformed how we tackle coding tasks, and we're embracing this by making our agents more dynamic and flexible while maintaining high standards for code quality.

Our journey began with structured flows for tasks like test generation and code reviews that worked well with older models. However, the robustness of newer models encouraged us to transition from rigid frameworks to more adaptive agents. We needed a system that aligned with our opinionated views on AI in coding and could keep pace with rapid advancements in the field. That's where LangGraph came in.

LangGraph allows us to blend flexibility with structure through a graph-based approach, making it easy to create workflows that are adaptable yet opinionated. The framework enables a state-machine architecture, where nodes represent workflow steps and edges dictate transitions. Whether we create sparse graphs for predictable outcomes or dense ones for more autonomy, LangGraph provides the flexibility to fine-tune our flows as models evolve.

Our main workflow exemplifies this flexibility. It starts with a context collector node gathering essential information, followed by a planning node to outline the task, an execution node for code generation, and a validation node to ensure quality. If validation fails, the agent loops back to execution for refinement, ensuring robustness without sacrificing adaptability.

LangGraph's API prioritizes simplicity, making our workflows easy to understand and alter. Each node executes clear functions, enhancing transparency and maintainability. Unlike overly complex frameworks, LangGraph aligns with our thinking and displays agent logic straightforwardly.

Reusable components are another strength of LangGraph. Nodes such as context collectors and validators are integral parts of multiple workflows, reducing redundancy and increasing efficiency. As we continue to develop specialized flows, the framework's modularity already yields significant productivity gains.

   - AI crawlers often mimic DDoS attacks, overwhelming servers with high-volume, distributed requests, leading to downtime for platforms like MIT Press and OAPEN.  

### 2. **Techniques and Evasion**  
   - AI companies use residential proxies, browser extensions, and malware-like tactics to mask scraping activities, bypassing IP blocks and rate-limiting.  
   - Examples include OpenAI’s alleged use of browser extensions to monitor traffic and services selling residential IP addresses to evade detection.  

### 3. **Defensive Challenges**  
   - Traditional defenses (CAPTCHAs, IP blocking) struggle against distributed, AI-driven bots. Tools like Cloudflare offer temporary relief but are not foolproof.  
   - Smaller sites lack resources to implement robust defenses, diverting developer time from innovation to bot mitigation.  

### 4. **Ethical and Systemic Concerns**  
   - Financial incentives drive companies to prioritize data extraction over ethical scraping, undermining open-access missions.  
   - BitTorrent is cited as a cooperative alternative, rewarding contributors and resisting centralized disruption, contrasting with AI’s exploitative model.  

### 5. **Solutions Proposed**  
   - **Technical**: Stricter API usage, JavaScript/CSS requirements (controversial for accessibility), and semantic web standards to structure data for fair access.  
   - **Legal**: Addressing SDKs/malware enabling botnets and blocking services facilitating abusive scraping.  
   - **Cultural**: Advocating for ethical guidelines and systemic shifts to prioritize sustainable, community-driven data access over profit-driven extraction.

In an unexpected twist of cinematic prophecy, Angelina Jolie’s character in the 1995 film *Hackers* predicted the future of computer architecture. During a scene with Jonny Lee Miller, she mentions RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) architecture, stating it would "change everything." Fast-forward 28 years, and it turns out she wasn't wrong. RISC architecture, particularly in the form of RISC-V, is at the forefront of technological innovation, influencing everything from cars to AI systems.

Despite its growing influence, the RISC-V community is grappling with a peculiar challenge—they're faced with an industry that benefits immensely from their architecture but remains mostly oblivious to its intricacies. This was evident at the annual RISC-V summit in Santa Clara, where activists of this burgeoning tech movement mingled, exchanging complex jargon unfamiliar to the outside world.

Enter Calista Redmond, CEO of RISC-V International, who is zealously ensuring that the organization's efforts not only propel technological advancements but also maintain relevance amid geopolitical tensions. Her confident address at the summit echoed Hackers' prescience, as she declared RISC-V's transformative impact on modern technology, making it a perfect testament to Jolie’s on-screen assertion.

However, as Redmond points out, the challenge remains that while RISC architecture is revolutionizing tech infrastructure, the average consumer is more concerned with functionality and cost-efficiency than the underlying architecture. As WIRED’s Jason says, it’s an untold story eagerly waiting to be shared, akin to a real-life, ongoing hacker saga that too few recognize for its futuristic foresight and current implications.

Thus, while the movie *Hackers* may have been ahead of its time, the tech it predicted is undeniably shaping our world today, even if unnoticed by many. The narrative around RISC and its promising future is unfolding quietly but distinctly, thanks in part to visionaries within the community and cinematic winks from the past.

The discussion revolves around the intersection of *Hackers*' prescient portrayal of RISC architecture and its real-world impact today, with several key points:  

1. **AI and Media**: Users note the irony of WIRED (owned by Condé Nast) covering RISC-V while its parent company uses OpenAI tools like ChatGPT for content. This sparks debate about AI's role in tech journalism and whether it aligns with the "hacker ethos" depicted in the film.  

2. **Industry Moves**: Commenters highlight leadership shifts, including Calista Redmond (RISC-V International CEO) and her prior role at Nvidia, alongside nods to executives like Doug Bowser (Nintendo) and Carol Surface (ex-Apple). These figures symbolize RISC-V’s growing influence across tech sectors.  

3. **Technical Nitpicking**: A user humorously critiques the *Hackers* scene, pointing out technical inaccuracies (e.g., PCI bus references, graphics performance) but acknowledges its symbolic foresight about rapid hardware innovation. David Patterson, a RISC pioneer, is mentioned as someone who might appreciate the film’s legacy despite its flaws.  

4. **Meta Commentary**: The discussion includes a link to an archived article (likely the WIRED piece) and a joke about paywalls, underscoring frustrations with access to tech journalism even as RISC-V’s story remains underrecognized.  

In essence, the thread blends nostalgia for *Hackers* with reflections on RISC-V’s quiet revolution, corporate dynamics, and the evolving role of AI in storytelling—all while poking fun at the quirks of tech culture.

In a compelling narrative that has the tech community buzzing, software developer Xe Iaso shared their struggle against relentless AI crawlers wreaking havoc on their Git repository service. Despite deploying standard defenses like robots.txt and blocking certain user-agents, Iaso found these bots sidestepping every measure, leading to repeated service disruptions. Frustrated, Iaso introduced "Anubis," a unique proof-of-work system that challenges browsers to solve computational puzzles before accessing the site.

Unfortunately, Iaso’s battle is not isolated. Their plight sheds light on a broader crisis within the open source community, which is being inundated with bot traffic that mimics distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. An alarming report by LibreNews highlighted that some projects see upwards of 97% of their traffic from AI company bots, causing service instability, driving up bandwidth costs, and taxing already overburdened maintainers. 

Projects like Fedora Pagure and GNOME have taken extreme measures, such as blocking whole countries or adopting Iaso's Anubis system. However, these solutions sometimes lead to significant delays for legitimate users, frustrating those who face up to two-minute waits to access shared links.

Open source initiatives, crucial for public collaboration and operated with limited resources, now grapple with AI crawlers that flagrantly ignore standard web protocols, evade detection, and sap both technical and financial resources. Martin Owens of the Inkscape project lamented this "prodigious block list" caused by AI companies disrespecting existing guidelines.

Commentary on Hacker News about Iaso's fight reflects widespread developer anger towards what many see as predatory practices by AI firms, indifferent to the goodwill essential in open source environments. This tension is exacerbated as some open source projects handle costly AI-generated traffic that surfloads system resources, making it particularly brutal for repositories like SourceHut and the Curl project.

The grim reality is that these AI crawls not only drain financial resources but also waste developers' time with fake bug reports, revealing a growing disconnect between AI companies and the community-driven ethos of open source development. As the community seeks solutions, a call for more ethical behavior and respect from AI companies is growing louder.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Xe Iaso's battle with AI crawlers reflects a mix of technical debate, shared frustration, and creative solutions. Key themes include:

1. **Bypassing Traditional Defenses**: Users noted AI crawlers easily circumvent standard tools like `robots.txt` and user-agent blocking (e.g., Huawei’s PetalBot ignoring restrictions). Some suggested using invisible hyperlinks to trap bots, though concerns about accessibility for screen readers were raised.

2. **Rate-Limiting Challenges**: Strategies like IP-based rate-limiting were criticized for being impractical, as AI traffic often mimics human patterns (e.g., low requests per IP). Blocking entire IP ranges (e.g., Huawei’s Singapore mobile network) was shared as a drastic measure, but risks overblocking legitimate users.

3. **Proof-of-Work Systems**: Anubis, a proof-of-work system requiring computational puzzles for access, was highlighted as a novel deterrent. While praised for slowing bots, concerns about its impact on user experience (e.g., delays) and client-side processing overhead were discussed. Alternatives like bcrypt-style hashing or encrypted content layers were also proposed.

4. **Ethical and Resource Strain**: Many lamented AI companies’ disregard for open-source community norms, as their crawlers drain resources (bandwidth, maintenance time) and generate fake issues. Some endorsed “data poisoning” to sabotage AI training sets as a retaliatory measure.

5. **Technical Workarounds**: Users shared mitigations like using Cloudflare, caching, or serving static content to reduce server load. However, these were seen as partial fixes, with calls for AI firms to adopt ethical scraping practices.

### Arc-AGI-2 and ARC Prize 2025

#### [Submission URL](https://arcprize.org/blog/announcing-arc-agi-2-and-arc-prize-2025) | 180 points | by [gkamradt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gkamradt) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43465147)

AI systems continue to struggle with tasks that require them to apply rules contextually rather than globally. Human participants excel in these tasks by intuitively understanding the context in which rules should be applied, while AI systems often falter due to their inability to dynamically interpret such contexts. An example of this can be seen in ARC-AGI-2 Public Eval Task #d90e82f4, which you can attempt to see firsthand the challenge AI faces in this area.

The ARC-AGI-2 and ARC Prize 2025 represent a bold attempt to bridge the "human-AI gap" by continuing to focus on capabilities naturally possessed by humans yet challenging for AI. This approach signifies a pivotal shift from scaling existing AI capabilities to fostering novel innovations that facilitate genuine general intelligence. The ARC Prize continues to invite collaboration from open-source communities and researchers worldwide, driving towards AGI by encouraging a deeper understanding and design of AI systems capable of adaptive learning and nuanced reasoning.

With ARC-AGI-2 setting a higher benchmark, researchers are challenged to develop AI that not only mimics human reasoning but evolves it. As these efforts progress, we're set on a path to not just measure advancements in AI but to inspire groundbreaking innovations to move ever closer to achieving the goals of Artificial General Intelligence.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on ARC-AGI-2 and the ARC Prize 2025:**

The discussion revolves around the ARC-AGI-2 benchmark and the ARC Prize 2025, which aim to advance AI toward human-like reasoning by focusing on tasks requiring contextual understanding rather than memorization. Key points include:

1. **Benchmark Design and Goals**:  
   - The competition emphasizes "test-time reasoning" with tasks calibrated to human difficulty. Current AI models (e.g., GPT-4) score poorly (0-4%), while humans solve tasks quickly.  
   - Test sets are divided into public, semi-private, and private evaluations to prevent data leakage. Kaggle hosts the private evaluation, with strict data agreements to ensure fairness.  

2. **Debates on AGI Definition**:  
   - Skeptics argue that solving ARC tasks (e.g., puzzles) doesn’t equate to AGI, as real-world intelligence involves physical interaction (e.g., cooking, navigating). Others counter that the focus is on reasoning, not robotics.  
   - Some question whether benchmarks can truly measure AGI, likening it to self-driving car challenges where benchmarks may not reflect real-world complexity.  

3. **Technical Concerns**:  
   - Users raise concerns about big AI firms potentially gaming the system (e.g., training on test data). Organizers clarify safeguards, including third-party audits and data retention policies.  
   - ARC-AGI-1 results showed even advanced models like GPT-4 struggled, underscoring the gap between AI and human reasoning.  

4. **Optimism vs. Skepticism**:  
   - Supporters praise the initiative for pushing novel reasoning methods, citing GPT-3.5/4’s incremental progress. Critics argue benchmarks may not inspire practical AGI, comparing solutions to "expensive, unscalable" academic exercises.  

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Participants debate whether AGI requires embodiment (physical interaction) or if abstract reasoning suffices. Some highlight the need for benchmarks that blend cognitive and motor skills.  
   - The competition’s $1M prize and open-source mandate are seen as incentives for innovation, though questions remain about scalability and real-world impact.  

The discussion reflects a mix of enthusiasm for the challenge’s ambition and skepticism about its scope, with the community divided on how best to measure and achieve AGI.
