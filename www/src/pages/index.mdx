### I Program with LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/01/how-i-program-with-llms/) | 28 points | by [Brajeshwar](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Brajeshwar) | [24 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42656188)

David Crawshaw's recent blog post offers an insightful glimpse into his journey of integrating generative models, particularly large language models (LLMs), into his programming routine over the past year. He shares his positive experiences, noting that the use of LLMs has significantly enhanced his productivity, making their absence feel jarring when he tries to code without them.

Crawshaw approaches the use of LLMs through three key methods: **autocomplete**, which handles repetitive typing; **search functionality**, which provides clearer answers to programming queries compared to traditional search engines; and the more complex **chat-driven programming**, which allows for collaborative problem-solving, though he acknowledges the challenges that come with its non-deterministic nature.

Drawing parallels to his past experiences with groundbreaking technology, he argues that the capability of LLMs to assist in crafting code feels revolutionary. He details his motivations for using chat-driven programming, highlighting its ability to jumpstart his coding sessions, especially when he's low on energy or faced with new languages or frameworks.

Crawshaw’s exploration results in meaningful insights about the potential of LLMs in software development, emphasizing an ongoing quest to improve the integration of these tools into the programming landscape. He acknowledges there’s still work to be done, particularly in making chat-driven programming more intuitive and less cumbersome, but he's dedicated to evolving this relationship to maximize efficiency and creativity in coding.

The discussion surrounding David Crawshaw's blog post on integrating large language models (LLMs) into programming practices reveals a variety of user experiences and insights. Participants share how LLMs have significantly enhanced their coding efficiency, with some reporting productivity increases of around 50% when using these tools. Users discuss different applications of LLMs, such as autocomplete features and generating code explanations that can help overcome challenges, particularly when dealing with unfamiliar programming languages or technologies. 

Several commenters reflect on the non-deterministic nature of chat-driven programming, noting both its potential and current limitations. They express a desire for more intuitive and streamlined interactions with LLMs to further improve the coding experience. A recurring theme is the need for a balance between using LLMs to assist in coding while still maintaining a solid understanding of the underlying frameworks and principles, emphasizing the importance of maintainable software and correct integration into existing workflows.

Some participants raise concerns about the limitations of LLM-generated content, particularly in complex problem-solving scenarios, while others highlight the necessity of ensuring LLM outputs meet certain standards and fit within project structures. Overall, the discussion underscores the transformative impact of LLMs in programming, along with the need for ongoing development to refine their usage and make them more effective tools for developers.

### OpenAI's bot crushed this seven-person company's web site 'like a DDoS attack'

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/01/10/how-openais-bot-crushed-this-seven-person-companys-web-site-like-a-ddos-attack/) | 110 points | by [vednig](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vednig) | [101 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42660377)

In a surprising turn of events, a bot from OpenAI launched an aggressive data scraping campaign against Triplegangers, a small e-commerce business specializing in 3D images of human models. This led to Triplegangers' e-commerce site crashing under what CEO Oleksandr Tomchuk described as a DDoS-like attack. OpenAI's bot was reportedly sending tens of thousands of requests from over 600 IP addresses in a relentless attempt to download content from the site, which features a staggering 65,000 products.

Despite having terms of service that prohibit unauthorized scraping, Triplegangers found itself vulnerable because their robot.txt file, which instructs bots on what to crawl, wasn't properly configured—an issue many small sites might face. After several days of being bombarded, they eventually set up proper protections, including blocking OpenAI's bots through Cloudflare.

The fallout included not only a disrupted business operation but also worries about potential legal implications around unauthorized use of scanned images of real people under regulations like GDPR. Tomchuk emphasized the need for small businesses to monitor their server logs meticulously, as many remain unaware they are being scraped by AI bots. This incident highlights ongoing tensions between smaller companies and the aggressive data-gathering practices of some AI technologies, raising ethical questions about data scraping without permission.

In the discussion surrounding a recent incident of aggressive data scraping by an OpenAI bot against Triplegangers, a small e-commerce business, various users voiced their opinions and experiences related to web scraping practices. Here are the main points discussed:

1. **Historical Context**: Some commenters recalled their experiences with web crawlers during the early 2000s, sharing challenges in preventing unwanted scraping and the complexities of enforcing robots.txt directives.

2. **Crawl Rate Issues**: Several users noted concerns regarding the crawling behavior of large bots like Googlebot, where they observed significant increases in requests that did not respect crawl policies, leading to server stress.

3. **Legal Concerns**: Users raised questions about the legal implications of robots.txt files, debating whether they are legally binding and how they relate to web scraping and data usage, particularly in the context of GDPR.

4. **Technical Challenges**: Some participants highlighted the difficulties small businesses face in mitigating scraping attacks, often due to insufficient server log monitoring or the complexity of properly configuring protections like Cloudflare.

5. **Ethical Implications**: The discussion included concerns about the ethical dimensions of aggressive scraping practices, especially the impact on smaller companies’ operations and potential violations of user privacy or intellectual property rights.

6. **Recommendations for Prevention**: Users shared strategies for defending against scraping, including properly managing servers, refining robots.txt configurations, and leveraging technology like rate limiting and IP blocking.

7. **Impacts on Innovation**: Some comments touched on the broader implications of scraping on innovation and the potential negative effects of large corporations' data-gathering practices on smaller entities.

Overall, the conversation emphasized the ongoing challenges small businesses face against aggressive data scraping, the technical and ethical complexities surrounding web crawling, and the need for clearer legal frameworks and best practices to protect against such activities.
