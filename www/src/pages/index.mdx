#### [Submission URL](https://addyosmani.com/blog/double-keyed-caching/) | 45 points | by [feross](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=feross) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42630192)

In a significant shift towards improving user privacy, web caching has undergone a transformation termed "Double-keyed Caching" or cache-partitioning. This change addresses longstanding privacy concerns while impacting web performance and resource management.

Traditionally, browsers stored cached resources in a simplistic key-value format, allowing multiple sites to benefit from shared assets hosted on common CDNs. This efficiency enabled faster loading times and reduced bandwidth costs, making it a favored practice for web development throughout the 2010s. However, this model inadvertently leaked user data, paving the way for potential privacy violations—such as cache probing and cross-site tracking.

The new double-keyed approach alters this system by creating a unique cache entry that combines the requesting site’s origin with the resource’s URL. As a result, even the same resource requested by different sites will be stored separately, effectively preventing cross-site tracking but leading to increased cache misses and greater network demands due to the redundant storage of resources.

Data from Chrome's implementation highlights the trade-offs: a modest rise in cache miss rates and bytes loaded from the network, alongside a slight delay in performance metrics. While this shift enhances privacy by protecting users from various security threats, understanding its ramifications for network bandwidth and application performance is vital for developers.

With popular libraries, fonts, and large resources bearing the brunt of this change, the implications for organizations—especially those relying on shared resources across multiple domains—could result in higher CDN costs and bandwidth usage. As developers adapt to this new reality, balancing the need for privacy with performance optimization will be key in the evolving landscape of web development.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implications and trade-offs of the newly introduced double-keyed caching system that enhances user privacy at the expense of potential web performance issues. 

1. **Shared Resources and Local Options**: Users discuss alternatives to traditional browser caching approaches, such as the LocalCDN extension, which allows downloading common libraries and fonts locally to mitigate privacy concerns. Some participants express that this might unintentionally increase fingerprinting risks.

2. **Domain Consolidation**: There are recommendations for consolidating domains as a strategy to improve caching efficiency, suggesting that with HTTP/2, more connections can be managed, thus enhancing performance while adhering to privacy requirements.

3. **Criticism and Concerns**: Some users are critical of the drastic measures taken to enhance privacy, arguing that while it addresses certain privacy vulnerabilities like cache sniffing and fingerprinting, it may not effectively resolve broader performance issues. Concerns are raised about whether these changes genuinely solve the problems they aim to address.

4. **Performance vs. Privacy Trade-off**: Several commenters highlight the tension between improved privacy and the potential increase in loading times and bandwidth usage due to the changes in caching methods. The idea of balancing these aspects poses a challenge for developers moving forward.

5. **Historical Context**: References to earlier implementations of privacy-focused changes in browsers shed light on the evolution of web security practices. Some participants note that while today's methods might be more privacy-conscious, they have led to additional complexities that need to be navigated.

Overall, the community engages deeply in the implications of double-keyed caching, weighing the benefits against the drawbacks, and contemplating the future landscape of web development as it grapples with these privacy measures.
