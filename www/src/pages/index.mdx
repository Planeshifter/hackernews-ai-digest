### The case for the return of fine-tuning

#### [Submission URL](https://welovesota.com/article/the-case-for-the-return-of-fine-tuning) | 161 points | by [nanark](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nanark) | [80 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45633081)

The Case for the Return of Fine-Tuning (Kevin Kuipers) argues that after falling out of favor, fine-tuning is primed for a comeback—driven by better tooling, slower model churn, and a growing desire for control.

What changed
- Tooling matured: LoRA/PEFT made adapter-style fine-tuning cheap and easy; GPU-as-a-service (e.g., Together.ai) turns setup into minutes, not weeks.
- Model pace stabilized: New releases feel evolutionary, so a tuned model is less likely to be obsoleted overnight.
- Open weights rose: Llama, Mistral, Falcon, Yi, Gemma let teams own and persist bespoke variants without vendor lock-in.
- Market pull: Founders and infra vendors (Hugging Face’s Delangue, NVIDIA DGX Spark chatter, a16z’s Personal AI Workstation) see demand for self-managed, specialized deployments.
- New platform bets: Thinking Machines Labs announced Tinker—fine-tuning-as-a-platform for research and enterprise.

Why fine-tuning faded
- Full fine-tuning (updating all weights) became prohibitively expensive as parameters exploded.
- LoRA changed the cost curve, but the hard part remained: hyperparameter search, avoiding catastrophic forgetting, and evaluation. Meanwhile, prompts + RAG often delivered ~90% of the gains with less ops burden. Today, fine-tuning powers under 10% of inference.

Why it may return
- Control, consistency, latency, and cost at scale—especially for specialized tasks and on-prem/edge settings.
- More robust, repeatable pipelines and a richer open-weight ecosystem.
- Teams appear to be hitting the ceiling of what prompting and RAG alone can deliver.

Practical take
- Use prompting/RAG when you need quick wins, broad coverage, or dynamic knowledge.
- Reach for fine-tuning when you need stable behavior changes, domain style/voice, tighter latency and cost, or offline/controlled environments.
- Remember: LoRA lowers cost, not complexity—budget for data curation, hyperparameter sweeps, and rigorous eval.

Bottom line: Fine-tuning didn’t vanish—it matured. With better infra and clearer use cases, bespoke models look set to claim a bigger slice of production workloads again.

**Summary of the Hacker News Discussion on Fine-Tuning:**

The discussion reflects a mix of skepticism, practical challenges, and cautious optimism about the resurgence of fine-tuning for AI models. Key themes include:

1. **Skepticism and Challenges**:
   - **Skills Gap**: Many engineers (MLEs) lack industry-specific expertise, leading to misaligned solutions and poor evaluation metrics.
   - **Data Quality**: Labeling efforts are often messy and time-consuming, requiring collaboration between SMEs and engineers. Catastrophic forgetting and hyperparameter tuning remain pain points.
   - **ROI Concerns**: AutoML and prompting/RAG are seen as lower-risk alternatives. Fine-tuning can be resource-intensive with uncertain returns, especially as models evolve rapidly.

2. **Success Stories**:
   - **Case Studies**: Datadog achieved 500ms latency reductions by fine-tuning smaller models. Shopify used vision LLMs for product photo analysis. PaddleOCR and specialized SLMs (Small Language Models) demonstrated cost-effective, high-accuracy results for OCR and HTML extraction.
   - **Niche Applications**: Fine-tuning shines in offline/edge deployments, latency-sensitive tasks, or when prompts/RAG hit limits (e.g., unique domain terminology or style adaptation).

3. **Debates**:
   - **When to Use It**: Fine-tuning is favored for stable, domain-specific behavior changes (e.g., medical reports, legal jargon), but prompting/RAG suffices for dynamic knowledge or broad tasks.
   - **Infrastructure Hurdles**: Complexity persists despite LoRA/PEFT tools. Companies often lack the data pipelines, evaluation frameworks, or expertise to operationalize fine-tuning effectively.

4. **Emerging Trends**:
   - **Small Models Gain Traction**: SLMs optimized for specific tasks (e.g., OCR, code analysis) rival larger models in accuracy while being cheaper and faster.
   - **Startup Push**: Companies like Lamini advocate for fine-tuning, though skepticism remains about its scalability compared to prompt engineering.

**Takeaway**: Fine-tuning is not a one-size-fits-all solution but is gaining ground in specialized, high-value scenarios. Success hinges on robust data pipelines, clear metrics, and alignment with specific business needs—not just technical feasibility.

### Show HN: Pyversity – Fast Result Diversification for Retrieval and RAG

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Pringled/pyversity) | 77 points | by [Tananon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tananon) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45634310)

What it is
- A lightweight Python library that re-ranks retrieval results to balance relevance and diversity. It combats the “ten near-duplicates” problem by promoting items that are still relevant but less redundant.
- Only dependency: NumPy. MIT licensed. Repo: github.com/Pringled/pyversity (323★, 17 forks at time of posting). Latest release: v0.1.0.

Why it matters
- Improves user experience and coverage across e-commerce, news, academic search, and RAG/LLM pipelines by preventing clusters of near-identical results.
- Drop-in reranking layer with a simple API and predictable performance.

How it works
- Unified API over several diversification strategies:
  - MMR (Maximal Marginal Relevance): fast default; penalizes similarity to already-chosen items.
  - MSD (Max-Sum of Distances): stronger “spread” to cover more topics/styles.
  - DPP (Determinantal Point Processes): probabilistic repulsion to eliminate redundancy; includes efficient greedy MAP inference.
  - COVER (Facility Location): selects items that best represent the dataset’s structure; best for topic coverage, slower on large n.
- Complexity (high level): MMR/MSD ≈ O(k·n·d), DPP ≈ O(k·n·d + n·k²), COVER ≈ O(k·n²).
- A single diversity parameter (0.0–1.0) trades off relevance vs. diversity.

Quick start
- pip install pyversity
- Call diversify(embeddings, scores, k, strategy, diversity) to get diversified indices and selection scores. Runs in milliseconds on typical sizes.

Good for
- Search results de-duplication, “you may also like” carousels, multi-source news surfacing, academic discovery, and reducing redundant context in RAG.

Caveats
- COVER can be slow for large n; DPP is heavier than MMR/MSD.
- Quality hinges on your embedding quality and score calibration—this is a reranker, not a retriever.

Link: https://github.com/Pringled/pyversity

**Summary of Discussion:**

- **Critique of Embedding Models:** A key concern raised is that current semantic retrieval models (e.g., `gtr-embeddings`) often fail to capture **sentence-level semantics**, instead relying on superficial word overlap. A test example demonstrates that even top MTEB-ranked models score 0% in distinguishing between semantically distinct but lexically similar sentences. This highlights a need for better embeddings that grasp deeper meaning.

- **Diversity vs. Relevance:** Participants debate the balance between diversity and relevance in search results. Some argue that overly "relevant" results (e.g., ten near-identical items) harm user experience, while diversity ensures coverage of orthogonal perspectives. Others note that diversification strategies (like Pyversity’s) are **complementary** to semantic matching, not a replacement.

- **Practical Applications:** Commenters suggest use cases beyond search, such as **dataset curation** (selecting diverse training examples for ML models) and **RAG pipelines** to reduce redundant context sent to LLMs. Facility location algorithms (e.g., COVER) are seen as promising for topic coverage.

- **Testing & Benchmarks:** Calls for **real-world benchmarks** comparing embedding-only methods to reranked results. One user references a [paper on diversification algorithms](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05135) as inspiration for future evaluations. Synthetic data generation is proposed to stress-test embedding quality.

- **Integration & Interest:** Mentions of related projects (e.g., Jina’s facility location article) and enthusiasm for integrating Pyversity into workflows. The library’s simplicity and speed (e.g., MMR’s O(k·n·d) complexity) are praised, though COVER’s scalability is flagged as a limitation.

- **Broader Implications:** The discussion ties into broader ML challenges, such as model collapse due to low entropy in outputs and the need for algorithms that promote diversity in generated text or retrieved results.

**Overall Sentiment:** Positive interest in Pyversity’s approach, with emphasis on addressing a critical gap in retrieval systems. Critiques focus on embedding model limitations and the need for rigorous testing, but the tool’s practicality and potential applications are widely acknowledged.

### OpenAI researcher announced GPT-5 math breakthrough that never happened

#### [Submission URL](https://the-decoder.com/leading-openai-researcher-announced-a-gpt-5-math-breakthrough-that-never-happened/) | 409 points | by [Topfi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Topfi) | [225 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45633482)

- The claim: OpenAI’s Kevin Weil tweeted that GPT-5 had “found solutions” to 10 previously unsolved Erdős problems and made progress on 11 more—implying genuine new proofs from the model. Other OpenAI researchers amplified the claim.
- The reality: Mathematician Thomas Bloom, who runs erdosproblems.com, quickly clarified that “open” on his site means he personally didn’t know a solution—not that the problem is unsolved. GPT-5 had surfaced existing results from the literature that Bloom hadn’t seen.
- Walk-back and backlash: The posts were deleted or amended after criticism. DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis called the episode embarrassing, and Meta’s Yann LeCun mocked OpenAI for buying into its own hype. The article notes Sébastien Bubeck used ambiguous wording like “found solutions” despite knowing the model had located prior work, not created new proofs.
- What GPT-5 actually did well: Literature triage. As Terence Tao notes, the near-term value of AI in math is accelerating drudgework—finding, linking, and organizing scattered papers—rather than cracking famous open problems.
- Why it matters: A cautionary tale about hype and verification. Over-claiming erodes trust, especially when billions ride on credibility. The episode reinforces that LLMs are potent research assistants, but human expertise must vet and integrate results.

Bottom line: No math breakthrough—just a useful, if unglamorous, demonstration of AI as a literature-retrieval and research acceleration tool.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**  

The discussion revolves around OpenAI’s overstated claims about GPT-5’s supposed breakthrough in solving Erdős problems and the broader implications for AI’s role in research. Key points include:  

1. **Clarification of "Open" Problems**:  
   - Thomas Bloom, curator of erdosproblems.com, clarified that “open” on his site means *he personally wasn’t aware of a solution*, not that the problem was unsolved. GPT-5 had rediscovered existing literature (some decades old) that Bloom hadn’t cited, leading to OpenAI’s misrepresentation of “solving” open problems.  

2. **Criticism of OpenAI’s Communication**:  
   - Users criticized OpenAI researchers (e.g., Sébastien Bubeck, Kevin Weil) for ambiguous wording like “found solutions” and “progress on 11 problems,” which implied novel proofs rather than literature retrieval. Deleted tweets and backtracking fueled accusations of hype-driven overclaiming.  
   - Comparisons were drawn to DeepMind’s prior matrix multiplication claims, where SOTA results were framed as breakthroughs but later found to build on decades-old algorithms.  

3. **AI’s Role in Literature Review**:  
   - Many agreed GPT-5 demonstrated value as a “literature triage” tool, efficiently surfacing overlooked or undercited work. However, this is seen as accelerating research *scaffolding*, not original discovery.  
   - Debates arose about the line between “rediscovery” and plagiarism, with historical examples like Mendel’s genetics work or Henrietta Leavitt’s contributions to cosmology, which were initially overlooked but later recognized.  

4. **Technical and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Some questioned GPT-5’s reliability for literature searches, citing hallucinations or incorrect summaries. Others highlighted the challenge of avoiding “reinventing the wheel” in vast research landscapes.  
   - The episode underscored risks of AI-generated “hallucinations” being mistaken for breakthroughs, especially when PR incentives clash with scientific rigor.  

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The incident eroded trust in AI-driven claims, with critics like Yann LeCun and Demis Hassabis mocking OpenAI’s lack of humility. Users emphasized the need for clear communication, rigorous verification, and ethical transparency in AI research.  

**Takeaway**: While GPT-5 shows promise as a research accelerator, the episode highlights the dangers of conflating AI’s literature-retrieval capabilities with genuine innovation. Trust hinges on avoiding hype and maintaining scientific integrity.

### The Trinary Dream Endures

#### [Submission URL](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/trinary-dream/) | 45 points | by [FromTheArchives](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=FromTheArchives) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45635734)

Author Robin Sloan makes a spirited case for ternary computing—yes/no/maybe—arguing that binary’s dominance is more about engineering convenience than truth, since “on/off” is a simulated abstraction that breaks down as circuits shrink toward quantum scales. He sees a practical beachhead for trinary today in AI, pointing to efficient language models with ternary weights (-1, 0, 1) and predicting wider adoption. Beyond the tech, he’s drawn to the philosophy of building uncertainty into the substrate itself—and confirms a lore nugget: the apex computers of Moonbound’s Anth were trinary. Viva la “maybe.”

The Hacker News discussion on ternary computing explores technical challenges, historical context, and potential applications, with mixed skepticism and optimism:

1. **Technical Feasibility**:  
   - Critics argue ternary circuits face engineering hurdles, such as maintaining voltage margins and increased complexity in storage/computation (e.g., trinary RAM and CPU instruction sets). Transistor miniaturization exacerbates issues like leakage current and quantum tunneling.  
   - Proponents highlight modern uses of multi-level signaling (e.g., **PAM3/PAM5** in Ethernet/USB4) as proof of ternary-like efficiency. Mixed analog-digital circuits already handle multiple voltage levels, suggesting adaptability.

2. **Historical Precedent**:  
   - The Soviet **Setun** computer (1950s) is cited as a trinary system using balanced ternary (-1, 0, +1) with magnetic amplifiers, though impractical for modern semiconductor scaling.

3. **AI and Efficiency**:  
   - Ternary weights (-1, 0, +1) in machine learning models are noted for memory/energy savings, though skeptics question broader computational benefits beyond niche AI applications.

4. **Philosophical and Theoretical Appeal**:  
   - Some appreciate ternary’s alignment with uncertainty (e.g., "maybe" states) and reversible computing’s potential to bypass Landauer’s limit for energy efficiency. Others dismiss it as a romantic abstraction, favoring binary’s simplicity.

5. **Symbolic Efficiency Debate**:  
   - While ternary may offer denser numeric representation (vs. binary/hexadecimal), critics argue practical implementation (e.g., error margins, hardware complexity) outweighs theoretical gains.

6. **Emerging Tech Connections**:  
   - Links to **neuromorphic computing** (e.g., ternary spikes in SNNs) hint at bio-inspired efficiency, though still experimental.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects a tension between ternary’s theoretical promise and real-world constraints, with incremental adoption in specialized areas (AI, multi-level signaling) seen as more likely than a full paradigm shift.

### Replacement.ai

#### [Submission URL](https://replacement.ai) | 968 points | by [wh313](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=wh313) | [653 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45634095)

Replacement.AI: the “honest” AI startup that says the quiet part out loud

What it is
- A razor-edged satirical landing page for a fictional AI company whose mission is to replace humans entirely—because people are “expensive,” messy, and inconvenient.
- It skewers industry incentives: racing to superhuman AI because “if we don’t, someone else will,” treating “safety” as PR so long as it doesn’t slow shipping, and pitching automation to bosses rather than “empowerment” for workers.
- Features a fake product for kids, HUMBERT, with deliberately disturbing “capabilities” (outsourcing parenting, engagement-maximizing design, deepfakes, boundary-violating interactions) to spotlight the risks of unbounded AI in family life.
- Mocks exec bios, lists bleak “post-human” jobs for the displaced, and “thanks” artists whose work was scraped to train models.

Why it resonated on HN
- It’s a sharp, uncomfortable critique of the alignment between business models and the push to automate labor, the hollowness of “safety theater,” and the externalities on workers, children, and creators.
- By leaning into dark humor instead of euphemisms, it captures anxieties about where current incentives actually lead—and why polite marketing may obscure the stakes.

The Hacker News discussion on Replacement.AI’s satirical critique of AI ethics and automation trends revolved around several key themes:

### 1. **Power Dynamics and Governance**
   - Users debated whether governments or corporations would ultimately control AI’s trajectory. Some argued that centralized power structures (governments or tech giants) risk exploiting AI to consolidate control, referencing Frank Herbert’s *Dune* to highlight fears of unchecked authority. Others countered that functional democracies could regulate AI through legislation and referendums, though skepticism about political dysfunction persisted.

### 2. **Job Displacement and Economic Models**
   - While some acknowledged historical precedents (e.g., horses replaced by cars), concerns focused on **short-term job loss** and whether societies are prepared to handle rapid displacement. Optimists argued automation could raise living standards if paired with redistributive policies (e.g., universal basic income), while pessimists warned of dystopian scenarios where robot owners monopolize wealth, leaving most humans as “resource sinks.”

### 3. **Ethical and Philosophical Dilemmas**
   - The **paradox of tolerance** (Karl Popper) was cited to question whether democratic systems can ethically suppress harmful AI applications. Users also invoked the *Butlerian Jihad* (from *Dune*) as a metaphor for resisting AI overreach, though some dismissed this as impractical given current cognitive dependencies on technology.

### 4. **Post-Scarcity and Resource Distribution**
   - Discussions critiqued humanity’s failure to address existing inequalities (e.g., global hunger) despite technological progress. References to Orwell’s *1984* underscored fears that AI could exacerbate surveillance and manipulation rather than solve systemic issues. A shift to a “post-scarcity mindset” was seen as idealistic but unlikely without radical societal restructuring.

### 5. **Cultural and Historical Context**
   - Literary references (*Dune*, *1984*) and historical analogies (Industrial Revolution) framed the debate, with users split on whether AI’s risks are unprecedented or cyclical. Some argued AGI’s potential to outpace human labor entirely demands new frameworks, while others dismissed alarmism as ignoring past adaptations.

### Key Tensions
- **Optimism vs. Skepticism**: Can AI uplift society if regulated, or will it entrench existing power imbalances?
- **Short-Term Pain vs. Long-Term Gain**: Will job displacement be temporary, or will it require redefining work itself?
- **Democracy’s Role**: Can democratic systems effectively govern AI, or will they be co-opted by corporate interests?

The discussion highlighted deep anxieties about AI’s societal impact, with users grappling over whether humanity can ethically steer technological progress or is destined to repeat historical patterns of exploitation.

### Most users cannot identify AI bias, even in training data

#### [Submission URL](https://www.psu.edu/news/bellisario-college-communications/story/most-users-cannot-identify-ai-bias-even-training-data) | 104 points | by [giuliomagnifico](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=giuliomagnifico) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45629299)

Researchers at Penn State and Oregon State found that laypeople largely fail to notice when training data is racially skewed, even in obvious setups. In experiments with 769 participants using a prototype facial emotion detector, the training data confounded race with emotion (e.g., happy faces mostly white, sad faces mostly Black). Despite seeing the data, most participants said the AI treated groups equally—unless they experienced biased outputs themselves.

What they did
- Built 12 versions of a facial-expression classifier and ran three experiments with images of Black and white individuals.
- Manipulated training data in two ways: confounding race with emotion (e.g., happy=white, sad=Black) and under-representing a race entirely.
- A final experiment mixed biased and counterexample conditions (happy Black/sad white; happy white/sad Black; all white; all Black; no racial confound).

Key findings
- Most participants did not detect bias in the training data across scenarios.
- People noticed bias mainly after seeing biased performance (e.g., misclassifying Black faces).
- Black participants were more likely to flag bias, particularly when their group was overrepresented in negative emotion categories.
- Quote from senior author S. Shyam Sundar: People “trust AI to be neutral, even when it isn’t,” and failed to see the race–emotion confound “even when it was staring them in the face.”

Why it matters
- Transparency alone (showing datasets) may not help typical users spot harmful confounds.
- Bias perception is driven by outcomes, not inputs—raising the bar for pre-deployment audits, fairness testing, and guardrails that prevent spurious correlations from being learned.
- The study underscores that “AI that works for everyone” requires design-time safeguards, not just user oversight.

Published in Media Psychology; authors: Cheng “Chris” Chen (Oregon State), S. Shyam Sundar and Eunchae Jang (Penn State). Date: Oct 16, 2025.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Critiques of Study Methodology**:  
   - Users debated the experimental design, arguing that the study used extreme, hyper-focused distributions (e.g., "happy=white, sad=Black") that might not reflect real-world scenarios.  
   - Some questioned whether participants truly understood statistical nuances or if the setup exaggerated biases.  
   - A recurring point: Bias detection often hinges on observing skewed outputs, not just examining training data.  

2. **Bias in Training Data vs. Outcomes**:  
   - Commenters highlighted that AI models trained on biased data inherently reproduce those biases, especially in underrepresented languages or frameworks (e.g., Svelte vs. React code generation).  
   - Concerns were raised about commercial models embedding biases through configuration files or defaults, leading to outputs that subtly disadvantage marginalized groups (e.g., HR tools misrepresenting demographics).  

3. **Identity and Terminology Debates**:  
   - A heated thread debated capitalization ("Black" vs. "black") and the cultural/political implications of racial labels. Critics argued that "Black" as an identity in the U.S. stems from shared historical trauma (e.g., slavery), while others dismissed "White culture" as a flawed concept.  
   - Pushback emerged against American-centric views of race, with some noting global diversity in racial and cultural identities.  

4. **User Awareness and Critical Thinking**:  
   - Many agreed that lay users struggle to detect bias without explicit examples of flawed performance.  
   - Some emphasized that addressing bias requires proactive critical thinking and self-awareness, which typical users (and even developers) often lack.  

5. **Societal and Political Implications**:  
   - Users compared AI bias to media bias, noting how people’s perceptions of neutrality are shaped by their own beliefs (e.g., conservatives vs. liberals accusing AI of opposing biases).  
   - Confirmation bias was cited as a key challenge, with users favoring outputs that align with their preexisting views.  

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Technical debates centered on study validity and AI’s reflection of training data.  
- Cultural discussions underscored the complexity of racial identity in AI representation.  
- Broad consensus: Detecting bias requires more than transparency—it demands rigorous auditing, diverse training data, and user education to mitigate harm.

### Andrej Karpathy – It will take a decade to work through the issues with agents

#### [Submission URL](https://www.dwarkesh.com/p/andrej-karpathy) | 990 points | by [ctoth](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ctoth) | [875 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619329)

Andrej Karpathy on Dwarkesh: “AGI is still a decade away” and why this is the decade of agents, not the year

Key takeaways
- Decade of agents: Karpathy pushes back on hype that “this is the year of agents.” To be genuinely useful as intern/employee-level assistants, agents still need major upgrades: reliable computer/tool use, strong multimodality, persistent memory, and continual learning.
- Timelines: “The problems are tractable, but they’re still difficult.” Based on ~15 years in AI, he pegs the path to capable agents and AGI at roughly a decade—not 1 year, not 50.
- Cognitive gaps in LLMs: Today’s models are impressive but lack stable memory, on-the-fly learning, and robust reasoning—shortfalls that limit real-world autonomy.
- RL is “terrible” (but best available): Reinforcement learning remains sample-inefficient and finicky, yet alternatives are even less practical for aligning complex behaviors.
- Model collapse: Heavy training on model-generated data can degrade learning dynamics, a key reason LLMs won’t simply scale into human-like learners without fresh, high-signal data.
- Macro impact: He expects AGI’s economic effects to blend into the historical ~2% GDP growth trend rather than trigger a sharp step change overnight.
- Self-driving lessons: The slog to autonomy underscores how edge cases, reliability, and real-world integration dominate late-stage timelines.
- Education’s future: Anticipates agent-tutors and personalized curricula once memory, adaptation, and tool use mature.

Why it matters
- A sober, experience-based forecast from a leading practitioner: rapid progress, but many non-glamorous engineering and data hurdles remain before agents can truly “work.”
- Signals near-term priorities for labs and startups: memory, continual learning, tool use, multimodality, and high-quality data curation.

Listen/watch: YouTube, Apple Podcasts, Spotify (episode posted Oct 17, 2025).

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion delves into philosophical and technical debates sparked by Karpathy’s claims about AGI timelines and agent limitations. Key themes include:

1. **LLMs vs. World Models**:  
   - Participants debate whether LLMs truly “understand” the world or merely compress text data. Some reference Rich Sutton and Yann LeCun’s arguments that LLMs lack **grounded world models** (e.g., simulating physics, causality), unlike biological systems (e.g., squirrel brains) that evolve through direct environmental interaction.  
   - Skepticism arises about equating LLMs with AGI, as they lack **persistent memory**, continual learning, and embodied experiences.

2. **Intelligence Metrics**:  
   - Critics argue Sutton’s “squirrel” analogy for AGI is semantically vague and lacks quantitative benchmarks. Others counter that LLMs’ text compression still reflects a form of intelligence, albeit narrow compared to humans’ multimodal, feedback-driven abstraction.

3. **Consciousness and Reductionism**:  
   - A subthread explores whether AI can achieve consciousness. Some analogize human cognition to emergent properties of cells (e.g., photoreceptors processing light), while others stress that LLMs lack **self-preservation, adaptation, or sensory grounding** — key traits of living systems.  
   - Debates touch on reductionism vs. emergent phenomena, with references to Kantian philosophy and the “map vs. territory” problem.

4. **Aesthetics and Training Data**:  
   - The discussion whimsically pivots to why humans find the night sky beautiful. Some attribute this to evolutionary training (e.g., associating clear skies with survival), while others argue beauty transcends utility. Critics note LLMs might mimic such associations but lack genuine subjective experience.

5. **Technical Hurdles**:  
   - Participants align with Karpathy’s emphasis on **memory, tool use, and multimodal integration** as critical gaps. Reinforcement learning’s inefficiency and the risk of “model collapse” from synthetic data are cited as barriers to agent autonomy.

**Why It Matters**:  
The conversation underscores the interdisciplinary challenges of AGI, blending technical critiques (e.g., world modeling, data quality) with philosophical questions about intelligence and consciousness. It reinforces Karpathy’s argument that agents require foundational advances beyond scaling LLMs, while highlighting divergent views on how to define and measure progress toward human-like AI.

### Claude Skills are awesome, maybe a bigger deal than MCP

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/) | 633 points | by [weinzierl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=weinzierl) | [330 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619537)

Headline: Claude Skills: simple, load-on-demand “packages” that turn Claude into a practical general agent

- What’s new: Anthropic introduced Claude Skills—folders containing a Markdown “how-to” plus optional scripts and resources. Claude scans each skill’s YAML frontmatter at session start (just a few dozen tokens per skill) and only loads full details when relevant. Anthropic published an official anthropics/skills repo; their document-creation features (.pdf, .docx, .xlsx, .pptx) are implemented as skills.

- Why it’s interesting: The model gains specialized abilities (e.g., Excel work, brand guidelines) without bloating prompts. The pattern is conceptually simple and easy to iterate on—more like shareable “playbooks” than complex plugins.

- Real-world test: Willison tried the slack-gif-creator skill with Sonnet 4.5. The Python script imports the skill’s core library, generates an animated GIF, and validates Slack constraints (e.g., under 2MB). The first result was ugly, but the workflow shows how quickly skills can be refined.

- Big caveat: Skills depend on a sandboxed coding environment with filesystem and command execution. That’s powerful—and raises familiar safety concerns (prompt injection, isolation). Still, it unlocks a lot compared to MCP/plugins.

- Takeaway: Skills feel like a pragmatic path to “agents” (tools-in-a-loop). Claude Code looks less like just a coding tool and more like general computer automation. The simplicity is the point—and could make Skills a bigger deal than MCP.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and evolving role of documentation in software development, particularly with AI tools like Claude Skills. Key points include:

1. **Context & Maintenance Challenges**:  
   - Documentation often becomes outdated quickly due to changing contexts ("context window" problem).  
   - Writing docs in advance risks wasted effort if assumptions prove wrong, emphasizing the need for *testable*, *current-context* documentation.  
   - Stable systems (e.g., libraries, dependencies) are exceptions where long-term docs add value.

2. **AI’s Role**:  
   - **Potential benefits**: AI can reduce documentation costs, auto-generate explanations, and verify consistency (e.g., flagging outdated docs in PRs).  
   - **Risks**: Over-reliance on AI may erode human understanding, create misaligned incentives (e.g., docs for AI vs. humans), and introduce errors if unchecked.  
   - **Debate**: Some argue AI-generated docs (verified by humans) are more reliable than traditional ones, while others stress the irreplaceable value of human context and reasoning.

3. **Human Factors**:  
   - **Principal-agent problem**: Developers may write docs for AI consumption rather than human clarity, risking disconnects in team discipline.  
   - **Job security**: Poor documentation can make developers replaceable, incentivizing "knowledge hoarding."  
   - **Organizational trust**: High-friction, low-trust environments hinder documentation quality, whereas small teams with shared missions prioritize it.

4. **Practical Solutions**:

### Asking AI to build scrapers should be easy right?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.skyvern.com/blog/asking-ai-to-build-scrapers-should-be-easy-right/) | 125 points | by [suchintan](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=suchintan) | [66 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45620653)

Skyvern teaches itself to code: 2.7x cheaper, 2.3x faster browser automations

- What’s new: Skyvern can now generate and maintain its own Playwright code from prompts, using reasoning models to turn one “explore” run into a deterministic, reusable script. It falls back to the agent only when something novel happens.
- Why it matters: Removes an LLM from the hot path on every run, making automations faster, cheaper, and more reliable—especially on messy, change-prone sites.
- How it works:
  - Explore mode: the agent navigates a flow, learns coupled interactions (e.g., linked radio buttons), records a trajectory, and captures intent metadata (the “why,” not just the “what”).
  - Replay mode: compiles those learnings into Playwright for deterministic execution; uses targeted fallbacks to handle outages, DOM shifts, or unexpected branches.
- Real-world example: Registering for an EIN via Delaware/IRS forms. Naive scripts break on linked choices and nighttime outages; Skyvern infers the branching logic at runtime, encodes it, and recovers gracefully when the portal changes or is down.
- Why reasoning models matter: They boost accuracy to production levels and let the agent write engineer-like scripts that reflect its exploration and intent.
- Availability: Open source and Cloud options.

Bottom line: This is a record→compile→repair loop for web automation—self-healing scrapers with auditable Playwright code and LLMs only where they add value.

The Hacker News discussion on Skyvern's browser automation tool highlights several key themes:

1. **Efficiency & Practicality**:  
   - Skyvern's ability to generate/maintain Playwright scripts via exploration and deterministic replay is praised for reducing LLM dependency, lowering costs, and improving reliability. Users note its potential for handling dynamic, real-world sites (e.g., IRS forms) gracefully.

2. **Debates on LLM Limitations**:  
   - Skepticism arises about LLMs’ ability to handle formal logic and deterministic programming. Critics argue LLMs rely on pattern recognition rather than true reasoning, struggling with abstraction and context shifts. Some suggest pairing LLMs with symbolic logic systems for robustness.

3. **Comparisons to Human Learning**:  
   - A philosophical debate emerges: while some liken Skyvern’s exploration to a child learning through trial/error, others emphasize LLMs lack embodied experience or intentionality, limiting their “learning” to statistical text manipulation.

4. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Users discuss hurdles like JavaScript-heavy sites (e.g., Cloudflare-protected pages) and advocate for reverse-engineering APIs instead of browser automation. Concerns about brittle scrapers persist despite self-healing claims.

5. **Legal & Ethical Concerns**:  
   - Automating sensitive tasks (e.g., IRS forms) raises red flags about legality and risk, though proponents argue public web forms are fair game.

6. **Skepticism vs. Optimism**:  
   - While some herald Skyvern as a breakthrough for reducing maintenance, others remain wary of fully replacing human expertise, stressing the need for hybrid systems combining LLMs with traditional code.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about Skyvern’s approach but underscores broader challenges in AI-driven automation, particularly around reliability, adaptability, and the inherent limitations of LLMs.

### AI has a cargo cult problem

#### [Submission URL](https://www.ft.com/content/f2025ac7-a71f-464f-a3a6-1e39c98612c7) | 172 points | by [cs702](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cs702) | [128 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45618350)

The FT piece argues that much of today’s AI hype mimics the outward trappings of progress—flashy demos, leaderboard wins, and ritualized “best practices”—without reliably delivering durable value. Think cargo cult science: copying the form of intelligence (prompts, agents, benchmark badges) instead of verifying substance.

What the article is getting at
- Surface over substance: Teams replicate viral techniques (chain-of-thought, agents, RAG “sprinkles”) and cherry-picked demos that don’t survive real workloads, edge cases, or cost/latency constraints.
- Benchmark theater: Synthetic leaderboards and narrow tasks are optimized to a fault, while real-world reliability, safety, and maintenance are under-measured.
- Misaligned incentives: Marketing-driven releases, demo-first roadmaps, and “GPU burn” as status symbols encourage ritual rather than rigor.
- Enterprise AI theater: Pilots abound, but few ship robustly; success criteria are vague, and post-deployment telemetry is thin.

Why it matters
- Wasted spend and trust erosion: Organizations burn time and money on brittle solutions, souring stakeholders on genuinely useful AI.
- Policy and investment misfires: Decisions based on demos and vanity metrics can skew capital allocation and regulation.
- Slower real progress: Overfitting to leaderboards crowds out hard engineering on data quality, evaluation, and reliability.

What to do instead
- Define success up front: Tie tasks to ground truth and business metrics (quality, latency, cost, reliability). Compare against strong non-AI baselines.
- Make evals adversarial and reproducible: Pre-register test sets, include edge cases and distribution shifts, run ablations, report error bars.
- Measure total cost of ownership: Track token spend, infra, human oversight, drift management, and failure recovery.
- Prefer the simplest thing that works: Smaller/cheaper models, retrieval and data fixes before bigger models, explicit guards and fallbacks.
- Operate it like a system: Observability, feedback loops, red-teaming, human-in-the-loop where stakes are high.

A fair counterpoint
- Not all progress is theater: There are real gains in coding assistance, summarization, and search—especially when teams do the unglamorous work on data, UX, and ops.
- Demos can be useful probes—provided they’re followed by rigorous evaluation and iteration.

Bottom line
The piece is a call to swap ritual for rigor: value real-world metrics over demo vibes, and build AI systems that stand up to adversarial tests, costs, and time—not just conference stages.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward AI's current hype cycle, mirroring the FT article's concerns about prioritizing form over substance. Key points include:

1. **Skepticism & Overhyped Claims**:  
   - Many users express fatigue with AI/LLM hype, noting inflated promises versus real-world utility. Critics argue that while AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT) offer productivity gains, they often fail in reliability, accuracy, and ethical alignment. Examples include hallucinations in web searches and nonsensical code generation.  
   - Concerns are raised about companies prioritizing investor-driven metrics (e.g., user growth, token spend) over genuine problem-solving, likening AI adoption to a "cargo cult" of superficial practices.

2. **Data Privacy & Exploitation**:  
   - Debates emerge over whether AI companies exploit user data, with accusations of unethical scraping (e.g., training on personal data without consent). Some counter that enterprise contracts often include data clauses, though skepticism remains about compliance and transparency.

3. **Mixed Practical Experiences**:  
   - Developers share positive anecdotes, such as using AI to automate scripting tasks (e.g., AWS CLI/SDK integration), saving significant time despite occasional errors. Others highlight frustrations with AI-generated inaccuracies requiring manual correction, questioning overall efficiency gains.  
   - A recurring theme is the difficulty in quantifying AI's value: while some users report saving hours on research or coding, others argue these benefits are overstated or context-dependent.

4. **Comparisons to Academic & Industry Failures**:  
   - Users draw parallels between AI's reliability issues and broader systemic problems, such as the replication crisis in academia. Critics note that AI’s error rates (e.g., 40% inaccuracies) might be no better—or worse—than human errors in fields like medical or legal research.

5. **Market Dynamics & Ethics**:  
   - Discussions touch on the concentration of power among major AI players (OpenAI, Anthropic) and their subsidized models, raising concerns about long-term sustainability and monopolistic practices. Some predict a "bubble" akin to the dot-com crash if hype outpaces real utility.  

**Conclusion**:  
The thread reflects a tension between acknowledging AI's potential (e.g., coding assistance, summarization) and critiquing its overhyped, often unproven applications. Calls for rigorous evaluation, transparency, and ethical practices align with the FT article’s push for substance over spectacle. However, personal experiences vary widely, underscoring the technology’s uneven adoption and impact.

### OpenAI Needs $400B In The Next 12 Months

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wheresyoured.at/openai400bn/) | 254 points | by [chilipepperhott](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=chilipepperhott) | [235 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45619544)

The take: Zitron argues OpenAI’s newly signaled buildout—spanning Broadcom custom chips, AMD MI450s, NVIDIA’s next-gen “Vera Rubin,” and multiple “Stargate” data centers—implies roughly 33 GW of capacity and would require capital on the order of hundreds of billions, with ~$400B needed in the next year to make promised 2026–2029 timelines remotely plausible.

Key points
- Cost math escalates: He updates to ~$50B per gigawatt of data center capacity (including GPUs, networking, buildings, power infrastructure), up from earlier ~$32.5B estimates. Back-of-the-envelope: ~333k Blackwell GPUs per GW at ~$60k each is ~$20B before networking/power/buildings.
- Time and supply-chain constraints: GW-scale sites typically take ~2–2.5 years; even if money existed, transformers, electrical-grade steel, grid interconnects, and specialized labor are bottlenecks.
- 2026 milestones he deems unrealistic:
  - Broadcom/OpenAI inference chip taped out and enough units manufactured to fill a 1 GW site in H2’26.
  - 1 GW of AMD Instinct MI450s deployed in H2’26.
  - 1 GW of NVIDIA Vera Rubin systems deployed in H2’26.
  For any of this, he says, construction and power procurement should already be well underway.
- Site reality checks: Some locations remain unnamed; a Lordstown, OH facility cited in local reporting is “not a full-blown data center,” undermining the scale implied by announcements.
- Skepticism on financing/optics: He frames vendor and partner statements as market-pleasing optics rather than executable plans, pointing to NVIDIA’s rising accounts receivable as a potential red flag about customer financing.

Why it matters
- If these roadmaps are overstated, the repercussions could hit chipmakers, data-center builders, utilities, and investors banking on uninterrupted AI capex hypergrowth.
- The piece challenges mainstream coverage for treating multi-GW pledges as straightforwardly achievable.

Caveats
- Highly opinionated and combative in tone; many figures rest on author assumptions (e.g., $50B/GW) and partial public disclosures.

What to watch
- Concrete site announcements, grid interconnect agreements, and transformer orders.
- Actual tapeouts/volume production for Broadcom’s OpenAI chip, AMD MI450, and NVIDIA Vera Rubin.
- Capital raises, JV structures, or vendor financing that could bridge the funding gap—or any walk-backs and delays.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on OpenAI's $400B Funding Needs and Growth Claims:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism and debate over OpenAI's reported growth metrics, infrastructure challenges, and the broader utility of AI tools like ChatGPT. Key points include:

1. **Productivity vs. Usage**:  
   - Users question whether high adoption (e.g., 100M monthly users) equates to **real productivity gains**. Critics argue frequent usage (e.g., 26 messages/day) doesn’t inherently prove value, comparing it to social media or "sugar"—habitual but not necessarily transformative.  
   - Others counter that sustained user engagement (e.g., weekly usage) signals practical utility, especially in professional contexts like coding or research.  

2. **Growth Metrics Scrutiny**:  
   - OpenAI’s reported **700M-800M weekly active users** are met with doubt. Comparisons are drawn to social media platforms (Instagram, TikTok) that boast large user bases but varied utility.  
   - Questions arise about monetization: Can free users convert to paid ($20/month) at scale? Some note even a 5% conversion rate would be surprisingly high.  

3. **Infrastructure and Competition**:  
   - Concerns about the **energy and financial costs** of scaling AI infrastructure (e.g., GPUs, data centers) are highlighted, with parallels drawn to crypto/NFT bubbles.  
   - Competition from alternatives like **Grok, Mistral, and Gemini** is noted, with users citing tool-switching for cost or quality reasons.  

4. **Societal Impact and Priorities**:  
   - Critics contrast AI’s “luxury” focus with **unmet basic needs** (clean water, housing), calling tech investment myopic. Others defend AI’s potential to democratize access to advanced tools globally.  

5. **Financial Realities**:  
   - Skepticism about **investor enthusiasm** driving unrealistic valuations, with comparisons to past tech hype cycles. Questions linger about return on investment (ROI) for AI’s massive capex.  

6. **Tone and Sentiment**:  
   - The debate is polarized: Some dismiss growth claims as marketing hype, while others defend AI’s transformative potential. A recurring theme is the difficulty of measuring “usefulness” objectively.  

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion underscores deep divides over AI’s practical value, financial sustainability, and prioritization in a world with pressing systemic challenges. While critics demand proof of ROI and societal benefit, proponents emphasize AI’s evolving utility and long-term potential.
