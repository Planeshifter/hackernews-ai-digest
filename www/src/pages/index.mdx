### Direct initialization of transformers using larger pretrained ones

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09299) | 44 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38737262)

Researchers at Stanford University have developed a technique called weight subcloning, which allows for the direct initialization of smaller transformer models using weights from larger pretrained models. Training large transformers from scratch can be time-consuming and computationally demanding, so transfer learning is commonly used to initialize models with weights from pretrained models. However, if a pretrained model of the required size is not available, this approach becomes challenging. Weight subcloning addresses this problem by performing an operation on the pretrained model to obtain an initialized scaled-down model. This technique improves training speed and convergence for vision transformers in image classification and language models designed for next token prediction. The researchers achieved up to 4x faster training using weight subcloning compared to random initialization.
