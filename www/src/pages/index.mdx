#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2024/09/01/why-do-so-many-home-robots-still-suck/) | 13 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41481696)

This September marks the 62nd anniversary of "The Jetsons," spotlighting the iconic Rosie the Robot and the ongoing quest for practical home automation. Despite the domestic robot industry evolving significantly since the Roomba's launch 22 years ago, home robots still largely underdeliver on the futuristic promises we envisioned.

Brian Heater explores the complexities behind this reality in his recent article, asserting that while consumer demand is strong, the technology often falls short due to high costs and operational limitations. Although iRobot has successfully sold over 50 million Roombas, other robotic innovations—like lawnmowers and pool cleaners—have yet to capture widespread consumer interest.

Despite ambitious proposals, like Elon Musk's vision of a multifunctional humanoid robot, the challenge remains: creating reliable machines that can tackle multiple tasks effectively without breaking the bank. Experts agree that future robots will likely need to focus on simplified, single-function roles as they lay the groundwork for more sophisticated designs.

The article reflects on the foundation laid by early devices like the Roomba, showing how they challenged expectations and pushed forward the field of robotics, even if their successors still struggle to achieve the multipurpose capabilities imagined in classic sci-fi. As the industry continues to grapple with these challenges, the dream of a fully functional home robot remains tantalizingly just out of reach.

In the discussion following the article on the unfulfilled promise of home robots, several users expressed mixed experiences with current robotic technologies. A user noted that while their Roomba performed well with mapping, it struggled with small objects and deep cleaning, leading to a preference for traditional vacuuming methods. Others shared their positive experiences with Roborock vacuums, which outperformed Roombas in certain tasks.

The complexity of robot mechanics and the challenges of creating machines that can handle household tasks effectively were highlighted. Discussions also included concerns over battery life and repair costs, which can make robotic purchases less appealing. Some participants brought up innovative concepts, such as combining AI advancements with robotics for more sophisticated home assistants, while others suggested more straightforward robots with specific functions, like fetching items or performing laundry tasks.

Overall, participants reflected on the high expectations set by early robotic designs, acknowledging both the potential for future advancements and the limitations imposed by current technology. There was a consensus that while consumer interest exists, the technology still has a long way to go to meet the sci-fi standards set by classics like "The Jetsons."
