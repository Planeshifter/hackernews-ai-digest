### Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say CA Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://themarkup.org/2024/06/12/these-wrongly-arrested-black-men-say-a-california-bill-would-let-police-misuse-face-recognition) | 10 points | by [cdme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cdme) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662980)

The article discusses the concerns of three Black men who were wrongly arrested due to police misuse of face recognition technology. These cases highlight the potential for civil rights violations and unjust consequences for individuals and their families. The men are now speaking out against a California bill that would restrict police from using face recognition as the sole basis for search or arrest, calling for more corroborating evidence.

Despite the bill's passage in the Senate Public Safety Committee, critics argue that a face recognition "match" is not conclusive evidence and can lead to wrongful arrests. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, defends the legislation as a necessary step to prevent such injustices and improve civil rights protections in California.

The use of face recognition technology by law enforcement has raised concerns about accuracy and bias, especially in identifying individuals with dark skin or other underrepresented groups. The reliance on eyewitness testimony, coupled with face recognition results, can further complicate criminal investigations and contribute to wrongful convictions.

The experiences of these men underscore the importance of addressing the pitfalls of face recognition technology and ensuring that individuals are not unjustly targeted or arrested based on flawed or biased algorithms.

The discussion revolves around the argument that human judgment is critical in policing to ensure accuracy and benefit society by addressing errors and maintaining accountability. There is a comparison between human error in decision-making and the flaws of face recognition technology, highlighting the potential consequences of blindly trusting computer algorithms. 

The conversation delves into the issue of automation bias, where individuals have a tendency to rely on automated systems even when they present errors or questionable outcomes. An example from the 80s involving a Navy ship mistaking a commercial CD player for missile signals is used to illustrate the limitations of solely trusting computer systems.

There is a debate about the importance of human judgment versus computer analysis, with one side emphasizing the necessity of human questioning and accountability in decision-making, while the other side acknowledges the benefits of computer technology in certain fields like aviation. Additionally, the discussion touches on the challenges faced by law enforcement in utilizing face recognition technology and the need for a balanced approach that considers both human expertise and technological tools.

### Intel details how Lunar Lake PC chips deliver 120 TOPS

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/06/04/intel_details_lunar_lake_tops/) | 8 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40661112)

Intel detailed how its upcoming Lunar Lake PC chips will deliver a massive 120 TOPS, joining the league of AI powerhouses aiming to redefine the world of AI PCs. The Lunar Lake processors will feature an upgraded NPU, faster graphics core in the GPU, on-package memory, and architectural improvements to reach this remarkable performance milestone. With enhancements like a larger NPU block, increased vector compute power, and improved power efficiency through AI optimization, Intel is set to offer a high AI performance with these chips. Additionally, the CPU's new Lion Cove p-cores and Skymount e-cores promise significant improvements in instructions per clock and throughput for AI workloads. The GPU in the Lunar Lake silicon is touted to be 50% faster than its predecessor, delivering 67 TOPS of performance and up to 80% faster in gaming. The chip will also incorporate on-package LPDDR5 memory, contributing to energy-efficient operations and a significant battery life boost. Intel's Lunar Lake processors are poised to compete with offerings from Qualcomm, AMD, and Apple as the quest to increase TOPS continues in the AI PC industry.

- The first comment by user "_boffin_" references the LPDDR5 memory bandwidth of 6400 Mbps in Samsung's technology and questions how this compares to Intel's TOPS in the Lunar Lake processors.
- In response, user "luyu_wu" explains that the 6400 Mbps is the memory bandwidth per memory channel, typically with a 128-bit width, implying that Apple has significantly higher bandwidth due to width techniques like HBM, suggesting that Lunar Lake might be moving towards that direction.
- User "FloatArtifact" mentions a chart dedicated to GPU comparison.
- User "rowanG077" appreciates the movement towards on-package memory on non-Apple platforms, as it eliminates the need for wide memory buses like in Apple platforms.
