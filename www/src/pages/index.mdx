### LIMO: Less Is More for Reasoning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03387) | 353 points | by [trott](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=trott) | [124 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42991676)

In a groundbreaking study from the world of computational linguistics, researchers have introduced LIMO—an innovative approach to reasoning with large language models that defies conventional thinking about the need for extensive training data. Traditionally, it’s believed that complex tasks demand vast amounts of training data to ensure accuracy. Yet, the team behind LIMO achieved impressive results in mathematical reasoning with a remarkably small dataset, using just 817 training examples. This is a minuscule fraction compared to past methods.

LIMO’s performance is nothing short of revolutionary: the model scored 57.1% on the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) and an astounding 94.8% on the MATH dataset. These results outstrip previous models that required 100 times more training data, underscoring LIMO's significant efficiency and effectiveness.

The researchers propose the "Less-Is-More Reasoning Hypothesis," which suggests that well-developed language models can unlock sophisticated reasoning with minimal, strategically designed teaching examples. This hypothesis reshapes our understanding of how insights are embedded and extracted from pre-trained models, particularly emphasizing that concise demonstrations can serve as powerful cognitive guides.

To foster ongoing advancements, the researchers have made LIMO accessible as an open-source suite, aiming to spur further exploration into data-efficient reasoning. This study not only presents a leap in artificial intelligence capabilities but also opens new pathways for sustainable data usage in future technology developments.

The Hacker News discussion about the LIMO research paper raises several critical insights and debates:

1. **Role of Pre-Trained Models & Data Filtering**:  
   Commenters highlight that the "small" training dataset (817 examples) relied heavily on **pre-existing knowledge** from the underlying model (Qwen-25B). The R1 filtering process distilled 10 million problems into high-quality examples, suggesting the efficiency gains stem from leveraging prior training rather than novel reasoning capabilities. Some compare this to textbooks distilling foundational knowledge for students.

2. **Skepticism About Novelty**:  
   Critics argue the results may overstate innovation, as the approach essentially **distills existing capabilities** of advanced base models. A recurring analogy: using a small, curated dataset is akin to an expert studying a concise textbook—effective but not revolutionary. One user likens it to "climbing Everest with better gear," where progress stems from improved tools (filtered data) rather than fundamentally new methods.

3. **Debates on Efficiency vs. Overfitting**:  
   Concerns arise about whether the small dataset introduces **heavy regularization**, limiting generalizability. Users reference projects like TinyZero and "simple test-time scaling" to highlight alternative data-efficient methods. Others counter that the results validate strategic fine-tuning, emphasizing quality over quantity in training data.

4. **Comparisons to Traditional Methods**:  
   The discussion draws parallels to **compiler design** and educational practices, where progress builds incrementally on prior work (e.g., high-level languages built atop assembly). Similarly, LIMO’s success is framed as optimizing existing model capabilities rather than inventing new reasoning frameworks.

5. **Open Questions and Pragmatic Takeaways**:  
   While some question the paper’s framing (e.g., "Less-Is-More Hypothesis"), others praise its **practical value** for industry applications, where distilling large models into efficient versions is critical. The release of LIMO as open-source is noted as a positive step for further research.

**Key Tension**: The debate centers on whether LIMO represents a breakthrough in reasoning or merely a clever application of data curation on top of powerful base models. While results are impressive, many emphasize that the true innovation lies in data filtering and knowledge distillation, not in "teaching" models to reason from scratch.

### PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01584) | 151 points | by [enum](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=enum) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992336)

In a refreshing twist on traditional AI benchmarks, a new paper, "PhD Knowledge Not Required: A Reasoning Challenge for Large Language Models," proposes a unique test that's designed to assess general reasoning abilities rather than niche, expert-level knowledge. Crafted by Carolyn Jane Anderson and her team, this benchmark draws inspiration from the NPR Sunday Puzzle Challenge, offering tasks that are challenging yet accessible to the general public.

The study highlights significant capability gaps in current AI models that standard benchmarks fail to capture. Notably, even cutting-edge models like OpenAI's outperform established competitors when challenged with these new reasoning tasks. The findings are intriguing: models that excel in specialized knowledge tests encounter unexpected difficulties in more general, logic-oriented challenges.

One standout from the study is DeepSeek R1, a model prone to admitting defeat or offering uncertain responses rather than risking incorrect answers. This behavior underscores a need for improved inference-time techniques that guide models to wrap up reasoning before their capacity is maxed out.

This research also examines how extending reasoning time impacts accuracy, shedding light on the point of diminishing returns. As AI continues to evolve, this paper sets the stage for developing more robust, adaptable models that reflect human-like reasoning across a broader spectrum of tasks. For anyone interested in AI's next frontier, this paper is a compelling read.

1. **Reasoning vs. Recall Debate**  
   - Critics argue some puzzles (e.g., identifying brands or cities) rely on **memory/recall** rather than pure reasoning.  
   - Supporters counter that even "trivial" tasks require **non-trivial mental search** (e.g., filtering plausible candidates under constraints), which models struggle with.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to **ARC-AGI puzzles**, which blend perception and logic, and **Project Euler problems**, where brute-force computation often overshadows reasoning.

2. **Model Weaknesses Exposed**  
   - Examples highlight models failing basic logic, like comparing decimals (e.g., "Is 99 > 911?") due to **arithmetic confusion** or misidentifying digit places.  
   - DeepSeek R1’s tendency to **give up prematurely** or produce nonsensical answers (e.g., "Dry Eye" puzzle) underscores gaps in structured reasoning.  
   - Users note models often **overcomplicate steps** or get trapped in loops, even with chain-of-thought prompting.

3. **Training and Benchmark Critiques**  
   - Some suggest **improved prompting strategies** (e.g., step-by-step breakdowns) or **reward functions** that encourage diverse reasoning paths over brute-force token generation.  
   - Criticisms of the benchmark’s **US-centric examples** and unclear distinction between "PhD-level" vs. general knowledge (e.g., the term "PhD Knowledge" is dismissed as rebranded IQ testing).  
   - Comparisons to **GPQA** and **Humanity's Exam** highlight existing benchmarks requiring niche expertise, which this paper avoids.

4. **Broader Implications**  
   - Users question whether **RLHF** (human feedback) stifles models’ natural reasoning by prioritizing "safe" answers.  
   - The discussion underscores the need for benchmarks that **isolate reasoning** from memorization and cultural biases, while improving models’ ability to **self-correct** mid-process.

**Takeaway**: The paper sparks important conversations about defining and testing reasoning in AI, but challenges remain in designing tasks that truly separate logic from recall and cultural knowledge.

### Intel ruined an Israeli startup it bought for $2B–and lost the AI race

#### [Submission URL](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctechnews/article/s1tra0sfye) | 96 points | by [danielklnstn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=danielklnstn) | [68 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42992783)

In a fascinating deep dive, we explore the rise and fall of Habana Labs, an Israeli semiconductor startup that Intel acquired with high hopes back in 2019. This startup was poised to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space with its promising Gaudi chips, which even caught Amazon’s attention for powering their large language models in the cloud.

Fast forward a few years, and the tale has flipped: Nvidia is now valued at a staggering $3.5 trillion, while Intel’s valuation has plummeted to $80 billion. Intel recently reported disappointing financial results and ultimately decided not to further develop Gaudi processors beyond their third iteration. This effectively sealed the fate of Habana Labs as yet another unsuccessful acquisition in Intel’s history.

This is particularly surprising given the track record of Avigdor Willenz, the Israeli entrepreneur behind Habana Labs. Known for successful ventures like Galileo and Annapurna Labs, both of which were acquired by major tech players for billions, Willenz’s string of wins had seemed almost untouchable.

What went wrong? The answers point back to Intel's own challenges. Even as Intel tried to break into the AI space—correctly identifying its significance—it struggled with acquisitions. It attempted to integrate Habana as a separate entity before ultimately dismantling it last year. Much of Habana’s original talent left soon after their retention period, taking with them the innovative spark that first attracted industry giants.

Intel’s decision not to acquire Mellanox for a strategic position in AI, an opportunity Nvidia snatched up eagerly for $7 billion, only adds salt to the wound. It’s a classic story of missteps and missed opportunities in the fast-paced tech world, highlighting the unpredictable nature of competition and the precarious journey from innovation to market dominance.

The Hacker News discussion about Intel's acquisition of Habana Labs and its broader struggles in the AI chip market highlights several key themes:

### 1. **Intel’s Management and Acquisition Missteps**
   - Commenters criticize Intel’s history of mishandling acquisitions, arguing that Habana Labs’ failure reflects systemic issues like poor integration, lack of strategic focus, and internal culture clashes.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to other Intel acquisitions (e.g., Nervana, Altera) that failed to deliver, suggesting a pattern of buying innovative startups only to stifle their potential through bureaucracy.  
   - A notable example: Intel’s decision not to acquire Mellanox (later bought by Nvidia for $7B) is seen as a critical missed opportunity in AI infrastructure.  

### 2. **Technical Challenges and Ecosystem Weaknesses**
   - Nvidia’s dominance is attributed to its mature software stack (CUDA) and developer ecosystem, which Intel struggled to match. Habana’s hardware, while promising, lacked equivalent software support.  
   - Users note that AI accelerators require robust frameworks (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow), and Intel’s fragmented efforts (Gaudi, Ponte Vecchio GPUs) failed to coalesce into a unified platform.  

### 3. **Cultural and Retention Issues**
   - Habana’s talent reportedly left after retention periods expired, reflecting Intel’s inability to retain innovators. This mirrors past failures where acquired teams clashed with Intel’s corporate structure.  
   - Some argue Intel’s management prioritized short-term financial goals over long-term R&D, leading to a "brain drain" of engineers and visionaries.  

### 4. **Broader Industry Context**
   - Comparisons to historical tech failures (e.g., Nortel’s collapse, Cisco’s acquisition strategy) underscore the difficulty of sustaining innovation in large corporations.  
   - Successful acquisitions (e.g., Google/YouTube, Nvidia/Mellanox) are contrasted with Intel’s struggles, emphasizing the importance of preserving a startup’s autonomy and culture post-acquisition.  

### 5. **Nvidia’s Strategic Edge**
   - Commenters highlight Nvidia’s early bets on AI (dating back to 2012 with AlexNet) and its ability to pivot from gaming GPUs to AI infrastructure. Intel’s delayed response and lack of cohesive strategy left it playing catch-up.  

### Final Takeaway  
The discussion paints Intel as a company hampered by internal dysfunction, missed opportunities, and an inability to adapt to the software-centric demands of modern AI. Habana Labs’ demise is seen as symptomatic of deeper issues, with Nvidia’s success underscoring the importance of ecosystem-building and visionary leadership. As one user succinctly put it: *"Intel correctly identified the AI future but failed to execute meaningfully."*

### The LLMentalist Effect

#### [Submission URL](https://softwarecrisis.dev/letters/llmentalist/) | 114 points | by [zahlman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zahlman) | [110 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42983571)

In a thought-provoking piece, Baldur Bjarnason explores the phenomenon he dubs the "LLMentalist Effect," likening the perceived intelligence of chat-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to the age-old art of psychic con tricks. He argues that, despite public perception, LLMs lack the capacity for true reasoning or intelligence. Instead, like a psychic employing "cold reading" techniques, LLMs effectively use statistical guesses and validation statements to create an illusion of understanding and specificity.

Bjarnason suggests that this misconception is much like what happens in a psychic’s con: people see intelligence where none exists, fueled by a psychological trick akin to the Forer effect—a tendency to accept vague and general statements as highly accurate for oneself. He observes that some LLM enthusiasts exhibit a mix of awe and skepticism reminiscent of those charmed by psychic readings.

Critically, Bjarnason illuminates the process behind psychic cons, drawing fascinating parallels to AI interactions. He explains how psychics—and by extension, LLMs—craft convincing illusions by catering to eagerly self-selecting audiences, setting charismatic scenes, and offering statements that appear personalized yet are broadly applicable. Through such tactics, both tap into subjective validation to leave their audiences believing that something truly extraordinary has occurred.

Ultimately, Bjarnason stresses that while many use cases for LLMs appear valuable, they risk veering into the realm of pseudoscience and overhyped tech narratives if not scrutinized carefully. Concluding with a nod to skepticism, his insights invite us to question the nature of intelligence and how easily we can be enchanted by the seemingly miraculous capabilities of both psychics and machines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion**

The discussion explores the analogy between LLMs and psychic cold-reading techniques, debating whether these models exhibit true intelligence or merely a convincing illusion. Key themes emerge:

1. **Illusion vs. Reality of Intelligence**  
   - Participants compare LLMs to psychics, arguing both use statistical patterns and vague, validated statements to create a false sense of specificity. One user notes that LLMs, like psychics, rely on "self-selecting audiences" prone to anthropomorphizing outputs.  
   - The "Eliza effect" is highlighted, where humans project intelligence onto systems through charismatic interactions (e.g., a Santa Claus-themed program charming children).

2. **Mechanics of LLMs**  
   - LLMs are framed as *stochastic parrots* that mimic reasoning via statistical pattern-matching, not true understanding. For example, generating grammatically correct sentences doesn’t equate to comprehension.  
   - Critics argue that RLHF (Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback) may inadvertently train models to produce confident, appealing answers rather than truthful ones, mirroring psychics offering "comforting news" to clients.

3. **Defining Intelligence**  
   - Debate arises over *intelligence* as a concept: some define it narrowly (problem-solving ability), while others emphasize consciousness, awareness, or collective/biological intelligence. AI researchers are accused of prioritizing "usefulness" over philosophical rigor.  
   - A divide exists between those viewing intelligence as *information processing* (applied even to plants or cells) and those insisting on human-like reasoning and consciousness.

4. **Practical Utility vs. Hype**  
   - Some assert LLMs’ value lies in utility regardless of "thinking" capability. Others warn of overinvestment based on inflated expectations, likening it to the 2000s dot-com bubble.  
   - Skeptics highlight limitations: LLMs fail at puzzles requiring structured reasoning, and commercially viable uses often lack transformative impact, prioritizing cost savings over innovation.

5. **Criticism of Research Narratives**  
   - Critics accuse AI researchers of vague definitions and PR-driven narratives, dismissing interdisciplinary insights (e.g., cognitive science). One user laments that discussions about intelligence often devolve into abstract, unproductive debates.

**Conclusion**  
The thread reflects a mix of skepticism and cautious optimism. While LLMs’ practical applications are acknowledged, participants stress the need for clearer frameworks to distinguish statistical pattern-matching from genuine reasoning. The parallel to psychic trickery underscores broader concerns about anthropomorphism and commercialization in AI discourse.

### Value-Based Deep RL Scales Predictably

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04327) | 66 points | by [bearseascape](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bearseascape) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979846)

In an intriguing new paper on arXiv, researchers Oleh Rybkin, Michal Nauman, Preston Fu, Charlie Snell, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, and Aviral Kumar explore an essential aspect of machine learning—scaling predictability—in value-based deep reinforcement learning (RL). Traditionally, the machine learning community has viewed scaling RL as notoriously unpredictable. However, this team shows that it's more straightforward than previously thought when dealt with the right approach.

The research breaks down the scaling process into three key findings. Firstly, the team discovered that the relationship between data and compute demands for achieving specific performance levels forms a Pareto frontier. They identified a crucial metric called the updates-to-data (UTD) ratio that influences this frontier. Understanding this helps in predicting the data requirements given more compute, and vice versa.

Secondly, the researchers devised a strategy for optimal resource allocation. For any given performance target, they outlined how best to distribute resources across data and compute to maximize output. This leads to selecting hyperparameters that best utilize the given budget.

Thirdly, they addressed concerns unique to RL, such as overfitting and plasticity loss, by estimating predictable relationships between hyperparameters. This insight allowed them to manage and optimize these effects, assisting in achieving more consistent scaling behavior.

Their comprehensive examination of three RL algorithms (SAC, BRO, and PQL) across platforms like DeepMind Control, OpenAI gym, and IsaacGym underlines the validity of their approach. Their methodology offers a promising direction for scaling RL systems predictably, making large-scale experiments more manageable and less guesswork-intensive. This breakthrough stands to simplify previously challenging aspects of machine learning, paving the way for more robust and scalable AI applications.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**  
1. **Comparison to Prior Work**: A user references a YouTube video (unlinked) highlighting historical discussions on compute vs. data scaling, suggesting potential parallels or contrasts to the paper's findings. They also commend the paper for "rediscovering fundamental theorems," implying the work integrates key ideas for predictable scaling.  

2. **Scalability Questions**: A commenter questions how scalable value-based off-policy RL (like SAC) truly is in practice, contrasting it with policy-based methods. They raise concerns about whether the approach’s reliance on recorded data (rather than actively exploring environments) might limit scalability.  

3. **Hyperparameter Sensitivity & Optimism**: A third user acknowledges RL’s notorious finickiness with hyperparameters, making research stressful, but praises the paper for enabling concrete predictions about training settings. They express excitement that this work could simplify RL training, leading to more reliable "recipes" and expanding research accessibility.  

**Overall Tone**: The discussion reflects guarded optimism—applauding efforts to systematize RL scaling while flagging practical hurdles (scalability nuances, hyperparameter tuning). The paper is seen as a step toward demystifying RL experimentation.

### Bolt: Bootstrap long chain-of-thought in LLMs without distillation [pdf]

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03860) | 13 points | by [TaurenHunter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TaurenHunter) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42979901)

In an exciting advancement in the world of language models, a new study titled "BOLT: Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought in Language Models without Distillation" by Bo Pang and colleagues presents a groundbreaking approach to enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Unlike earlier methods that heavily relied on distillation from existing models—like OpenAI's o1—BOLT (Bootstrap Long Chain-of-Thought) introduces a novel strategy to achieve superior reasoning without costly reliance on models or intensive human input.

The BOLT method is remarkable not just for its innovative approach but also for its simplicity. It requires only a few in-context learning examples, as evidenced by their experiment with just 10 examples. The process involves three key stages: bootstrapping LongCoT data using in-context learning on a standard instruct model, LongCoT supervised finetuning, and continued online training for refinement. The team employed the Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct model, successfully scaling their strategy across various model sizes.

The study yielded impressive outcomes across multiple benchmarks, including Arena-Hard, MT-Bench, and MATH500, showcasing BOLT's ability to enhance reasoning in diverse tasks beyond the traditional focus areas such as math and coding. This research not only opens new avenues for the development of LLMs with advanced reasoning capabilities but also underscores the potential for simplified, scalable methods in deploying complex AI functionalities.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around clarifying the concept of model **distillation** and challenging claims that methods like BOLT (or other models such as DeepSeek) fully avoid distillation from existing LLMs (e.g., OpenAI). Key points:  

1. **Distillation Definition**:  
   - Distillation typically transfers knowledge from a larger "teacher" model to a smaller "student" model by training the student to mimic the teacher's token probability distributions or outputs.  
   - This requires aligned tokenization schemes and training data from the teacher.  

2. **Debates Over Terminology**:  
   - Some argue that fine-tuning smaller models on outputs from larger models (even with limited data) could still be considered distillation, albeit simplified.  
   - Critics (e.g., user **krtp**) distinguish true distillation (optimizing KL divergence between teacher/student distributions) from standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which lacks alignment with the teacher’s token-level distributions.  

3. **BOLT’s Claims vs. Reality**:  
   - Comments suggest DeepSeek and similar models likely used distillation (or analogous techniques), contradicting assertions of "no distillation."  
   - The BOLT paper’s reliance on in-context examples for bootstrapping might still align with lightweight distillation-like processes.  

4. **Scalability**:  
   - User **nckthgrk** notes distillation often requires millions of examples depending on model size, raising questions about whether BOLT’s 10-example approach fully captures general reasoning capabilities.  

**Key Takeaway**: The debate highlights ambiguity around defining "distillation," with skeptics arguing many methods (including BOLT) implicitly rely on knowledge transfer akin to distillation’s principles. Broader implications for LLM advancement depend on clearer definitions and ethical transparency.

### Do-nothing scripting: the key to gradual automation (2019)

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) | 162 points | by [tehnub](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tehnub) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976698)

In the digital age, manual, repetitive tasks, or "slogs" as they’re coined, can sap the productivity of operations teams. Though some teams might dream of full automation, they often stall due to the perceived all-or-nothing nature of such projects. Enter the notion of "do-nothing scripting," a clever strategy to ease these mundane processes into the realm of automation bit by bit.

The concept of do-nothing scripting involves creating a script that maps out a cumbersome manual task, like provisioning user accounts, as discrete, manageable steps. Each step is encapsulated in a function—a simple script that prompts the user to perform each part of the task manually. While it doesn’t automate the process immediately, it creates an organized pathway toward eventual automation, ensuring no steps are misplaced or forgotten.

The real charm lies in its progressiveness: each step becomes a candidate for future automation. Over time, this incremental approach can build a robust library of automation scripts, minimizing toil gradually rather than in one monumental leap. The method transforms frustrating slogs into structured procedural flows, lowering the threshold for automation initiatives and making it easier for teams to focus their energies on more rewarding challenges.

Ultimately, do-nothing scripting shines as a strategic bridge between manual burden and automated efficiency, helping teams nudge their operating procedures from a time-consuming slog to an efficient sprint.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion on "do-nothing scripting" highlights its value as a low-effort gateway to automation, though with nuanced critiques and extensions. Key points include:  

1. **Incremental Adoption**: Commenters praised the approach for reducing the cognitive load of tackling manual processes. Scripting discrete steps (e.g., Jira workflows, SSH key provisioning) creates a clear roadmap for future automation while providing immediate documentation.  

2. **Tool Comparisons**: Some favored command-line scripts for transparency and repeatability over GUI tools. Others suggested Jupyter notebooks or Ansible playbooks as alternatives for structured workflows.  

3. **Critiques**: Criticisms centered on potential overhead (e.g., unnecessary scripts for tasks already solvable via tools like `github-keygen`) and security risks (e.g., blindly generating SSH keys via AI-generated scripts without human oversight).  

4. **Broader Insights**:  
   - **Documentation**: Scripts act as living checklists, aiding onboarding and process accountability.  
   - **GUIs as Bottlenecks**: Several users lamented the brittleness of automating GUI-driven tasks versus CLI-native workflows.  
   - **AI Integration**: An example of using ChatGPT to generate "do-nothing" steps raised debates about balancing automation speed with security best practices.  

5. **Related Work**: Links to prior discussions (3+ years old) show lasting interest in minimal automation strategies, alongside tools like Fabric and POSSE-inspired scripts.  

Ultimately, the method is seen as a pragmatic bridge from manual to automated work, though success hinges on avoiding over-engineering and prioritizing critical steps.

In today's tech buzz, Hacker News is spotlighting Pantograph, a cutting-edge structure editor crafted by Jacob Prinz and Henry Blanchette. This intriguing tool, detailed in the POPL 2025 paper titled "Pantograph: A Fluid and Typed Structure Editor", is designed for more intuitive programming by operating directly on a typed syntax tree.

Traditional editors parse text before checking types, but Pantograph flips the script by allowing users to fill 'typed holes' within a syntax tree. This lets programmers manipulate complex expressions like lists with ease, simplifying edits that previously required arduous reconfigurations. A key feature is its 'tree selection' or 'zipper editing', which enhances typical structure editing by maintaining program grammars and, ideally, their types.

Pantograph also takes well-typed programming a step further by introducing a grammar of type diffs to handle how edits alter program types. It offers some automated fixes for type errors, yet wisely allows users to address certain issues later to preserve potentially useful code fragments.

This innovative system is poised to simplify functional programming and is now available for users to explore online. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, Pantograph offers an exciting new approach to writing and editing code efficiently. For those eager to dive deeper into its functionalities or contribute to its development, the project's code is open-source and available for exploration on GitHub.

### The Age of Agent Experience

#### [Submission URL](https://stytch.com/blog/the-age-of-agent-experience/) | 98 points | by [bobfunk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bobfunk) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974429)

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI agents like ChatGPT Operator and coding tools such as Devin are revolutionizing user interaction with apps by autonomously navigating interfaces, executing tasks, and making requests on users' behalf. This shift necessitates a new focus on designing the "Agent Experience" (AX), where autonomous agents become a primary audience requiring secure, transparent, and efficient handling of data and actions.

Julianna Lamb emphasizes the growing importance of AX alongside traditional User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). Just like UX reshaped how humans interface with technology and DX prioritized developer tools and APIs, AX addresses the needs of AI agents that increasingly perform tasks autonomously. This change is propelled by agents' enhanced capabilities due to advancements in large language models and multi-modal inputs, which imbue them with "agency" – the power to initiate actions and manage tasks independently.

To harness AI agents effectively, businesses must ensure robust systems for agent authentication and authorization, with OAuth being a powerful ally in this regard. OAuth allows secure, delegated access without sharing passwords, using access tokens, and defining specific scopes. This facilitates secure user consent and streamlined agent operations, which are paramount as agents take on more roles traditionally handled by users.

The shift towards AX requires investing in clean, well-defined APIs that provide agents with reliable access to the necessary functionalities. Easy onboarding, minimal friction, and efficient operations are key to maximizing both agent productivity and user satisfaction. In certain cases, such as high-stakes transactions, step-up authentication should be employed to ensure human oversight over crucial actions.

As agents increasingly handle product or platform interactions, companies offering open ecosystems with easy onboarding, open APIs, and secure authentication are set to excel, outpacing closed, vertically integrated systems. By ensuring a quality agent experience, businesses not only support AI-driven agents but enhance their overall offering for human users, driving wider adoption and satisfaction.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the challenges and opportunities in designing for AI agents (Agent Experience or AX) as they interact with systems on users' behalf. Key themes include:  

1. **Authentication & Security**:  
   - **OAuth** is highlighted as a critical tool for secure agent authentication, enabling delegated access without password sharing. Users emphasize its role in tracking agent actions and revoking access if agents misbehave.  
   - **Step-up authentication** (e.g., requiring human approval for sensitive transactions) and **hardware-based security** (physical tokens, USB keys) are proposed for high-stakes actions, though some criticize these as cumbersome.  

2. **CAPTCHA Challenges**:  
   - Traditional CAPTCHAs are seen as ineffective against AI agents, which can solve them cheaply. Alternatives like behavioral analysis (e.g., mouse movement patterns, network signals) or phone-based verification are debated.  

3. **APIs vs. Screen-Scraping**:  
   - Participants advocate for **robust APIs** over screen-scraping, which is brittle and error-prone. Examples like Plaid’s transition from screen-scraping to OAuth in fintech illustrate this shift.  
   - Some argue UIs designed for humans force agents to rely on unreliable methods, leading to calls for standardized, agent-friendly APIs.  

4. **Economic Incentives & Ecosystems**:  
   - Open platforms with **agent-friendly APIs** are predicted to outperform closed systems. Amazon’s dominance is cited as a cautionary example, where prioritizing sales over UX leads to competitive challenges.  
   - Concerns about brands losing control in open ecosystems are balanced against the inevitability of agents reshaping markets.  

5. **Technical Hurdles**:  
   - Developers note the difficulty of creating agents that navigate human-centric UIs, citing Firefox extensions using LLMs that break when websites change.  
   - Proposals include **HATEOAS** (hypermedia APIs) for agent navigation and behavioral heuristics (e.g., timing, deterministic signals) to distinguish agents from humans.  

6. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - Some users question whether OAuth truly meets agent needs yet, pointing to evolving standards. Others joke about agents "working in corporate factories" or replacing humans entirely.  

**Takeaway**: The shift to AX requires rethinking authentication, API design, and security, with OAuth and open ecosystems poised to play central roles. However, technical and economic challenges persist, particularly in balancing automation with human oversight and adapting legacy systems for agents. The discussion reflects both optimism for AI-driven efficiency and skepticism about implementation hurdles.
