### You probably don’t need to fine-tune an LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tidepool.so/2023/08/17/why-you-probably-dont-need-to-fine-tune-an-llm/) | 168 points | by [gk1](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gk1) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37174850)

Today's post is for all the builders out there focused on developing LLM (large language models) applications. As a builder, it's crucial to know what tools are available in your toolbox and when to use them. With the booming experimentation in the LLM field, there's a wide range of techniques and acronyms to navigate, like fine-tuning, RLHF, RAG, and chain-of-thought.

However, it's easy to get stuck in decision paralysis when determining the best technical approach for your app, even if your ultimate goal is simply to build an app for a specific purpose. Many people encounter issues when using base model LLMs, such as models not returning desired results, providing nonsensical answers, or lacking knowledge on certain topics they weren't trained on. This is when many consider fine-tuning as a solution.

In this post, we'll explore why fine-tuning might not be necessary for your app. People often turn to fine-tuning when they need additional structure or style from the LLM beyond open-ended question answering, or when they want the LLM to answer questions using knowledge that it wasn't trained on. However, a combination of two techniques, few-shot prompting and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), can often suffice for most use cases.

So, why do people think fine-tuning is helpful in the first place? Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained LLM and training it further on a smaller, domain-specific dataset to make it more specialized for a specific task or data. However, it's worth noting that as of August 2023, OpenAI only supports fine-tuning for its GPT-3 models, not the newer GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models that power ChatGPT.

While the base LLMs have a range of abilities like question answering and summarization, some may find them too generic or unaware of their particular use case. The desire to fine-tune often stems from the belief that more training will improve accuracy in the target task. However, there are several reasons why the existing base LLM and the aforementioned techniques may be sufficient:

1. It's cheaper and leverages the existing training of the base LLM.
2. Techniques like RAG allow access to private knowledge bases by storing embeddings in vector databases and querying them semantically.
3. Desired style or format can be achieved using a more specific prompt and improved with few-shot prompting by providing examples within the context window.
4. Providing additional context in each prompt is not a token usage concern, as token usage isn't expensive.
5. Fine-tuning doesn't guarantee accurate answers and doesn't prevent LLM from hallucinating, whereas using clear questions with a source provided to the base model may result in more reliable answers.

In conclusion, the combination of few-shot prompting and retrieval-augmented generation techniques can often meet the needs of LLM applications without resorting to the complexity and cost of fine-tuning.

The discussion on the submission primarily revolves around the effectiveness and necessity of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). 

One commenter suggests that using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and few-shot prompting can often be sufficient for most use cases, eliminating the need for fine-tuning. They highlight the benefits of these techniques, such as leveraging existing training, accessing private knowledge bases, and achieving desired style or format. Additionally, they point out that fine-tuning doesn't guarantee accurate answers and can result in the model hallucinating.

Another commenter shares their positive experience using a large context window and examples for challenging tasks. They note that breaking down complex questions into multiple steps within the context window can be effective.

Some commenters discuss the limitations and challenges of fine-tuning, including the need for a large amount of high-quality training data and the effort involved. They argue that for most developers relying on pre-trained models, using context-specific prompts is sufficient.

The discussion also touches on other topics related to LLMs, such as the potential dangers of hallucination, the benefits of retrieval-augmented generation, the challenges of working with large models, and the significance of model size and training data in the effectiveness of LLMs.

### RoboAgent: A universal agent with 12 Skills

#### [Submission URL](https://robopen.github.io/) | 132 points | by [reqo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reqo) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37167698)

Introducing RoboAgent: A Universal Robotic Agent with 12 Skills

The quest for a single robot that can manipulate any object in diverse settings has been a distant goal for decades. However, the lack of diverse robotics datasets and generic agents capable of generating such datasets has hindered progress. Enter RoboAgent, a universal robotic agent developed by a team at Carnegie Mellon University and Meta AI.

RoboAgent is a culmination of two years of work and aims to efficiently acquire multiple skills within a practical data budget and generalize them to unseen situations. The team built RoboPen, a distributed robotics infrastructure, and RoboHive, a framework for robot learning across simulation and real-world operations. They also created RoboSet, a high-quality dataset representing multiple skills with everyday objects in diverse scenarios.

To tackle the challenge of low-data regimes and overfitting, the team employed an efficient language conditioned multi-task offline imitation learning framework called MT-ACT. They used semantic augmentations to inject world priors from existing foundation models into the RoboSet dataset, creating a heavily multi-modal dataset with a rich diversity of skills, tasks, and scenarios. They then developed MT-ACT, a novel efficient policy representation that can handle this multi-modal dataset while avoiding overfitting.

RoboAgent was trained on just 7,500 trajectories, a fraction of the data used by previous methods, yet it exhibited 12 non-trivial manipulation skills across 38 tasks and could generalize to hundreds of diverse unseen scenarios. It even showed the ability to evolve its capabilities with new experiences.

The team also released the RoboSet dataset, consisting of 100,050 trajectories, and open-sourced their entire dataset to accelerate research in robot-learning. With RoboAgent's sample efficiency and ability to generalize, the dream of a universal robotic agent may be within reach.

The discussion on this submission begins with users commenting on the 12 skills that RoboAgent has learned. One user points out that there are skills beyond the 12 mentioned in the article. Another user jokingly adds "computer hacking skills" to the list. 

There are later comments discussing the related research paper "RT-2" and its comparison to "RT-1." 

One user criticizes the presentation format of the article, finding it somewhat contradictory and lacking in clarity.

A couple of comments question the purpose of RoboAgent and its skills. One user sarcastically states that it is a "battery god" while another user expresses their wish for 12 skills.

The discussion then shifts to comparing RoboAgent's achievements to those of Boston Dynamics. Some users express enthusiasm for the advancements in robotics, while others bring up the use of classical versus deep learning techniques and the need for AI to intersect with robotics.

There is a discussion about the comments section in general, with some users stating that negative comments are discouraging and hinder progress. A user adds that Boston Dynamics largely uses classical learning techniques and that AI research needs to focus on creating practical and usable results.

Other comments mention finding Boston Dynamics' GitHub resources and note that Boston Dynamics' robots perform tasks in a pre-programmed manner.

The discussion ends with one user praising Boston Dynamics' robots and their impressive abilities.

### I am afraid to inform you that you have built a compiler (2022)

#### [Submission URL](https://rachit.pl/post/you-have-built-a-compiler/) | 251 points | by [mutant_glofish](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mutant_glofish) | [88 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37162898)

In a hilariously tongue-in-cheek post, the author addresses those who set out to avoid building a compiler but ended up inadvertently creating one. The letter highlights the irony of starting with a simple prototype and ending up with a complex mess of string mangling scripts. The author playfully mocks the idea of stubbornly avoiding a proper compiler infrastructure, only to later realize the benefits of using an abstract syntax tree (AST) library. Yet, even with the AST, the challenges continue, as users push the boundaries of the language with nested constructs, leading to constant patches and distractions from essential features. The post amusingly describes the temptation to simplify the AST by assuming certain program shapes but warns of the risks of losing crucial information and the burden it places on future developers. Finally, the author hilariously recounts the demand for backward compatibility with an older version, forcing further code simplification and implementation tweaks. The punchline: despite all endeavors to avoid building a compiler, the end result is unmistakably a compiler, complete with a parser, intermediate representation, transformation passes, and a code generator. So, to all those who never wanted to build a compiler, the author informs them: "Dear Sir, you have built a compiler."

The discussion on this submission covers various perspectives on the topic of building a compiler. Some users share their experiences and opinions on the challenges and benefits of building a compiler. There is also a discussion about billing clients for development work, with differing views on whether hourly billing is fair or if a different approach should be taken. Additionally, there are comments discussing the use of domain-specific languages (DSLs) and the potential advantages and disadvantages they offer. Some users also discuss their experiences with building and using compilers in different programming languages. Overall, the discussion provides a range of insights and perspectives on the topic of building compilers.

### Future Intel CPUs May Dump Hyper-Threading for Partitioned Thread Scheduling

#### [Submission URL](https://hothardware.com/news/future-intel-cpu-partition-threads) | 50 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163191)

Intel is considering ditching Hyper-Threading in future CPUs in favor of a new technique called partitioned thread scheduling, according to a recently published patent. Hyper-Threading, which is Intel's version of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), aims to improve occupancy and utilization of a processor core's functional units. However, it is not always efficient, as a single program thread rarely fills all of a processor's functional units. The new partitioned thread scheduling technique analyzes the work required by a thread and breaks application threads into segments using partitions. These partitioned threads are then scheduled onto processor cores based on their performance requirements. This technique aims to optimize core utilization and improve overall efficiency.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implications of Intel potentially ditching Hyper-Threading in favor of partitioned thread scheduling. Some users express their skepticism about the performance benefits of Hyper-Threading, citing benchmark tests that showed minimal speed improvements. Others discuss the potential drawbacks of partitioned thread scheduling, such as increased cache misses and the need for software compatibility. 

One user mentions that Intel's Thread Director technology in Alder Lake CPUs may address some of the performance and power consumption issues associated with Hyper-Threading. Another user raises the point that the patent application does not necessarily indicate an imminent replacement of Hyper-Threading but rather suggests a possible alternative scheduling technique.

There is also a discussion about the difference between physical cores and logical cores and how Hyper-Threading fits into this context. Some users argue that physical cores are more important for performance and that SMT can lead to limiting factors and behavior that affect overall efficiency.

Overall, the discussion highlights various perspectives and considerations regarding the potential shift from Hyper-Threading to partitioned thread scheduling in future Intel CPUs.

### Report: Potential NYT lawsuit could force OpenAI to wipe ChatGPT and start over

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/08/report-potential-nyt-lawsuit-could-force-openai-to-wipe-chatgpt-and-start-over/) | 24 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37165646)

The New York Times may be considering a lawsuit against OpenAI over alleged infringement of its intellectual property rights. The Times recently updated its terms of service to prohibit AI companies from scraping its articles and images to train AI models. If the Times were to sue OpenAI, it could result in fines of up to $150,000 per infringing piece of content and the destruction of ChatGPT's dataset. This potential lawsuit could become the most high-profile legal battle over copyright protection in the AI industry. OpenAI is already facing legal challenges from popular authors over similar concerns. The Times' main concern is that ChatGPT could use its content to become a competitor by creating text that answers questions based on the original reporting and writing of the paper's staff. The Times had been considering a licensing deal with OpenAI, but meetings between the two parties have reportedly become contentious, making the deal increasingly unlikely.

#### [Submission URL](https://bellard.org/ts_server/ts_zip.html) | 240 points | by [Deeg9rie9usi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Deeg9rie9usi) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37152978)

The ts_zip utility in the ts_server software has introduced a new way to compress text files using Large Language Models. Unlike other compression tools, ts_zip achieves significantly higher compression ratios. However, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. Firstly, the language model needs to be available during decompression. Additionally, a GPU is necessary to achieve reasonable speeds, and it's crucial to use the same GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression. 

The compression ratio for each model is measured in bits per byte. CMIX v19 is particularly impressive in terms of compression. The table provided shows the compression ratios for various files, including alice29.txt, book1, enwik8, and linux-1.2.13.tar.

When compressing the book1 file on an RTX A6000 GPU, the compression speed and required GPU memory are measured. Interestingly, the decompression speed and memory requirements are similar. Different models, such as rwkv_169M, rwkv_430M, pythia_deduped_70M, rwkv_7B_q4, and falcon_7B_q4, are compared in terms of compression speed and GPU memory usage.

In conclusion, the smaller RWKV models seem to strike a good balance for text compression. They utilize less memory due to their RNN structure and offer relatively high compression speeds. Fabrice Bellard, the developer behind ts_zip, is the mastermind behind this innovative text compression utility.

The discussion surrounding the ts_zip utility focuses on various aspects of text compression using Large Language Models (LLMs). Some comments discuss the potential limitations and challenges of using LLMs for compression. One user points out that the models require the availability of the language model during decompression, and another highlights the need for a compatible GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression.

### Bayesian Flow Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037) | 81 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37134315)

A new paper titled "Bayesian Flow Networks" introduces a new class of generative models called Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs). BFNs modify the parameters of independent distributions using Bayesian inference based on noisy data samples. These modified parameters are then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. This generative procedure is similar to the reverse process of diffusion models but simpler since no forward process is required. The paper derives discrete and continuous-time loss functions for different types of data and proposes sample generation procedures. BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling and outperform existing discrete diffusion models on a character-level language modeling task. The network inputs for discrete data are on the probability simplex, making it possible to use gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains like language modeling. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

### What coal and Jevons’ paradox tell us about AI and data

#### [Submission URL](https://hex.tech/blog/jevons-paradox-demand-for-insight/) | 70 points | by [erehweb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erehweb) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129853)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the future of data jobs. Will computers replace human data practitioners? According to a blog post by Barry McCardel, the job of a data practitioner is more than just writing code or making charts. It involves formulating the right questions, anticipating the needs of stakeholders, and providing valuable insights. While AI can automate certain rote tasks, it is unlikely to replace the human element of data work.

McCardel draws a parallel to Jevons' Paradox, which observed that as coal-powered engines became more efficient, overall coal consumption increased. The same rebound effect could apply to AI and data. As the cost of generating insights decreases, the demand for data work and the number of questions that can be answered with data will likely increase. Organizations are supply-constrained when it comes to utilizing data, and AI can help unlock the untapped potential of data teams.

While AI will undoubtedly change how data practitioners work, McCardel argues that it will likely lead to an increased need for human hours rather than a decrease. The impact of data on organizations is far from reaching its theoretical limit, and AI can help data teams be more impactful. McCardel concludes by discussing Hex, a platform that enables the creation and sharing of interactive data products, and invites readers to explore opportunities with the company.

Overall, the blog post highlights the potential of AI to augment rather than replace human data practitioners, and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's main points about AI and the future of data jobs. One commenter agrees with the post, saying that AI may take over low-value tasks but will not replace the higher-level strategic work that humans can do. They argue that as technology progresses, there is a shift in the types of jobs available. Another commenter brings up the concern that AI may replace non-essential service vendors and result in organizational changes. 

There is also a discussion about the impact of automation on different types of jobs. Some argue that AI will lead to an increase in the need for human hours rather than a decrease. Others point out that certain jobs, like manual labor, may be more easily replaced by automation, while others believe that higher-skilled jobs will still be in demand. The potential impact on the middle class is also mentioned.

Another comment highlights the importance of natural language communication, social and emotional intelligence, and decision-making in certain professions, suggesting that AI may not fully replace these roles. However, another commenter challenges this notion, stating that AI has the potential to approximate decision-makers and replace jobs traditionally done by lower-skilled workers. They argue that humans are not horses and will adapt to new roles.

There is also a discussion about the current and future job market and the creation of new roles. Some argue that the current job market is not representative of the future, and there is uncertainty about the impact of AI on employment. Others discuss the changing dynamics in households and the increase in multiple jobs held by individuals.

The company formerly known as Twitter, now called X, has been slowing down the speed at which users can access links to news organizations and online competitors like the New York Times and Facebook. This move appears to be targeted at companies that have drawn the ire of owner Elon Musk. Users who clicked a link on Musk's website were made to wait about five seconds before seeing the page. However, X began reversing the throttling on some sites hours after the story was first published. The delay affected the t.co domain, a link-shortening service that X uses to process every link posted to the website. Traffic is routed through the domain, allowing X to track and potentially throttle activity to targeted websites, potentially affecting traffic and ad revenue. Some of the targeted businesses have expressed concerns about the delays and the potential for targeted pressure on news organizations. Online companies invest heavily to ensure their websites open quickly, as even tiny delays can lead to users abandoning the site.

Some users discuss how the throttling of traffic to specific websites was observed and comment on the technical aspects of how this could be implemented. There are also debates about the ethics of such actions and whether X should be allowed to engage in practices that potentially stifle competition. Some users argue that as a private company, X has the right to regulate its platform as it sees fit, while others express concerns about the implications for free speech and fair competition. Additionally, there are discussions about Elon Musk's motivations and behavior, as well as comparisons to other platforms like Facebook and Twitter in terms of content moderation and censorship.
