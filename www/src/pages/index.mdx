### FlashAttention: Fast Transformer training with long sequences

#### [Submission URL](https://www.adept.ai/blog/flashier-attention) | 146 points | by [kristianp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kristianp) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37724861)

Transformers have become increasingly powerful, but training them on long sequences has remained a challenge. The attention layer, which is at the core of Transformers, poses a bottleneck in terms of compute and memory. Doubling the sequence length would quadruple the runtime and memory requirements.

However, there is now a solution: FlashAttention, a new algorithm that speeds up attention and reduces its memory footprint without any approximation. Since its release six months ago, FlashAttention has been widely adopted by organizations and research labs to accelerate their training and inference processes.

Tri Dao, a researcher and part-time research fellow at Adept, has been collaborating with the company to improve FlashAttention. They have developed a key improvement that enables FlashAttention to be fast for long sequences, which opens up the possibility of training large language models with longer context.

For example, FlashAttention is now up to 2.7 times faster than a standard PyTorch implementation and up to 2.2 times faster than the optimized implementation from Megatron-LM, even at small batch sizes, when used on sequences with a length of 8k. This increased speed allows for training with longer context, resulting in higher-quality models.

The motivation for tackling long sequences is to scale up the context length of Transformers. Currently, the multihead attention layer in Transformers has a runtime and memory requirement that grows quadratically with the input sequence length. By training models that can understand books, high-resolution images, webpages, multi-turn user interactions, and long-form videos, the hope is to advance AI capabilities.

FlashAttention achieves its speed and efficiency improvements by reordering the attention computation and leveraging classical techniques like tiling and recomputation. These techniques significantly speed up attention and reduce memory usage from quadratic to linear in sequence length. However, FlashAttention was not initially optimized for the case of super long sequences, where batch sizes and numbers of heads are small, due to insufficient parallelism.

To optimize for long sequences with small batch sizes and small numbers of heads, FlashAttention now introduces attention parallelism. Each attention head uses classical tiling techniques to load blocks of query, key, and value from GPU memory to a faster cache, compute attention with respect to that block, and write back the output. This reduction in memory reads and writes brings significant speedup in most cases.

In the case of long sequences with small batch sizes or small numbers of heads, FlashAttention parallelizes over the sequence length dimension in order to make better use of the multiprocessors on the GPU. This results in a significant speedup for this regime.

Overall, FlashAttention offers a solution for training Transformers on long sequences, enabling the training of models with longer context. With its improved speed and memory efficiency, FlashAttention is making strides in advancing AI capabilities and pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with Transformers.

### Fake News Detectors Are Biased Against Texts Generated by Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08674) | 16 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37712713)

A new study has found that fake news detectors are biased against texts generated by large language models (LLMs). The spread of fake news has become a significant challenge, and LLMs have only intensified this issue by being able to generate highly believable fake content. The study revealed that existing detectors are more likely to flag LLM-generated content as fake news while misclassifying human-written fake news as genuine. This unexpected bias is due to distinct linguistic patterns in LLM outputs. To address this bias, the researchers introduced a mitigation strategy using adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news. This approach significantly improved the detection accuracy for both human and LLM-generated news. To encourage further research in this area, the researchers released two comprehensive datasets that combine human-validated articles with LLM-generated fake and real news.

The discussion begins with a user named Hendrikto expressing their interest in large language models (LLMs) and how they can generate both truthful statements and plausible fake news. They find it interesting that LLMs tend to flag LLM-generated content as fake news but misclassify human-written fake news as genuine. They mention that the researchers addressed this bias by using adversarial training with LLM-paraphrased genuine news, resulting in improved detection accuracy for both human and LLM-generated news. Another user, flr, suggests that this sounds like a "rabbit myth" and compares it to classifiers that mistake cloudy days for sunny ones.

User ttctcyf raises a point about the specificity of fake news sources and mentions a paper that lists different news sites categorized as either reliable or unreliable. They provide some examples of unreliable news websites labeled as conspiracy, pseudo-science, and misinformation. They also note that reliable news websites consist of mainstream and center-right sources. Another user, hlt, comments that LLMs are supposed to determine the truthfulness of things.

Then, user fllngknf states that humans can detect fake news and suggests that training LLMs to detect fake news is pointless. In response, user marginalia_nu points out the contradiction in the statement, mentioning that while humans cannot fly, machines can. Another user, ben_w, highlights the difficulty of determining truthfulness and mentions the concept of Munchausen Trilemma, where establishing perfect certainty about truth is impossible. They explain that all tests mimic system 2 thinking, which is slower than the decision-making done by humans. User marginalia_nu adds that generating labeled data holds challenges, as it may have undesired properties and can lead to different types of generated fake news. Another user, smbz, mentions the importance of human verification.

Finally, Grimblewald argues that humans have good detection of fake news through critical analysis and suggests that relying on technology alone is not sufficient for spotting fake news.

Farmers have been benefiting from the rise of AI in the agriculture industry, with new farm tools revolutionizing traditional farming practices. One such innovation is the Ecorobotix, a solar battery-powered robot that navigates crop fields with GPS assistance and efficiently destroys weeds. Another example is the LettuceBot, which uses advanced scanning technology to differentiate between weeds and crops, allowing for optimal growth and reduced pesticide usage. 

Researchers from the Universities of Edinburgh and Sheffield in the UK have taken inspiration from ants to tackle the challenge of visual navigation through dense vegetation. Ants are known for their efficient organization and complex problem-solving skills, which researchers believe can be translated to robotic structures. In a recent study published in the journal Science Robotics, the researchers developed an artificial neural network that mimics the route memory abilities of ants. By collecting images along unfamiliar routes and using the neural network algorithm, the researchers achieved positive results in navigating challenging, vegetation-dense fields. 

This research holds promise for advancements in agricultural robotics, as it provides a low-power and efficient solution for navigation in complex environments. By integrating insect-inspired navigation systems into robotic tools, future applications in agriculture, forestry, and environmental monitoring could greatly benefit from this technology.

The discussion on this submission revolves around a few different topics.

One commenter, "bcx," mentions a science fiction book called "Children Time" by Adrian Tchaikovsky that explores the concept of interconnected robots that clean.

Another commenter, "lmtbt," discusses the LettuceBot and its ability to scan crop geometry and distinguish between weeds and crops, which can help with optimal growth and reduced pesticide usage. They also mention the potential for these types of tools to replace pesticides and the low energy consumption and cost associated with them.

Another commenter, "myshp," suggests that tools that replace pesticides have the potential to be more impactful in terms of biodiversity preservation. They mention the possibilities of robots selectively pruning or changing fertilizer usage, and using machine learning systems to optimize multi-crop growing patterns and minimize risk while helping maintain local ecosystems.

A commenter named "dnfx" makes a brief comment about machine learning and AI technologies being used in internal document retrieval systems.

The last comment is a humorous one, simply saying "Holy cmm splc Batman."

The UK government has quietly dismissed the independent advisory board of its Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI), which was tasked with promoting the responsible deployment of data and AI technologies, especially within the public sector. The board's webpage was officially shut down on September 9, but a rather uninformative public announcement was released only yesterday. This move has raised concerns among tech business founders in the UK, who worry about transparency and trust in the government and call for a new era of accountability. The government's approach to AI governance has strongly focused on mitigating existential risks, while the CDEI's work has been focusing on the actual, day-to-day uses of data and AI.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the dismissal of the independent advisory board of the UK's Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) revolves around several key points:

1. Some users highlight that the CDEI's independent advisory board was dissolved, and its webpage was shut down. They express concerns about transparency and trust in the government and call for more accountability.

2. Others argue that the advisory board was never truly independent, as it was a specific government body within a specific government department. They say that it was not 100% clear and independent, but rather subject to political influence.

3. Some users point out that the UK government's approach to AI governance has largely focused on mitigating existential risks, while the CDEI's work focused on the day-to-day uses of data and AI. They suggest that the government's priorities may have played a role in the dismissal of the advisory board.

4. There is a discussion about the potential implications of this move, with some users speculating that it may reflect a shift towards a surveillance state or a lack of attention to ethical considerations in government programs.

5. Several users express disappointment about the lack of communication and transparency surrounding the dismissal of the advisory board. They note that the government's webpage for the board is closed, and there is limited information available.

6. One user mentions that the advisory board did not have access to future risk reports, implying a lack of necessary information for informed decision-making.

Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the transparency, independence, and ethical considerations in the UK government's approach to data and AI governance.

### Show HN: SapientML – Generative AutoML for Tabular Data

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/sapientml/sapientml) | 82 points | by [ya9do](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ya9do) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37698506)

SapientML is an AutoML technology that can generate high-quality pipelines for predictive tasks using tabular data. It learns from existing datasets and their human-written pipelines to efficiently generate pipelines for new datasets. With SapientML, you can run AutoML, obtain and run generated code, and access a model consisting of the generated code. The technology behind SapientML is based on a research paper published at the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). You can find more details and examples in the GitHub repository.

The discussion on the submission is as follows:

1. User "nwfcg" comments that they compared SapientML with other AutoML tools such as AutoGluon, FLAML, and H2O. They suggest that an independent benchmarking paper should be published to establish SapientML's superiority.
2. User "blprnv" disagrees with the assumption that SapientML is an example of AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). They express skepticism and suggest that the comment might be jumping to conclusions without relevant evidence. They apologize for the word choice in their comment.
3. User "Philpax" responds with a brief comment, stating that they wouldn't speculate on the matter.
4. User "tmhgns" explains that the reason for the generation of tabular AutoML solutions is simply due to the fact that it is a traditional approach. They mention that these systems learn from existing solutions and generate pipelines accordingly, citing a relevant research paper.
5. User "dcryn" suggests that there are already commercial offerings that outperform open-source tabular AutoML approaches, such as Datarobot, Azure AutoML, Vertex Bigquery AutoML, Alteryx, Dataiku, and SAS. They believe that if someone is starting with AutoML, commercial space has better options than open source.
6. User "nwfcg" responds that benchmarks and practical validations are needed to support claims about the superiority of commercial offerings. They mention that they haven't seen any commercial offerings outperform AutoGluon Tabular to date.
7. User "hrfrcmmnts" shares that there is a global ML Hackathon in November and they can't wait to try it.
8. User "lttrgrm" references a similar generative space caught back in 2017 and provides a link to an article. They express their astonishment at what might be happening internally within companies like Google.

### Food Delivery Robots Are Feeding Camera Footage to the LAPD

In a surprising turn of events, it has been revealed that a food delivery robot company in Los Angeles, which delivers for Uber Eats, provided video footage filmed by one of its robots to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) as evidence in a criminal case. The incident has sparked discussions about the constant surveillance that these delivery robots engage in and the potential privacy concerns associated with their use. The company, Serve Robotics, expressed an interest in working more closely with the LAPD, and the police department readily seized the opportunity. The specific incident involved an attempted theft of a Serve Robotics robot, which resulted in the arrest and conviction of the suspects. This case has shed light on the fact that delivery robots are always filming, raising questions about the extent of their surveillance capabilities and the potential implications for privacy. The deployment of such robots in urban areas has already become a contentious issue, with social media accounts documenting their presence and the challenges they pose to pedestrians and pets. While the LAPD claims that this incident is an isolated one, the use of video footage from delivery robots in criminal investigations has sparked a debate about the balance between public safety and individual privacy.

The discussion on this submission contains two comments. 

The first comment, made by user Legend2440, criticizes the headline of the article for not mentioning that the incident involving the food delivery robot company and the LAPD was a theft.
