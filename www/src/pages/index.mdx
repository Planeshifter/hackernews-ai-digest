### Finding near-duplicates with Jaccard similarity and MinHash

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/) | 226 points | by [brianyu8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianyu8) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872438)

In a recent blog post, the author delves into the topic of approximate deduplication using Jaccard similarity and the MinHash approximation technique. The post explores the concept of defining similarity between documents and the challenges of approximate deduplication at scale.

The Jaccard index, a measure widely used in text processing, compares sets by calculating the ratio of their overlap to the size of their union. The author explains how this index intuitively captures the similarity between sets based on their elements.

To scale up the process of finding approximate duplicates, the post discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing techniques for Jaccard similarity. By creating MinHash signatures for documents, which are small, fixed-size representations of the original sets, similar documents can be grouped efficiently.

By employing random sampling techniques and permutations, MinHash signatures offer a way to estimate Jaccard similarity between documents without examining the entire sets. This approach provides a practical method for identifying approximate duplicates within a large collection of documents.

The paper "Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion" introduces a novel training paradigm that combines the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models and next-token prediction models. By training a diffusion model to denoise tokens with varying noise levels, this approach, called Diffusion Forcing, allows for flexible and compositional generation while offering sequence-level guidance.

Diffusion Forcing can stabilize auto-regressive rollout, guide over long horizons, and support planning with causal uncertainty by utilizing different noise levels across a sequence during sampling. The method showcases stable and consistent video prediction results in datasets like DMLab and Minecraft, outperforming traditional teacher forcing and causal full-sequence diffusion models.

Moreover, Diffusion Forcing enables the generation of long videos beyond the training horizon without the need for a sliding window approach, demonstrating its stabilization effect. It also extends to diffusion planning, offering a decision-making framework with causal relationships and the ability to model long-horizon tasks like real robot arm manipulations.

Overall, Diffusion Forcing presents a versatile approach that optimizes a variational lower bound on token likelihoods, leading to marked performance gains in decision-making, planning tasks, and video prediction applications.
