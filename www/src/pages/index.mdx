The history of AI is a rollercoaster ride of hype and disillusionment, a cycle that seems to repeat itself with each new innovation. Scientists develop a novel mechanism, labeled as N, which requires significant computing resources and holds great promise. Funding pours in, leading to immediate results and revolutionary possibilities for machine cognition. The term "Artificial Intelligence" gets thrown around liberally, encompassing a wide range of technologies.

However, as time passes, overblown claims give way to skepticism, and the limitations of N become apparent. Competent practitioners quietly distance themselves from the AI label, and users start using more specific terms. Eventually, as computing power advances and products are released to underwhelming reception, investors lose interest, leading to a pivot away from AI towards other fields.

This pattern has repeated with previous technologies like neural networks in the 1950s and deep learning in the 2010s. Each cycle produces valuable technology but ultimately follows a predictable curve of rapid progress, followed by gradual improvement, and then a plateau. The AI hype cycle continues, with each new innovation becoming the next big thing before fading into the background as a more precise mechanism emerges.

2. **mrtndbp** expresses confusion about the current state of AI progress, comparing it to expert systems. They emphasize the importance of logical reasoning and principles in AI development, suggesting that AI advancements may not be as significant as hyped.

3. **dmvdg** engages in a debate about the mismatch between expert systems and hype in AI. They discuss the hype cycle in the AI field and point out the overstatements made by evangelists and marketers over the years. They emphasize the decline of hype over time.

4. **mrtndbp** argues against the validation of hype in technology, implying that hype does not dictate the actual technological advancements. They counter arguments about AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) claiming it might be overestimated similar to historical events like the invention of the nuclear bomb. They speculate about missing components for AGI similar to scaling laws in nuclear reactions.

5. **cntvnblzc** humorously mentions a link to the Theranos scandal in response to the discussions about overhyped technology.

6. **DerCommodore** flags the submission, possibly indicating some issue or violation.

Overall, the comments touch on skepticism towards the current state of AI progress, debate on the impact of hype, and humorous references to past technological scandals like Theranos.

### 26× Faster Inference with Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10637) | 123 points | by [georgehill](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=georgehill) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40416657)

Today's top story on Hacker News is a groundbreaking paper titled "Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models" by Haoyi Wu and Kewei Tu. This paper addresses the challenge of high memory consumption in deploying large language models for real-world applications. The proposed method focuses on optimizing the key-value (KV) cache for the attention mechanism in transformer architectures, significantly reducing memory usage and improving inference throughput. The experiments conducted demonstrate up to 26 times higher throughput compared to standard transformers, with competitive performance in language modeling and downstream tasks. The method is compatible with existing memory-saving techniques, offering further enhancements in inference efficiency. The paper has been accepted to the ACL2024 main conference, and the code is available for exploration.

1. **vssns**: The initial result of the Layer-Condensed KV Cache implementation in multiple decoder layers of Large Language Models shows lower model throughput suffered. The updated plan is to consolidate half of the KV layers, nearly maintaining memory savings. However, the downside is that the triple training worsens beyond long-context performance. The technique still has potential if deployed correctly, as computational performance matters little compared to extra room performance. Interesting experiments mentioned using prompt tokens and perplexity numbers.

2. **WhitneyLand**: Points out that the title appears incorrect and should match the paper's correct title "Layer-Condensed KV Cache for Efficient Inference of Large Language Models." The paper's claim of a 26x improvement is considered an outlier in the introduction, where the benchmark is mostly based on GPU-based workloads, with significant improvements ranging from 14x to 47x.

3. **jqncbzs**: Discusses OpenAI GPT-4o's inference optimization key, presenting it as being twice as fast and 50% cheaper. This approach could lead to direct cost savings and provides refreshing techniques published in papers from Stanford and Berkeley.

4. **trpplyns**: Talks about the combined Grouped Query Attention and Multi-Query Attention, which significantly reduces the size of the KV Cache, enhancing quality significantly. It's challenging to balance transformer speed and willingness to sacrifice quality, as there are trade-offs worth considering.

5. **vlovich123**: Mentions how the KV cache runs on the GPU and CPU traditionally, where the CPU enables running the GPU. The KV cache transiently stores tokens, unlike model weights, which are fixed. Furthermore, it constructs a token series representing knowledge learned sequentially during inference time, backed by a pretrained model.

6. **mtrngd**: Details how the method takes a token for a particular position and generates a token based on the preceding context tokens. This method allows for the quadrant-wise attention necessary to avoid degrading accuracy, especially when dealing with massive contexts. This approach enables batching in parallel to accommodate longer contexts efficiently.

Overall, the discussion encompasses various viewpoints on the paper's title correctness, the significance of the claimed performance improvements, practical applications of the proposed technique, and the implications of optimizing inference for large language models.
