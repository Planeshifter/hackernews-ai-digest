Recently, the topic of pangrams came up among friends, sparking a quest to create self-enumerating pangrams using ChatGPT. Pangrams are phrases that contain every letter of the alphabet at least once, such as the famous example, "the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."  ChatGPT-4o attempted to generate Spanish pangrams but struggled with missing letters like B, J, Ñ, P, Q, S, T, and X in its examples. Despite this, it managed to provide a correct well-known pangram upon correction, showcasing its language understanding capabilities. 

When tasked with creating a novel pangram, ChatGPT presented a quirky phrase, "El pingüino ñato y jovial, experto en boxeo, lanzó su eficaz jaque mate a la rápida bruja del volcán." However, this phrase was missing the letters H, K, and W. After being informed of the error, ChatGPT swiftly identified the missing letters and aimed to create a complete pangram. Overall, the experiment with pangrams and ChatGPT highlighted the intricacies of language generation and the importance of accuracy and attention to detail when dealing with linguistic tasks.

The discussion revolves around the exploration of language generation through the use of ChatGPT for crafting pangrams. The initial comment highlights the challenge of generating a novel pangram in Spanish using ChatGPT-4o due to missing letters and the importance of verifying each step. Further conversation delves into the intricacies of the process, including the technique of selecting random letters and ensuring grammatical correctness. Another reply reflects on the fascination with improving Language Model Tasks (LLMs) through specific strategies and effective utilization, emphasizing the need for thoughtful approaches to working with LLMs.

Moreover, the discussion addresses the importance of intelligently guiding language models like ChatGPT, rather than relying solely on random phrases, in order to generate successful pangrams. It also touches upon the significance of self-check mechanisms and contrasting the ability of LLMs to human reasoning. The engagement underscores the critical role of intelligence and problem-solving strategies in working with language models, emphasizing the need to consider constraints and possibilities step by step for effective outcomes.

By considering factors like the number of dimensions used internally and the spatial organization of image tokens, Looney offers insights into potential strategies employed by GPT-4o in handling image data.

From deciphering the significance of 170 tokens to speculating on the embedding approach for images, the piece navigates the intersection of machine learning and visual processing with a blend of analysis and speculation. The quest to unravel the mysteries of image encoding in GPT-4o presents a captivating journey through the intricate mechanisms of AI technology.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission about GPT-4o's image encoding ranges from comparisons with other OCR models to the implications of LLM (large language models) in AI development. Issues such as the intricacies of OCR models like PaddleOCR, the potential of VLM-1 for text parsing, and the limitations of OCR technology are highlighted. Additionally, there are discussions about OCR tools like PaddleOCR lacking comprehensive documentation, the challenges of handling document images effectively, and the potential application of VQVAE in image reconstruction. The conversation touches on topics like text extraction, model complexity, and the need for clear documentation in AI tools. Participants bring up various insights, suggestions, and points of view on AI technologies, OCR models, and image processing techniques.

### Microsoft will switch off Recall by default after security backlash

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/microsoft-recall-off-default-security-concerns/) | 544 points | by [georgehill](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=georgehill) | [479 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40610435)

Microsoft’s new Windows feature named Recall was intended to provide AI-enabled memory for devices, but it quickly faced criticism for its potential security and privacy risks. Recall, which silently stores screenshots of user activity every five seconds, was seen as preinstalled spyware that could expose sensitive information to hackers.  In response to mounting criticism, Microsoft announced significant changes to the Recall feature rollout. It will now be an opt-in feature in specific versions of Windows, with enhanced security measures such as data encryption and authentication requirements. These changes aim to address concerns raised by cybersecurity experts about the potential vulnerabilities of Recall-enabled devices.

Despite these improvements, some experts remain cautious about the risks associated with Recall. There are concerns about unresolved privacy issues, such as legal implications for users compelled to disclose their historical data. The rollback of the Recall feature reflects Microsoft’s ongoing struggle with cybersecurity incidents and breaches, leading the company to prioritize security in all business decisions. This incident highlights the challenges tech companies face in balancing innovation with security and privacy concerns. Microsoft’s Recall feature rollout serves as a cautionary tale of the importance of addressing cybersecurity issues proactively to maintain trust and user safety in the digital age.

### σ-GPTs: A new approach to autoregressive models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09562) | 276 points | by [mehulashah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mehulashah) | [74 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40608413)

The latest submission on Hacker News is a paper titled "σ-GPTs: A New Approach to Autoregressive Models" by Arnaud Pannatier and their colleagues. This paper challenges the traditional fixed order approach used in autoregressive models like the GPT family by introducing a method to modulate the generation order on-the-fly per sample. By adding positional encoding for output, this technique enables sampling and conditioning on specific token subsets, as well as dynamic sampling of multiple tokens at once based on a rejection strategy, resulting in a more efficient generation process across various domains. Check out the paper for more insights on this innovative approach in machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The discussion on the submission "σ-GPTs: A New Approach to Autoregressive Models" covers various aspects of the paper. Some users discuss the nuances of the proposed methodology, including the random permutation of training data, positional encodings, rejection sampling for generating multiple tokens at once, and the conditional probability distributions for missing tokens. 

There are comparisons made with other models like PixelCNN and XLNet, as well as clarifications on the differences between autoregressive models and the use of rejection sampling in model training. The discussion also touches on the practical applications of rejection sampling in large-scale text generation models and how it impacts the generation process.
