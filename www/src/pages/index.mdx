### LeanDojo: Theorem Proving in Lean Using LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://leandojo.org/) | 152 points | by [aseg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=aseg) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41096486)

In an exciting development for the world of theorem proving, researchers have introduced LeanDojo, a platform that harnesses the power of language models as copilots to automate proof generation in Lean—a popular theorem proving environment. LeanDojo offers users the ability to interact with their own models, whether they run locally or in the cloud, enhancing the proof process by suggestive tactics and premise retrieval.

At the heart of LeanDojo is the ReProver model, which employs a sophisticated encoder-decoder Transformer architecture to navigate the complexities of theorem proving. By utilizing an extensive benchmark dataset—comprised of nearly 100,000 theorems, along with tens of thousands of tactics and premises from Lean's rich math library—ReProver demonstrates remarkable capabilities, outperforming traditional built-in tactics as well as zero-shot attempts with models like GPT-4.

LeanDojo also creates a gym-like environment for theorem provers, facilitating interactions with proof states and tactics while providing feedback on errors or completion status. In addition to generating new proofs—discovering 33 previously unproven statements in miniF2F and 39 in ProofNet—it has been instrumental in uncovering formalization bugs.

A unique feature of LeanDojo is its integration with ChatGPT, offering users a more conversational approach to theorem proving. While ChatGPT can intersperse informal discussions with formal proof steps, it currently struggles with complex proofs compared to specialized models like ReProver.

With these advancements, LeanDojo paves the way for a new era in theorem proving, expanding the potential for both formal verification and mathematical exploration.

**Discussion Highlights:**

1. **Real-World Applications:** Commenters discussed the broader implications of theorem proving, particularly in fields requiring high security and reliability, such as banking. They highlighted the necessity of strong reasoning capabilities in AI to tackle complex challenges in these areas.
2. **Integration with Other Technologies:** Several participants noted LeanDojo's potential in connecting with existing systems like AlphaProof, calling attention to the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies in formal verification and proof generation.
3. **Proof and Problem Complexity:** The complexity associated with automated theorem proving was a recurring theme. Users expressed curiosity about how AI might handle intricate mathematical problems, referencing historical challenges like the Riemann Hypothesis.
4. **Conversational AI in Theorem Proving:** The integration of ChatGPT with LeanDojo was seen as an interesting step towards making theorem proving more accessible, despite current limitations in handling complex proofs compared to specialized AI models.
5. **Mathematical Discoveries and Challenges:** The discussion included insights about previous proofs and conjectures, including the ABC conjecture and its implications for complexity in formal mathematics. Community members questioned whether current systems could independently prove mathematical statements traditionally deemed difficult.
6. **Future Prospects:** The community reflected on the future of formal methods and AI in mathematics, considering the potential for groundbreaking discoveries and revisiting unresolved conjectures through new AI approaches.

This ongoing conversation emphasizes the excitement surrounding LeanDojo's capabilities and the potential enhancements to theorem proving and formal verification in mathematics and other fields.

### Big Tech says AI is booming. Wall Street is starting to see a bubble

#### [Submission URL](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/07/24/ai-bubble-big-tech-stocks-goldman-sachs/) | 71 points | by [jameslk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jameslk) | [86 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41087719)

A growing chorus of Wall Street analysts and tech investors is raising alarms about a potential financial bubble in artificial intelligence (AI), as massive investments from Big Tech, investors, and venture capitalists continue to pour in without clear signs of profitability. In recent discussions, Google CEO Sundar Pichai faced inquiries about when the company's hefty quarterly AI investments—amounting to $12 billion—might start yielding returns. Major institutions like Goldman Sachs and Barclays now caution that expenditures on AI could soon outpace the expected revenue, predicting a spending of around $60 billion by 2026 with only $20 billion in anticipated returns.

Amidst this skepticism, tech firms continuously assert the transformative potential of AI akin to that of the internet and mobile phones, with AI already enhancing tasks like document translation and email writing. However, analysts like Jim Covello of Goldman Sachs warn that current AI technologies are overhyped and may not be ready for widespread application, casting doubt on the long-term viability of extensive investments. Barclays emphasizes that despite the rush to develop new AI products, the reality may see fewer than the anticipated 12,000 successful applications emerging.

Vinod Khosla, a prominent Silicon Valley VC, echoes this sentiment, paralleling AI's trajectory with historical tech disruptions. While he acknowledges the risk of a bubble where many investors might lose money, he believes the foundational technology will ultimately thrive, predicting a future with multiple trillion-dollar AI enterprises.

Overall, as the AI landscape continues to evolve, the financial implications of these investments remain uncertain, with many stakeholders questioning whether the growth can match initial exuberance.

The discussion surrounding the potential AI bubble reflected various perspectives on the current investment climate and technological viability in the AI sector. Many commenters expressed skepticism about the sustainability of massive investments given the disparity between soaring expenditures and projected revenues. Some suggested that the expectations from AI technologies are inflated and might not manifest into profitable business models anytime soon.

Several users likened current trends to previous tech bubbles, questioning whether the excitement around AI is justified considering historical investment patterns in technology. The conversation highlighted the notion that while AI holds potential, it may not yet offer sufficient returns, with warnings about overreliance on speculative investments without adequate grounding in actual revenue generation.

Others believed that despite possible short-term bubbles, the underlying technology would eventually yield significant breakthroughs and companies that successfully integrate AI solutions could thrive, eventually generating substantial revenue. Contrasting the current excitement with past tech disruptions, opinion varied on whether the current levels of funding and hype would lead to a similar successful outcome or a regrettable market correction.

The dialogue exhibited a broad spectrum of opinions, from those cautious about the future of investments in AI to those optimistic about its transformative potential, indicating a complex and uncertain landscape as stakeholders navigate the promises and pitfalls of AI technology.
