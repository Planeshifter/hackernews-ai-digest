### Crafting formulas: Lambdas all the way down

#### [Submission URL](https://text.marvinborner.de/2024-04-16-10.html) | 119 points | by [marvinborner](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marvinborner) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41169244)

A new exploration in the world of the Bruijn programming language is pushing the boundaries of arithmetic with arbitrary precision. Following the insights of Reddit user u/DaVinci103, this project offers a compelling expansion to support not just integers, but also rational, real, and complex numbers encoded through lambda calculus. 

The beauty of this approach is its elegance and efficiency. In lambdas, integers can be represented seamlessly as Church numerals, while rational numbers take shape as pairs of balanced ternary numbers — allowing for negative values without increasing complexity. The big leap, however, is the implementation of real numbers, which previously stumped the author until inspiration struck via a fruitful Reddit post.

Breaking the implementation down, the author demystifies how to craft these mathematical operations from the ground up. For example, with rational numbers, you simply use two balanced ternary numbers while adhering to a non-zero denominator constraint. Through succinct syntax and clever use of combinatorial logic, the language can handle comparisons and calculations seamlessly.

The end result is a fascinating dive into Bruijn coding that not only showcases advanced arithmetic capabilities but also makes a case for how lambda calculus can elegantly simplify complex numerical systems. The author invites readers to explore these definitions and implementations, bringing both mathematical theory and pragmatic coding together in a way that is both informative and actionable. 

If you're intrigued by the intersection of programming, mathematics, and theoretical computing, this article is a must-read for grasping how to utilize Bruijn for advanced numerical manipulations.

The discussion thread following the submission on Bruijn programming language dives deep into various aspects and implications of representing numbers in advanced arithmetic with arbitrary precision. One participant, trmp, discusses the complexities of accurately approximating real numbers and suggests that the representation of natural numbers could lead to non-terminating approximations, which is necessary for certain computations. Similarly, cvss emphasizes the mathematical underpinnings where real numbers are viewed as a limit function, while also hinting at the complexities that arise with infinite series and functions.

mrvnbrnr contributes to the discourse by clarifying the project's aims and encouraging the exploration of mathematical concepts like differentiability within the context of the Bruijn language. Others, such as cryptnctr, echo appreciation for the nuanced programming techniques discussed, viewing them as practical solutions for number representation, especially in programming languages like Python.

Another recurring theme is the concern about the practicality of representing rational numbers and the implications of dealing with denominators, as noted by prrb and supported by mrkn, who clarify that managing zero as a denominator can complicate implementations. 

Overall, the conversation highlights a blend of programming language theory, mathematical intuition, and practical implementation, encouraging participants to explore the elegant representations of numbers and operations they can facilitate through the Bruijn language.
