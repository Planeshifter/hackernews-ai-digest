#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2024/04/16/a-quick-post-on-chens-algorithm/) | 248 points | by [feross](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=feross) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40056640)

Last week, the cryptography world was hit by a major revelation with the release of a new e-print by Yilei Chen, titled "Quantum Algorithms for Lattice Problems." This groundbreaking work has caused a stir in the cryptography research community as experts assess its implications for the field. The paper introduces a quantum algorithm that could potentially break encryption schemes based on specific lattice problems, posing a significant threat to current cryptographic systems.

Cryptographers commonly rely on hard mathematical problems to build secure encryption schemes, such as factoring, discrete logarithm, and elliptic curve discrete logarithm problems. While quantum computers are not yet powerful enough to crack these systems, the fear of future quantum attacks has prompted collaborative efforts to develop post-quantum cryptographic solutions. One outcome of this collaboration is the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography competition, which aims to standardize quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes. Lattice-based schemes, like Kyber and Dilithium, have emerged as popular choices in this competition due to their resistance to quantum attacks.

Chen's algorithm targets the "shortest independent vector problem" in lattices, potentially compromising certain encryption schemes. While the full impact of the algorithm is still being evaluated, there are concerns about its potential to render current lattice-based schemes obsolete, requiring a reimagining of post-quantum cryptography.

As experts delve into validating Chen's algorithm and its implications, the cryptography community braces for possible disruptive changes that could reshape the landscape of encryption.

This development raises important ethical and strategic questions about the future of warfare and the implications of relying on autonomous machines in armed conflicts.

- User "__lbracket__" jokingly references the Terminator movies in the context of the discussion about robots in warfare.
- User "gvmthkys" mentions self-guided flying drones.
- User "Log_out_" describes a scenario where machines resembling Lego sets are assembled with software to carry out missions, emphasizing the standardization and transformation of military operations.
- User "riku_iki" adds to this by discussing different types of drones with explosive payloads, critical zones, and projected power in warfare.
- User "cfcr" suggests that the USA might challenge other countries with revolutionary military strategies, potentially targeting democratically elected leftist leaders.
- User "brfbggns" expresses concerns about American military machines leading to physical and software genies (AI) tactically controlling capitalist networks, potentially causing revolutions, slavery, and wealth inequality.
- User "mtrngd" responds by discussing potential vulnerabilities in warfare systems that could be exploited, such as disabling communication infrastructure to gain tactical advantages.
- User "BriggyDwiggs42" humorously brings up the idea of sharing a limited luxury space in communism amidst discussions about strategic advantages in warfare.
