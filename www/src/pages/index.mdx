In the first ever Autonomous Racing League race, the excitement was palpable as driverless cars took to the track. However, the event was not without its challenges. The autonomous Dallara Super Formula racers faced difficulties during the qualifying time trials, with some cars struggling to complete a full lap, spinning out, colliding with walls, or even taking impromptu breaks on the track.

Despite these initial hurdles, the race eventually commenced, with the lead racer, Polimove, spinning out on the fourth lap, allowing Tum to take the lead and eventually win the race. The AI drivers demonstrated good sportsmanship by obeying the rules, such as not passing each other during caution laps.

While the current state of autonomous racing may be akin to congratulating a baby for feeding itself, it is clear that progress is being made in the field. As technology continues to advance, we can look forward to seeing self-driving racers evolve and improve their performance in the future.
