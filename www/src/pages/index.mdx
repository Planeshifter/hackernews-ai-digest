Amazon faced scrutiny over the use of AI technology in its physical grocery stores, specifically the "Just Walk Out" system that allows customers to grab items and leave without going through a traditional checkout process. Reports revealed that the system required manual checking of transactions by workers in India, leading to questions about the accuracy of Amazon's claims about the technology.

This incident highlighted a broader issue of "AI washing," where companies may exaggerate the capabilities of their AI systems for marketing or competitive purposes. The term refers to the practice of making inflated claims about AI usage, similar to "green washing" in environmental contexts.

As the use of AI becomes more prevalent in various industries, there is a growing concern about companies misrepresenting their AI capabilities. Some startups may feel pressured to incorporate AI into their pitches to attract investment, even if the technology's role in their solutions is minimal. This trend has caught the attention of investors and regulators, with the US Securities and Exchange Commission taking action against firms for false statements about their AI use.

The lack of a clear definition of AI and the ambiguity surrounding its usage contribute to the problem of AI washing. This trend not only poses risks for businesses and investors but also has the potential to erode consumer trust in innovative companies genuinely leveraging AI technology. Regulators in both the US and the UK are starting to address this issue through existing laws and codes of conduct, aiming to prevent misleading claims about AI capabilities in marketing communications.
