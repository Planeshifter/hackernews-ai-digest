### Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life) | 235 points | by [EvgeniyZh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EvgeniyZh) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44308711)

Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of AI's problem-solving prowess with a groundbreaking study by Toby Ord and insights from the METR organization. This research takes a fresh look at how AI agents perform over time on complex tasks, uncovering intriguing patterns in their success rates.

The study builds on the empirical work of researchers Kwa et al. (2025) and introduces a pivotal concept: a constant failure rate model. According to this model, AI agents have a fixed probability of failing each minute on tasks, similar to how radioactive substances decay over time. This leads to an "exponential decline" in success rates as task duration increases, allowing AI tasks to be characterized by their "half-life." This simplified model makes it possible to predict how well an AI agent might perform on tasks of varying lengths, sparking curiosity about the underlying reasons for their success or failure on longer assignments.

METR’s study of AI agent capabilities offers eye-opening data. They've discovered an exponential improvement trend in the duration of tasks that AI can handle, noting a remarkable aspect: every seven months, the task length that AI can reliably solve doubles. These benchmarks include tasks from software engineering, cybersecurity, general reasoning, and machine learning, showcasing improvements in AI agents' ability to assist in research.

To measure performance, METR uses a 50% success rate threshold to establish a benchmark for reliability. Though higher success rates like 80% or an almost perfect 99.9999% would be ideal for practical applications, their current focus allows them to track a clear trend in AI improvements. Notably, the doubling of capabilities at the 50% success rate closely mirrors the 80% rate, implying broader implications for AI advancement.

Yet, the study raises important questions about the generalizability of these results beyond the task suite. While AI outshines humans in some lengthy, complex calculations, humans still outpace AI in tasks requiring spatial reasoning or physical intuition. Furthermore, factors such as automated scoring, lack of interaction with other agents, and resource constraints could skew the perceived improvements.

The discussion dives deeper with survival analysis, a field focusing on how failure probabilities evolve over time, offering further insights into AI's growing capabilities. The idea that an AI could tackle an 8-hour task but not a 16-hour one prompts fascinating questions about its functioning and task segmentation.

Ultimately, this research offers a novel lens through which to gauge AI's advancements, though acknowledging its current limits. As future work explores other domains and tasks, understanding AI's development through these multifaceted measures could unlock its full potential in problem-solving.

### Real-time action chunking with large models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pi.website/research/real_time_chunking) | 42 points | by [pr337h4m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pr337h4m) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44303021)

In the fast-paced world of robotics, staying a step ahead—literally—is not just advantageous, it's vital. A robot missing a beat could spill your coffee or scramble crucial tasks like plugging in an Ethernet cable. In a captivating new study, Kevin Black, Manuel Y. Galliker, and Sergey Levine dive into the nuances of Real-Time Action Chunking with Large Models, crafting a strategy to tackle the urgent need for real-time execution in autonomous systems.

The primary challenge hinges on the asynchrony of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). Moving beyond the realms of static text and image generation, these models operate in real time—meaning they must think and act simultaneously. Current methods like action chunking deliver multiple consecutive actions per inference cycle, which is crucial but problematic. These chunks often lead to discontinuities between old and new actions, resulting in stuttering motion or even catastrophic errors.

Enter Real-Time Chunking (RTC): an inventive algorithm that harmonizes execution in a way that is both smooth and adaptable to change. Unlike older approaches that pause to process the next action chunk—awkwardly freezing our robot at the end of each cycle—RTC keeps the robot moving seamlessly, removing the dreaded hiccup between chunks.

RTC treats the transition between action chunks as an inpainting problem, akin to filling in missing parts of an image. By retaining some actions from the previous chunk while overlaying them with new, updated inputs, the algorithm transitions smoothly between different movements. This methodology not only preserves consistency but also adapts to new data—allowing VLAs to stay synchronously agile with the world around them, regardless of any imposed latency.

Tests reveal RTC's prowess, even with artificial delays exceeding 300 milliseconds. Tasks that demand precision and swift adaptation are no longer slowed down by cumbersome inference pauses. Instead, RTC ensures that robots can both think and act on the go—drawing from a blend of learned intuition and current information without requiring additional training.

This new frontier in robotics, as demonstrated by the team's work, promises to revolutionize task execution—a leap towards a future where robots handle dynamic environments with the grace and precision akin to human coordination, no matter the computational limits. From everyday errands to complex interactions, RTC could redefine the relationship between machines and the fluid, ever-changing world they navigate.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion highlights enthusiasm for the research on Real-Time Chunking (RTC), with users expressing excitement about its implications for robotics. One user mentions building a robot project and praises the work, while another notes RTC’s ability to handle 300ms+ delays in tasks like plugging Ethernet cables and stabilizing control loops.

A commenter also shares an open-source resource (Physical Intelligence’s [OpenPi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)) for Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), suggesting community-driven tools to explore the concepts further. Overall, the conversation blends technical admiration, practical use-case considerations, and resource recommendations.

### Building Effective AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) | 481 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301809)

In an insightful post, Anthropic shares valuable lessons gained from collaborating with numerous teams across various industries on building large language model (LLM) agents. Published on December 19, 2024, the post debunks the myth that complex frameworks are always necessary for successful LLM implementations. Instead, it highlights that simple, composable patterns are often the key to building effective agents.

**Defining Agents vs. Workflows**: Anthropic distinguishes between "workflow" and "agent" systems. While workflows rely on predefined code paths to structure LLM and tool orchestration, agents are capable of dynamically directing their own processes and tool usage, allowing for greater adaptability and decision-making potential. The discussion provides a nuanced understanding of when to opt for these agentic systems—balancing the trade-off between complexity, latency, and task performance.

**Framework Usage and Simplicity**: The post advises developers to stick to LLM APIs for a straightforward implementation before considering frameworks like LangChain's LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent, or GUI tools like Rivet and Vellum. Overreliance on frameworks might introduce unnecessary complexity and obscure the core processes. Ensuring you comprehend what's under the hood is crucial to prevent common errors.

**Key Patterns and Implementations**: Anthropic delves into specific agentic patterns, starting with the foundational augmented LLM, which enriches standard capabilities with retrieval, tools, and memory. These augmented LLMs are essential in both workflows and more autonomous agentic systems, offering developers the flexibility to tailor solutions to specific needs.

1. **Prompt Chaining Workflow**: This pattern decomposes tasks into manageable steps, where each LLM call builds on the previous one. It’s particularly beneficial for tasks that can be neatly segmented, trading latency for accuracy.
   
2. **Routing Workflow**: Ideal for tasks that can be categorized, routing directs inputs to specialized processes, enhancing specialization without compromising performance across varied task types.

The post emphasizes a pragmatic approach: use the simplest solution possible for your LLM applications and only introduce agentic complexity when absolutely necessary. This methodology ensures not only efficiency but also adaptability across diverse application domains.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's insights on LLM agents and frameworks reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Frameworks vs. Simplicity**:  
   - Many agree with the article’s emphasis on starting simple, avoiding overcomplication with frameworks like LangChain or Bedrock. Critics argue frameworks often introduce unnecessary abstraction, runtime errors (e.g., LangChain’s JSON blobs and weak typing in Python), and obscure core processes.  
   - Counterpoints suggest frameworks *can* aid in observability, security, and cross-vendor LLM compatibility, but only if their internals are well-understood.  

2. **Workflows vs. Agents**:  
   - Debate arises over Anthropic’s definitions. Some argue modern workflow engines (e.g., temporal.io) are already dynamic, blurring the line between workflows and agents. Others clarify workflows enforce structured, predictable paths (e.g., refund processes), while agents handle open-ended tasks with autonomy (e.g., customer service).  
   - A historical correction notes "workflow" has long been a software term, not newly defined by Anthropic.

3. **Implementation Challenges**:  
   - Cost and latency: Multi-agent systems (e.g., 6 agents per query) can become prohibitively expensive ($2/query) and complex to orchestrate.  
   - Technical hurdles: Prompt injection vulnerabilities, regression in newer models (e.g., Gemini), and accidental costs from conversational history bloat are noted.  
   - Sub-agents and concurrency: Some share examples of using Claude for sub-tasks (e.g., research, code patches) but highlight the lack of standardized frameworks for parallel tool calls.

4. **Real-World Use Cases**:  
   - Success stories: One user’s company built a scalable agent system from scratch using LangGraph, contradicting the article’s framework skepticism. Others advocate for hybrid approaches—simple patterns for core logic, with frameworks added only for specific needs (e.g., observability).

### LLMs pose an interesting problem for DSL designers

#### [Submission URL](https://kirancodes.me/posts/log-lang-design-llms.html) | 202 points | by [gopiandcode](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gopiandcode) | [132 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44302797)

The landscape of programming language design is rapidly evolving with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In a recent discussion, "Programming Language Design in the Era of LLMs: A Return to Mediocrity?", the tension between traditional domain-specific languages (DSLs) and the capabilities of LLMs is explored, posing an intriguing question about the future of language design.

Historically, programming languages have been meticulously crafted to provide a syntax and semantics that align with the intuitions and needs of specific domains. This specialization has allowed developers to focus on solving complex problems without being bogged down by repetitive code or potential errors. DSLs, like the example provided for video game dialogue, make incorrect programming almost impossible and minimize bugs by embedding domain-specific rules directly into the language itself.

However, with the advent of LLMs from companies like ChatGPT and CoPilot, the need for specially crafted languages is in question. LLMs can generate diverse code snippets, removing boilerplate concerns without requiring specialized languages. These models perform exceptionally well with widely used languages like Python, but struggle with more niche languages, impacting the development and utility of DSLs.

This raises a critical challenge: will the ease and flexibility offered by LLMs overshadow the benefits of DSLs? The worry is that DSL development might stagnate if they entail losing the ability to use LLM-generated code.

Despite these concerns, there are optimistic paths forward. One approach is training LLMs specifically for DSLs, potentially integrating them with more commonly used languages like Python to enhance their understanding and utility. This collaboration could bridge the gap between DSLs and LLM efficiency, encouraging a future where bespoke language design and LLMs coexist, expanding the horizons of what is possible in software development.

As technology evolves, the conversation remains open. The balance between human-led language design and machine-driven code generation continues to be a fertile ground for innovation, prompting ongoing exploration and collaboration among developers and researchers.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the evolving role of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in the context of LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot. Here are the key points:

### **Tension Between LLMs and DSLs**
1. **DSL Strengths vs. LLM Flexibility**:  
   DSLs historically reduce errors and simplify domain-specific tasks (e.g., game dialogue scripting), but LLMs are now challenging this by generating boilerplate-free code in general-purpose languages like Python. Users note LLMs struggle with niche or newer DSLs due to limited training data, potentially discouraging DSL adoption.

2. **Stagnation Concerns**:  
   Some fear widespread LLM use could push developers toward established languages/frameworks (e.g., Python, React) at the expense of DSL innovation. Custom protocols or DSL-specific logic might be sidelined if LLMs prioritize popular, well-documented tools.

### **Potential Solutions and Optimism**
- **Training LLMs for DSLs**:  
  Proposals include fine-tuning LLMs on DSLs or integrating DSLs into mainstream frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, JSX) to make them LLM-friendly. Regex was cited as a DSL success story where LLMs perform well due to abundant examples.  
- **Embedded DSLs**:  
  Frameworks like React’s JSX or LINQ in C# show how DSLs embedded within host languages can thrive, balancing expressiveness with LLM compatibility.  

### **Historical and Linguistic Parallels**
- **Compiler History**:  
  Past compiler optimizations (e.g., Fran Allen’s work) faced similar trade-offs between high-level abstractions and low-level efficiency, mirroring today’s DSL-LLM tension.  
- **Language Standardization**:  
  Comparisons were drawn to natural language evolution (e.g., post-printing press English standardization), suggesting LLMs might accelerate programming language homogenization.  

### **Criticisms and Skepticism**
- **Code Quality**:  
  Users debated whether LLM-generated code would lead to “disposable” or verbose output, increasing maintenance costs. Skilled programmers may still be needed to refine AI code into efficient abstractions.  
- **Adoption Challenges**:  
  Niche domains like game engine shaders or hardware-specific logic (e.g., iOS features) may resist LLM-driven shifts if training data is sparse.  

### **Futuristic Speculation**
- **AI-Driven Ecosystems**:  
  Jokes about “Skynet” aside, some posited that future AI systems might use higher-level DSLs for efficiency, reducing token overhead and enabling faster iteration.  

**Conclusion**: While LLMs risk sidelining DSLs by favoring mainstream tools, collaborative approaches—integrating DSLs into frameworks, targeted LLM training, and leveraging embedded patterns—offer hope for coexistence. The debate underscores ongoing balancing acts between innovation, practicality, and the evolving role of AI in software design.

### Time Series Forecasting with Graph Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://kumo.ai/research/time-series-forecasting/) | 112 points | by [turntable_pride](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=turntable_pride) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301998)

The exploration of time series forecasting through graph-structured data has taken center stage, emerging as a crucial tool for modern businesses strategies. Most of our world’s data resides in relational databases, making this topic particularly relevant.

In traditional setups, time series forecasting often occurs in isolation—tapping into the sequence of past data points to predict future ones. However, many real-world scenarios indicate the value of integrating related data sources, such as marketing campaigns or economic indicators, is often underestimated. Steps toward harnessing this interconnectedness involve leveraging graphs, which naturally depict the relationships between various data points, allowing a deeper dive into relational structures.

The process involves converting relational tables from databases into graph structures using Relational Deep Learning (RDL) to convert these into node-led entities with features crucial for forecasting on subsets of these nodes. This transformation aligns with the need for graph-based learning methods, such as Graph Transformers, to robustly predict outcomes influenced by myriad interconnected data points.

Consider an example where forecasting daily sales of products is augmented by incorporating tables of transactions, customers, and marketing efforts. The RDL scheme turns these interconnections into a formidable graph, enriching each node with features leveraging the underlying relationships.

An essential aspect of this endeavor is melding various signals — including graph, past sequence, date-time, and calendar encodings — within a cohesive forecasting framework. For instance, date-time and calendar encodings enable models to account for recurring seasonal patterns, holidays, or unexpected spikes. Meanwhile, past sequence encodings help encode the history, vital for capturing prevailing trends.

The architecture synergizes these elements, using embeddings from both past data and graph structures to predict future events. Graph encodings, drawn from a temporal subgraph sampling process, allow scaling the model's influence to real-world proprieties, emulating a nuanced prediction vehicle capable of digesting diverse relational signals.

By pivoting towards graph-based forecasting models like this, businesses can mine deeper insights from their relational data lakes. This not only aids in fortifying future predictions but also in recognizing the layered narratives told by interconnected data, culminating in a richer, data-driven decision-making process.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the use of **Transformers and graph-based methods for time series forecasting**, with polarized opinions on their effectiveness and practicality. Key themes include:

In a significant move for AI and defense collaboration, the U.S. Defense Department has awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to enhance national security with frontier artificial intelligence models. This partnership, named "OpenAI for Government," marks a new milestone for the company as it ventures into national defense arenas, aiming to prototype AI capabilities that could revolutionize warfighting and administrative operations for the military.

The contract, announced on Monday, will see most of the work taking place around Washington, D.C., and involves collaboration with Anduril, a defense tech startup that received its own $100 million contract last December. This aligns with recent industry trends where AI and tech companies are increasingly engaging with national defense projects. For instance, Anthropic is working with Palantir and Amazon for similar purposes.

OpenAI's involvement will focus on developing AI tools that streamline military operations and improve service delivery, such as healthcare for service members and proactive cyber defenses—all while adhering to OpenAI's usage policies.

OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, emphasized the importance of their role in national security during a discussion at Vanderbilt University. The initiative underscores OpenAI's commitment to providing the government with cutting-edge AI solutions while expanding its influence and capabilities in the public sector.

Moreover, as part of a broader effort to bolster AI infrastructure within the U.S., OpenAI is also involved in the $500 billion Stargate project, aiming to expand computing power domestically. With the company already generating over $10 billion in annual sales, this contract represents a strategic but smaller fraction of its overall operations.

As this contract kicks off, the collaboration between OpenAI and the U.S. Defense Department could set a precedent for future public-private partnerships in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence and defense technology.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

Critics argue that such partnerships often prioritize corporate profits over ethical considerations or public benefit.

2. **Debate Over $200M Contract’s Significance:**  
   - Many dismiss the $200M contract as a trivial expense within the **$1 trillion annual military budget** (just 0.02%), comparing it to “30 cents in a $3 transaction.”  
   - Others counter that even small amounts reflect systemic waste and “theater,” arguing contracts like these funnel taxpayer money into private hands with minimal accountability. The **Stargate project** ($500B for AI infrastructure) is cited as a larger example of unchecked spending.

3. **Government Inefficiency & Corruption Concerns:**  
   - Users criticize the DoD’s reliance on outdated software (e.g., Excel, PowerPoint) and question the wisdom of funding AI projects before addressing basic inefficiencies.  
   - Some allege widespread corruption, with contracts serving as tools for “rent-seeking” by politically connected firms. References to **Peter Thiel** (co-founder of Palantir) and the “military-industrial complex” underscore fears of a self-perpetuating system.

4. **Broader Military Spending Critiques:**  
   - Comments highlight a paradox: despite massive budgets, projects often fail to deliver proportional value. The **Broken Window Fallacy** is invoked to critique spending that generates activity without meaningful returns.  
   - Comparisons to India’s cost-effective space program ($1B annually) contrast with perceived U.S. bloat, though defenders argue cutting-edge tech is necessary for national security.

5. **Mixed Perspectives on AI’s Role:**  
   - While some view AI as essential for modern defense (e.g., cyber warfare, logistics), others see OpenAI’s involvement as symbolic of Silicon Valley’s complicity in “privatizing gains while socializing risks.”  
   - A vocal minority defends the contract as pragmatic, emphasizing that even small investments in AI could yield strategic advantages.

**Overall Sentiment:**  
The discussion leans skeptical, with users questioning the ethics, efficacy, and oversight of military-tech partnerships. However, there is acknowledgment of the complex trade-offs between innovation, national security, and fiscal responsibility. Memes and shorthand (e.g., “Lt. Col PowerPoint commissions”) reflect frustration with bureaucracy, while broader critiques of corporate influence in government recur throughout.

### Breaking Quadratic Barriers: A Non-Attention LLM for Ultra-Long Context Horizons

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01963) | 64 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44292601)

A groundbreaking paper has just emerged from the world of machine learning, authored by Andrew Kiruluta, Preethi Raju, and Priscilla Burity, tackling one of the biggest hurdles in large language models (LLMs). Traditional Transformers, which have been the backbone of recent AI developments, suffer from quadratic memory and computational constraints due to their reliance on self-attention mechanisms. This new research, intriguingly titled "Breaking Quadratic Barriers: A Non-Attention LLM for Ultra-Long Context Horizons," proposes a fresh architecture that breaks free from these limitations.

Their approach completely skips token-to-token attention, instead using state space blocks inspired by S4 to learn continuous time convolution kernels, enabling near-linear scaling with sequence length. The model also uses multi-resolution convolution layers to capture local context at varying dilation levels, alongside a lightweight recurrent supervisor that maintains a global hidden state. Complementing these are retrieval-augmented external memory mechanisms that store and recall high-level chunk embeddings without backtracking into quadratic operations.

This innovative model provides a remarkable breakthrough for LLMs, potentially handling context windows comprising hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens efficiently. It's a significant leap forward for applications that demand processing stunningly vast swaths of text, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language processing. This work, now accessible on arXiv, could shape the next generation of language models and inspire further research into non-attention-based architectures.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the non-attention-based LLM paper:

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Cautious Optimism**:  
   Users acknowledge the **potential** of replacing quadratic self-attention with linear-time alternatives (e.g., state-space models, FFT-based methods) to handle **million-token contexts**. However, many stress the need for **large-scale experiments** to validate real-world performance, as current results show only **minor improvements** in metrics like perplexity.

2. **Practical Bottlenecks**:  
   Critics argue that **memory and compute** during inference (e.g., MLP layers, KV-caching) often dominate costs more than self-attention. Even with linear scaling, handling ultra-long sequences may remain impractical due to **fixed batch costs** or hardware constraints.

3. **Attention vs. Non-Attention Tradeoffs**:  
   While avoiding token-to-token attention reduces complexity, some speculate the model may still **implicitly use attention** in hybrid architectures (e.g., DeepSeek’s design). Others note that preserving attention-like mechanisms might be crucial for **reasoning tasks** (e.g., QA, summarization), where existing attention models still excel.

4. **Comparisons & Alternatives**:  
   Users cite similar efforts like **Mamba, MesaNet, and Gated DeltaNet**, suggesting non-attention architectures are a growing trend. However, commercial models (Gemini, GPT-4) already support million-token windows, while open-source alternatives (Llama 3/4) lag behind.

5. **Paper Criticisms**:  
   Skepticism arose about the paper’s **vagueness**, lack of technical detail, and possible reliance on **AI-generated text**. Critics demand clearer explanations of the architecture, ablation studies, and comparisons to baseline models.

---

### Notable Technical Debates:
- **KV-Caching**: Linear-time key-value caching (O(N)) vs. FFT-based attention (O(N log N)) as alternatives to quadratic scaling.  
- **Hybrid Models**: Whether "attention-free" architectures secretly reintroduce attention in specific layers (e.g., chunk-boundary mechanisms).  
- **Cost Dynamics**: Debates on whether ultra-long contexts will remain prohibitively expensive even with linear scaling, due to **hardware or memory bandwidth limits**.

### Final Takeaway:  
While the work is seen as a **promising research direction**, the community urges more empirical validation, transparency, and comparisons to state-of-the-art attention variants before declaring a breakthrough.

### Jokes and Humour in the Public Android API

#### [Submission URL](https://voxelmanip.se/2025/06/14/jokes-and-humour-in-the-public-android-api/) | 283 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [166 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44285781)

In the intricate dance of Android development, sometimes humor shines through in unexpected places. A recent dive into the public APIs has uncovered a treasure trove of whimsical touches, whispered inside jokes, and Easter eggs that nudge developers with a wink and a nod. Here’s a peek into some of the quirkiest elements that remind us that even tech giants like Google know how to have fun.

**Monkeying Around with `isUserAMonkey()`**  
Originally sounding like a line from a comedic script, `ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey()` isn't entirely a joke. This method returns true if an UI test tool, the Monkey, is currently active. It originated from a mishap during Android's development when errant inputs from the Monkey dialed 911. This light-hearted but useful feature was incorporated to prevent similar incidents by restricting certain actions when testing.

**A Goat-y Reference in `isUserAGoat()`**  
On the more frivolous side, this method playfully checks whether the user is, well, a goat. Originally it always returned false until Android Lollipop, aligning its behavior with the craze around the Goat Simulator game. It would detect the game’s presence and remarkably return true, preserving goat dignity even further. As app privacy became stricter in Android 11, this method reverted to a constant false, hinting at serious data protection—or goat privacy, as it were.

**Fun is Disallowed with UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN**  
Adding to the comedic flair, there's a policy constant, `UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN`, hilariously described in documentation as preventing the user from experiencing joy on the device. Although a legitimate policy to control device usage, the tongue-in-cheek description suggests that Android developers occasionally take a page from the playbook of GLaDOS, the snarky AI from Portal.

**It's the Final Countdown**  
One of the hidden gems in Android Oreo’s API was a method `Chronometer.isTheFinalCountdown()`, audaciously opening YouTube to play Europe’s classic hit "The Final Countdown." This playful intrusion of rock nostalgia into programming underscores a delightful irreverence, embracing both technology and culture narratives.

**Jazz Hands and Multitouch Jazz**  
Devices capable of tracking five touch inputs are referenced by the charmingly named constant `PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND`. This humorous nod to Jazz hands dances its way back to the Gingerbread days, illustrating Android's long history of lighthearted creativity.

**Logging Woes with `Log.wtf()`**  
To express utter disbelief or unexpected failure, there's `Log.wtf()`, cheekily expanded to "What a Terrible Failure." It logs anomalies so catastrophic that the developers might as well say "what the … you know the rest."

**Hosts and KThx**  
Finally, the method `AdapterViewFlipper.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()` comes with an eye-catching casual identifier, reminiscent of informal internet exchanges. Although its function is quite straightforward, the naming choice remains a delightful Easter egg for techies who enjoy a little chuckle in their code.

These delightful snippets of humor hidden within Android's APIs offer a rare insight into the personalities of its creators. As changes in technology and privacy continue to drive evolution, these amusing elements reflect a balance between utility and a shared joy found in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion expands on the original post's theme of humor in APIs, sharing examples from various systems and debating the balance between levity and professionalism:

1. **Humorous Naming Across Tech:**  
   - React's `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` and extensions like `..._INTO_THE_SUN` illustrate playful warnings.  
   - Haiku OS’s `is_computer_on` and `is_computer_on_fire`, along with Delphi’s `EProgrammerNotFound` exception, showcase dry humor in documentation.  
   - Legacy references like X11’s `party_like_its_1989` variable and Android’s `runWithScissors()` method highlight historical whimsy.  

2. **Security Concerns:**  
   - Hidden Easter eggs in public APIs or undocumented code can introduce risks. One user shared a story where a hidden music-playing feature (triggered by a key combo) was mistaken for a backdoor, highlighting the fine line between fun and vulnerabilities.  
   - Security teams often discourage such elements to avoid expanding the attack surface.  

3. **Anecdotes & Cultural Impact:**  
   - A contractor’s tale recalled a project where a crude template filename (`MOOL.bs`) led to client confusion and a security audit scare.  
   - Chrome’s task manager once listed "teleported goats" in its columns, amusing users until removed.  

4. **Balancing Humor and Professionalism:**

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) | 294 points | by [stephen_g](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stephen_g) | [258 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44286277)

A groundbreaking study featured on arXiv examines the neural and behavioral impacts of using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in essay writing. Conducted by Nataliya Kosmyna and her team, the research highlights a potential downside to relying on AI assistants: the accumulation of cognitive debt. Participants were divided into LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only groups for three sessions, with some swapping roles in a fourth session. EEG analyses revealed that LLM users demonstrated the weakest brain connectivity, while Brain-only participants showed the strongest. Interestingly, when LLM users were switched to the Brain-only task, they exhibited reduced cognitive engagement, suggesting a concerning decline in mental agility. This study uncovers the cognitive costs of LLM convenience, raising serious questions about the educational implications of becoming too dependent on AI tools. It emphasizes the need for a careful reevaluation of AI's role in learning environments, as consistent reliance on LLMs might impair neural, linguistic, and behavioral performance over time. This study prompts a more profound investigation into how AI shapes our learning processes and cognitive health.

The discussion surrounding the study on LLMs' cognitive impacts reveals a nuanced debate about the role of AI in communication, education, and critical thinking. Key points include:

1. **Cognitive Decline Concerns**:  
   Critics argue that over-reliance on LLMs risks fostering shallow thinking, reduced problem-solving depth, and "cognitive debt." Users like **mjbrgss** warn that substituting human reasoning with algorithms erodes adaptability and decision-making skills, particularly in educational settings where students may bypass critical analysis.

2. **Business Communication Dynamics**:  
   Participants debate the value of human vs. AI-generated communication. **cddck** and **bonoboTP** highlight underrated skills like crafting persuasive narratives, tailoring arguments for technical/non-technical audiences, and navigating social dynamics. They note that even talented engineers often struggle with clear communication, emphasizing the irreplaceable role of human nuance.

3. **LLMs as Tools, Not Replacements**:  
   While **je42** praises LLMs for improving writing efficiency (e.g., grammar corrections, structural suggestions), others caution against overuse. **byndrh** warns that tools like Grammarly can strip writing of personal style, and **bsnftnr** stresses that AI should augment—not replace—critical thinking or Socratic learning methods.

4. **Institutional Complacency**:  
   **mjbrgss** and **Al-Khwarizmi** discuss how institutions might misuse LLMs for bureaucratic tasks, prioritizing speed over depth. This could entrench superficial processes, reducing incentives for rigorous analysis unless external pressures demand it.

5. **Social and Educational Trade-offs**:  
   **hnsmyr** critiques real-time LLM use in conversations, noting it leads to formulaic, "bullet-point" interactions that lack depth. Meanwhile, **Ekaros** hints at broader societal implications of outsourcing communication to AI.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores a tension between efficiency gains from LLMs and the potential erosion of human cognitive and communicative depth. While AI tools offer practical benefits, participants stress the need to preserve critical thinking, creativity, and the uniquely human ability to navigate complex social and intellectual landscapes.

### Salesforce study finds LLM agents flunk CRM and confidentiality tests

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/06/16/salesforce_llm_agents_benchmark/) | 142 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44289554)

A recent study led by Salesforce's AI researcher Kung-Hsiang Huang has unveiled notable shortcomings in Large Language Model (LLM) agents when it comes to performing standard CRM tasks and safeguarding customer confidentiality. Despite the potential high-margin opportunities AI agents represent for CRM vendors like Salesforce, the research highlighted through a new benchmark tool, CRMArena-Pro, that LLM agents have about a 58% success rate for single-step tasks and a dismal 35% for complex, multi-step ones. Moreover, these AI agents struggle with understanding the importance of confidential data, which dampens their task performance despite improvements through targeted prompting.

This revelation underscores a gap between AI capabilities and real-world enterprise demands, suggesting that organizations should tread carefully before fully banking on AI enhancements. While efficiency-driven entities like the UK government aim to leverage AI for substantial savings, proving tangible benefits remains crucial. As the landscape develops, stakeholders are urged to measure AI's potential realistically, not just as an efficiency booster but also concerning its readiness for handling sensitive data responsibly. Stay tuned as AI integration continues to evolve, promising yet unexplored territories for both vendors and users.

The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and ethical concerns of deploying LLMs in enterprise CRM tasks, as highlighted by Salesforce's study. Key points include:

1. **Technical Limitations**:  
   - LLMs show modest success rates (58% for single-step tasks, 35% for multi-step), sparking debates about whether these metrics reflect a "coin-flip" reliability.  
   - Participants question benchmarks, with analogies like drawing marbles from a jar to explain statistical success probabilities. Skepticism arises about whether current performance justifies enterprise reliance.  

2. **Data Privacy & Ethics**:  
   - Confidentiality risks are noted, with suggestions like RAG layers to mitigate data exposure.  
   - A heated sub-thread debates data scraping legality, contrasting terms like “stealing” vs. “unlicensed use.” Critics argue LLM training on public data may infringe copyrights, while others dismiss this as semantic pedantry.  

3. **Model Behavior**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs’ verbosity (e.g., Gemini) and tendency to “hallucinate” or persist in conversations, leading to false promises or misleading answers. Examples include chatbots offering incorrect discounts.  

4. **Industry Realism vs. Hype**:  
   - Participants push back against AI hype, emphasizing the gap between marketing claims and real-world performance. Competitors like HubSpot’s ChatGPT integration are cited as examples of rushed, overhyped solutions.  

5. **Communication Clarity**:  
   - Users stress the need for brevity and precision in LLM responses, noting that unclear outputs burden human oversight and erode trust.  

Overall, the discussion underscores cautious optimism, urging realistic expectations, improved transparency, and ethical frameworks as AI evolves in enterprise contexts.
