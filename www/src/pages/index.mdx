### Two-Tower Embedding Model

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hopsworks.ai/dictionary/two-tower-embedding-model) | 72 points | by [jamesblonde](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jamesblonde) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37631225)

The two-tower embedding model is a powerful method for connecting embeddings in two different modalities, such as images and text, by placing them in the same vector space. It is commonly used in personalized recommendation systems, where items and user histories are the two modalities. The model is trained by creating training data that "grounds" the modalities, such as matching captions to images. By mapping the embeddings from different modalities into the same space, the model can generate personalized recommendations based on user history and context. The architecture of a two-tower model consists of a query tower and an item tower, each encoding different features to create embeddings. The models are trained jointly using user queries and item interactions. Hopsworks is a platform that can be used to manage the collection and usage of feature data when building two-tower models. While most two-tower models connect two modalities, ongoing research is exploring the extension of this approach to more modalities.

### CoRF: Colorizing Radiance Fields Using Knowledge Distillation

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07668) | 59 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37634018)

Researchers from the field of Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition have developed a method called CoRF for colorizing radiance fields using knowledge distillation. Neural radiance field (NeRF) based methods allow for high-quality novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, when applying image or video-based colorization methods to the generated grayscale novel views, artifacts due to inconsistency across views can occur. The researchers propose a distillation-based method that transfers color knowledge from existing 2D colorization methods to the radiance field network. Experimental results show that the proposed method produces superior colorized novel views while maintaining cross-view consistency. The method is also effective for colorizing radiance field networks trained from infrared (IR) multi-view images and old grayscale multi-view image sequences. This research has significant implications for improving the quality and consistency of synthesized images in computer vision applications.

### Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01603) | 65 points | by [beefman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beefman) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37627615)

A new research paper titled "Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization" proposes a machine learning model that aims to achieve systematic generalization, a human-like ability to learn compositional rules from limited data and apply them to unseen combinations in various domains. The authors introduce the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR), which utilizes a Grounded Symbol System (GSS) with combinatorial syntax and semantics. NSR consists of separate modules for neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning, which are jointly learned using a deduction-abduction algorithm. The researchers demonstrate that NSR achieves superior systematic generalization on three benchmarks from different domains: semantic parsing, string manipulation, and arithmetic reasoning. NSR outperforms state-of-the-art models on the arithmetic reasoning benchmark by approximately 23%. The authors attribute NSR's strong generalization to its symbolic representation and inductive biases, as well as its better transferability compared to existing neural-symbolic approaches. The paper provides insights into how NSR can effectively model various sequence-to-sequence tasks.

The discussion on this submission started with a comment pointing out that existing machine learning models often fail to achieve human-like systematic generalization. The commenter also mentions a recent paper published by the creators of ChatGPT, reinforcing the relevance of the topic. Another commenter responds, expressing their belief that the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR) mentioned in the submission is similar to an existing model called MoE (Mixture of Experts). They suggest that the NSR implementation might be costly compared to the MoE approach, but it is not clear from the comment why this is the case.

### Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors Are Universal Learners

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06979) | 91 points | by [dataminer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dataminer) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37619513)

Researchers have discovered that auto-regressive next-token predictors, such as language models, have the ability to solve complex tasks involving logical and mathematical reasoning. In a recent study, Eran Malach presented a theoretical framework for studying these predictors and showed that even simple models like linear and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. The researchers introduced a new complexity measure called "length complexity" and analyzed its relationship with other notions of complexity. They also conducted experiments that demonstrated the non-trivial performance of these predictors on text generation and arithmetic tasks. The study suggests that the power of language models may be attributed to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, rather than a specific choice of architecture.

The discussion around the submission involves various perspectives on the power and implications of language models in solving complex tasks. Some commenters highlight the deterministic nature of linguistic determinism and its influence on thinking processes. Others point out that language skills do not necessarily equate to general intelligence and that there is a wide range of models and formalisms beyond Turing completeness that can approximate different types of thinking. 

There is also a conversation about the efficacy of language models in terms of practical applications, such as medical research and clinical note analysis. Some suggest that language models could be helpful in generating prompts for medical reports, while others caution that these models can encounter difficulties in generating coherent narratives.

There is interest in the concept of training models regressively and the challenges posed by difficult tasks, as well as the potential of intermediate steps in internal processing and the learning of step-by-step procedures. Some commenters express curiosity about the workings of language models and suggest that the focusing on regressive models in learning may enhance their performance.

One commenter provides a link to a related discussion on Hacker News with additional perspectives on the topic. Another commenter criticizes the practice of prompt engineering and suggests exploring alternative approaches.

## AI Submissions for Fri Sep 22 2023 {{ 'date': '2023-09-22T17:09:23.061Z' }}

### I made a transformer to predict a simple sequence manually

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/handmade-transformer/) | 329 points | by [lukastyrychtr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lukastyrychtr) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37609393)

In a blog post on September 11, 2023, the author shares their experience of building a transformer from scratch without training it. They wanted to gain a deeper understanding of transformers and attention, so they decided to manually assign each weight for a decoder-only transformer inspired by GPT-2.

The author starts by picking a task that is not too easy but also not too challenging. They settle on predicting a sequence of "aabaabaabaab...," which requires querying the previous two tokens to determine the next token. To simplify the problem, they use a tokenization scheme where "a" is represented by 0 and "b" by 1.

Next, the author designs the model based on jaymody's picoGPT implementation of GPT-2. They define functions for softmax, linear transformations, and attention calculations. The attention function takes in query (q), key (k), and value (v) matrices, and a mask, and returns the attention weights. The causal_self_attention function applies causal masking to hide future inputs and performs the attention calculation. The transformer_block function is then used to add the output of the attention calculation to the input.

Finally, the author mentions that they have implemented the necessary functions up to this point and will continue explaining the remaining parts in the next blog post.

This hands-on approach to building a transformer without relying on pretrained weights or training provides the author with a better understanding of transformers and attention. It also serves as a valuable resource for readers interested in delving into the inner workings of transformers.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of the blog post that describes building a transformer from scratch without training it. Here are some notable points from the discussion:

- One user shares a link to a blog post about Thinking Transformers, which explores using a primitive programming language called RASP to simulate the components of a transformer model.
- Others express interest in the hands-on approach and recommend following the work demonstrated by the author.
- One user notes that they initially struggled to understand transformers when they implemented them from scratch without pretraining. Their experience was different from the standard PyTorch transformer implementation, and they realized that training and backpropagation were not as straightforward as expected.
- Another user shares a link to a video by Andrej Karpathy discussing building a Neural Network from scratch, which they find relevant to the topic.
- The challenge of working with weights in models and the interpretability of specific clusters of neurons are discussed.
- The discussion delves into the idea of compressing machine learning models and the potential for more efficient and controllable interfaces.
- Some users highlight the difficulty of manually adjusting weights and the downstream effects of modifying weights in transformers.
- The attention mechanisms present in transformers are discussed, and it is noted that they do not necessarily represent semantics understandable to humans.
- The complexity and interpretability of weights in transformers are compared to the Traveling Salesman Problem, and the limitations of solving certain problems with transformers are mentioned.
- One user points out that neural networks are Turing machines and that the weights represent approximations of the computation process.

Overall, the discussion appreciates the hands-on approach of building a transformer from scratch and dives into various technical aspects and implications of the topic.

### Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller models

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/09/distilling-step-by-step-outperforming.html) | 309 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37606352)

A team of researchers from Google's Cloud AI team has developed a new mechanism called "distilling step-by-step" that allows smaller task-specific models to outperform larger language models (LLMs) with less training data. LLMs, such as BERT and T5, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing but tend to be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. The researchers found that by extracting informative natural language rationales from LLMs, they could train smaller models more efficiently. These rationales, which explain the connections between input questions and their corresponding outputs, provide additional supervision during training. The team demonstrated that a 770M parameter T5 model could outperform a 540B parameter PaLM model using only 80% of the examples in a benchmark dataset. This approach offers a potential solution for deploying high-performance natural language models in applications with limited computational resources.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the use of smaller task-specific models versus larger language models (LLMs) in natural language processing. Some users argue that using multiple smaller models instead of a single large model can be more effective in certain applications. Others point out the potential limitations of this approach and discuss different techniques for training smaller models. Some users also share related papers and resources on the subject. There is a debate about the effectiveness of curriculum training and the need for comprehensive training data for LLMs. The discussion also touches on the relevance of text generation and the importance of high-quality training data. Finally, there are conversations regarding the similarities and differences between LLMs and human intelligence, as well as the need for specialized resources like textbooks in natural language processing.

### AI-focused tech firms locked in ‘race to the bottom’, warns MIT professor

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/21/ai-focused-tech-firms-locked-race-bottom-warns-mit-professor-max-tegmark) | 12 points | by [pg_1234](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pg_1234) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37618807)

MIT physicist Max Tegmark has warned that AI-focused tech firms are engaged in a "race to the bottom" and are unwilling to pause development to consider the risks associated with artificial intelligence. Tegmark co-authored an open letter in March calling for a six-month pause in the development of advanced AI systems. The letter failed to secure a pause, but Tegmark believes it has had a significant impact in raising awareness about AI risks. He highlighted the growing interest from politicians and the convening of a global summit on AI safety by the UK government in November as evidence of the changes in attitude. Tegmark stressed the need for safety standards and government intervention in AI development.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the risks associated with the development of advanced AI systems.  One commenter argues that if civilization had control over its own development, it wouldn't surrender that control to AI. The problem, they believe, lies in people's reliance on AI technology, which is gradually replacing human tasks on a large scale. This commenter suggests that AI is being managed by a single entity rather than being collectively controlled, which raises concerns about individual influence over society. Another commenter argues that people are not trying to stop the development of AI; instead, they are attempting to regulate and ensure responsible advancements. However, a third commenter disagrees with this point, asserting that it is challenging to regulate AI since it has the potential to interfere with the ability to control civilization itself. Ultimately, the discussion highlights differing opinions on the extent to which AI development should be controlled and regulated.
