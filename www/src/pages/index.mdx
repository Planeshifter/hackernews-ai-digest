### Classifying customer messages with LLMs vs traditional ML

#### [Submission URL](https://www.trygloo.com/blog/classify-text-llms-learnings) | 248 points | by [hellovai](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hellovai) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36681839)

A recent post on Hacker News shared five key learnings from classifying 500k customer messages using Language Models (LLMs) compared to traditional Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The first learning emphasized that LLMs tend to prefer generating some output rather than none, leading to false-positives. To address this, the authors added a catch-all class like "other" to account for this tendency. 

The second learning highlighted the usefulness of tracking hallucinations, which are instances where the LLMs generate labels that are not present in the prompt. By analyzing these hallucinations, the authors found that simple and direct class names improved accuracy. They noted ongoing research regarding replacing class names with symbols to avoid bias towards using the class names themselves. The third learning emphasized the cost and latency advantages of using fine-tuned classification models in combination with LLMs. In one instance, a customer required lower-latency processing, so the authors trained Sentence-BERT (SBERT) using ChatGPT-labeled data. This approach achieved 85% parity with ChatGPT and over 90% accuracy on a subset of classes.

The fourth learning described "prompt engineering" as a well-known technique to enhance accuracy in text classification. By prompting the LLM to extract relevant clues before classification, state-of-the-art accuracy (96%+) can be achieved. The fifth learning stressed the importance of standardizing input for both fine-tuned models and LLMs. Longer text inputs can lead to less accurate predictions. To address this, the authors applied a preprocessing step to paraphrase the last user message with the previous context, particularly for multi-context chat messages, emails, long documents, and non-English messages.

The discussion on the Hacker News post includes various points and perspectives on the topic of using Language Models (LLMs) for text classification. Here are the key points that were discussed:

- Some users mentioned the use of keyword-based approaches or TF-IDF vectors for text classification, pointing out that the technique described in the post seemed to be categorizing and extracting semantic meaning from the text.
- Others noted that LLMs can be slower than traditional machine learning models and can be resource-intensive, especially when trained on large datasets.
- The topic of sentence embeddings and text embeddings was brought up, with some users expressing difficulty in understanding the underlying mathematics and concepts.
- A comparison was made between LLMs and attention algorithms, noting that they both have similar mechanisms.
- The relevance of the discussion to zero-shot learning was mentioned, with some users pointing out that although the technique described in the post is related, it is not exactly the same as zero-shot learning.
- The potential applications of LLMs in various domains and their ability to create novel solutions were discussed.
- Some users expressed skepticism and questioned the accuracy and reliability of LLMs for text classification tasks.

Overall, the discussion provided a mix of opinions and insights into the topic, with users sharing their experiences and raising interesting points for further exploration.

In a study conducted by researchers at EPFL in Switzerland, it has been found that nearly half of the workers on Amazon's Mechanical Turk platform may be utilizing AI to complete tasks that were intended for humans. Mechanical Turk allows users to divide small tasks into subtasks, paying workers a small amount of money for each completed task. These tasks often involve activities that are difficult to automate, such as CAPTCHA solving or sentiment analysis. However, the study reveals that workers are using large language models like ChatGPT to automate their work. This raises concerns about the reliability of the data collected through Mechanical Turk and highlights the growing issue of "AI training on AI-generated data." As language models continue to advance, it becomes harder to determine whether a task was actually completed by a human or AI. The researchers suggest that new measures need to be taken to ensure the integrity of human-generated data amidst this development.
