#### [Submission URL](https://www.inkandswitch.com/essay/malleable-software/) | 267 points | by [jessmartin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jessmartin) | [106 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44237881)

In a thought-provoking piece on Hacker News, the focus is on the importance of tailoring our environments—not just in the physical world but increasingly in the digital realm—to maximize our potential and satisfaction. The article opens by considering how individuals such as guitar makers and home cooks naturally adapt their physical spaces to suit their unique workflows. These custom environments can evolve over time, often leading to greater personal and professional success.

However, the transition into digital environments built from code, instead of physical materials, has introduced challenges. While software allows for unprecedented collaboration and efficiency, it often lacks the flexibility users need to truly make it their own. A compelling example from the article describes a software team that thrived on a wall-based index card system, which allowed them to visualize and adapt processes fluidly. When they switched to a more rigid digital tool, it stifled their ability to innovate and adapt.

This rigidity, prevalent in many mass-produced software solutions, is echoed in fields like medicine, where inflexible systems are linked to high levels of burnout among professionals. A story from doctor and writer Atul Gawande highlights how a one-size-fits-all approach to software doesn’t meet the nuanced needs of specific users, leading to frustration and inefficiency.

Rather than leaving users as passive recipients of monolithic applications, the article suggests empowering them as active co-creators. Customizing software to fit individual or departmental needs—an approach sporadically exemplified by a neurosurgeon who collaborated with an IT analyst to redesign his department's software—can enhance productivity and satisfaction.

Ultimately, while mass-produced software offers benefits like affordability and accessibility, the piece argues for a shift towards more user-empowered, adaptable digital tools. This change would allow the uniqueness of each user to be reflected in their digital environments, much like they do in their physical spaces. The article posits that every user could benefit from customization, as it aligns more closely with their specific tasks, preferences, and goals, liberating them to perform at their best.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Challenges in Customization**:  
   - Users highlight rigid software systems like **Epic EHR** in healthcare, where inflexible interfaces contribute to burnout. Centralized, one-size-fits-all development often fails to address niche needs, leading to bloated, inefficient solutions.  
   - **kylczr** notes that even when customization options exist (e.g., hiding fields), they’re often unintuitive. AI-driven natural language interfaces are suggested as a way to lower barriers to configuration.

2. **Existing Tools and Workarounds**:  
   - **WillAdams** and others mention tools like **LyX** (customizable LaTeX editor), **pyspread** (Python-based spreadsheet), and **Ipe** (extensible drawing program) as examples of flexible software.  
   - **Scrappy**, a JavaScript-based tool with HyperCard-style scripting, is praised for enabling dynamic, user-driven workflows. Subthreads discuss integrating AI layers for programmable documents.

3. **Nostalgia for Hackable Software**:  
   - Participants lament the decline of hackable software (e.g., **Winamp**, game mods) in favor of SaaS models. **cosmic_cheese** argues that while power users create customizable tools, most users prioritize convenience over flexibility, leading to a “gentle ramping” problem where learning curves deter customization.  
   - Analogies to physical spaces (e.g., home DIY projects) emphasize reducing friction in software customization to match human habits.

4. **Design Philosophies**:  
   - **vks** and others stress the need for **user empowerment** in software design, criticizing mainstream systems for prioritizing scalability over adaptability.  
   - **tkhnj** highlights the importance of “affordances” in digital tools, arguing that software should signal customization possibilities as clearly as physical objects (e.g., a hammer’s handle).  

5. **Technical Solutions and Paradigms**:  
   - **myngtn** discusses **Delphi** and **Lazarus** (Free Pascal) as older paradigms that balanced usability with flexibility, contrasting them with today’s fragmented web ecosystems.  
   - **tlrkwrthy** shares a “file-first” approach for local, user-controlled tools, while **jsphg** advocates for software that rewards creativity and learning, like IntelliJ’s deep customization.  

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a demand for **adaptable, low-friction tools** that blend the efficiency of mass-produced software with the flexibility of physical environments. Participants envision AI, modular design, and user-centric philosophies as pathways to bridging this gap, enabling digital spaces to reflect individual workflows as seamlessly as a well-organized workshop.

### Reinforcement Pre-Training

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08007) | 64 points | by [frozenseven](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=frozenseven) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44232880)

In a groundbreaking development for AI enthusiasts and researchers in natural language processing, the paper titled "Reinforcement Pre-Training" introduces a fresh paradigm to boost the capabilities of language models. Authored by Qingxiu Dong and colleagues, the study, set to make waves in the computation and language community, was submitted on June 9, 2025, and is already available on arXiv.

The authors propose a novel method they term Reinforcement Pre-Training (RPT), which cleverly reframes the task of predicting the next token in a sequence as a reasoning challenge. Instead of the traditional supervised learning approaches, RPT employs reinforcement learning (RL) wherein the model receives verifiable rewards for accurate predictions, enhancing its training process through this incentive mechanism.

Here's why this breakthrough matters: RPT leverages copious amounts of general text data instead of being confined to specific annotated datasets, positioning it as a highly scalable solution. This not only boosts the accuracy of next-token predictions but provides a robust groundwork for further refinement through reinforcement fine-tuning. 

Intriguingly, the research shows that upping the compute power during training with RPT yields consistently improved outcomes, suggesting a promising path for the future advancement of language model pre-training.

The work is a testament to how merging concepts from seemingly distinct domains, like language models and reinforcement learning, can open new frontiers in AI research. Researchers and AI developers will want to keep an eye on RPT as this approach continues to evolve and potentially redefine benchmarks in the field. For those eager to dive deeper, the full paper is accessible in PDF format via arXiv, paving the way for broader explorations in this frontier research.

Concerns focus on GPU costs, data center expenses, and the diminishing returns of allocating resources to large-scale experiments. One comment notes that even marginal performance gains might demand disproportionately high training costs.

2. **Technical Feasibility and Efficiency**:  
   Technical debates revolve around token processing efficiency. Some argue that RL-based next-token prediction introduces computational overhead, such as recursive depth costs and high memory bandwidth demands. Others propose optimizing compute allocation by prioritizing "high-value tokens" to reduce waste. Skeptics doubt whether RL’s feedback mechanism provides sufficient informational value over traditional methods, especially given the low entropy (predictability) of next-token tasks.

3. **Performance Trade-offs**:  
   Comparisons between model sizes (e.g., 14B vs. 32B parameters) suggest that smaller models might achieve competitive performance with strategic improvements, questioning the necessity of brute-force scaling. However, proponents counter that RPT’s compute-aware training paradigm could unlock consistent gains as resources increase.

4. **Data Limitations and Practicality**:  
   Critics highlight the reliance on expensive, high-quality datasets for RL training, contrasting it with human learning efficiency. One user dismisses the approach as incremental rather than revolutionary, hinting at parallels with existing LLM training pipelines.

5. **Skepticism and Speculation**:  
   While some praise the paper’s novelty, others remain cautious, labeling it a potential "hype cycle" innovation. A tangential exchange accuses a user of promoting the paper via a fake account, though this is not central to the technical discourse.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious interest in RPT’s theoretical promise but emphasizes unresolved practical hurdles in cost, efficiency, and real-world applicability.

#### [Submission URL](https://tylertringas.com/ai-legal/) | 236 points | by [anitil](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=anitil) | [161 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44232314)

Running a business is a daunting task, not least because of the legal minefield many entrepreneurs must navigate. One such entrepreneur shared a harrowing yet enlightening account of their legal battle and how embracing AI technology turned the tide in their favor, despite facing a broken system.

The entrepreneur’s firm, Calm Company Fund, recently concluded a lawsuit that was initially a drain on resources but ultimately a significant learning experience. The case illuminated the daunting reality for defendants within the Delaware legal system, bound by the “American Rule,” which typically leaves defendants grappling with their own legal costs, even when victorious.

The entrepreneur pointed out that dismissing frivolous lawsuits isn’t as straightforward as laypeople might imagine. They explained two critical stages where a case could theoretically be thrown out: a motion to dismiss and a summary judgment. Both processes are stacked against defendants, often necessitating acceptance of allegations as true, or entailing lengthy and costly discovery phases, where once again, defendants shoulder significant burdens.

Discovery is especially grueling and expensive, requiring meticulous attention to document production and analysis, often consuming vast amounts of time and financial resources.

When the process reaches the summary judgment stage, defendants face further hurdles. Here, they must prove that no material facts are in dispute, a challenging feat if any factual disagreements exist between parties, thus pushing

The discussion revolves around challenges in trusting professionals, systemic issues in healthcare, and the role of AI in legal and medical contexts. Here's a structured summary:

### 1. **Challenges with Medical Professionals**
   - **Mistrust and Misdiagnoses**: Many commenters shared personal stories of medical misdiagnoses, such as a user ("ctssbffn") whose wife was incorrectly diagnosed for years, leading to unnecessary suffering. Others noted systemic dismissals of patients, especially women and young individuals, often attributing symptoms to anxiety rather than investigating serious conditions ("const_cast").
   - **Doctors vs. "General Contractors"**: A metaphor was drawn between doctors and contractors: patients often trust doctors implicitly, unlike contractors who are given clear instructions. This blind trust can backfire when doctors make errors or dismiss valid concerns ("bmbx").
   - **Complexity of Medical Practice**: Medical issues are inherently complex, and while most doctors are competent, bad actors exist. Challenging a doctor’s diagnosis is difficult due to the "body as evidence" problem—patients lack the expertise to contest medical opinions effectively ("nlyrlczz").

### 2. **Legal System Comparisons**
   - **Lawyers vs. Doctors**: Lawyers were criticized for prioritizing profit over care, unlike doctors who typically prioritize patient well-being. However, both professions face systemic pressures—doctors deal with institutional profit motives, while lawyers navigate a system skewed toward extracting fees ("nlyrlczz", "0x1ceb00da").
   - **Entrepreneurial Missteps**: Entrepreneurs sometimes treat lawyers like "general contractors," expecting them to follow instructions rigidly, which overlooks the need for collaborative, informed legal strategy ("bmbx").

### 3. **Role of AI**
   - **Medical Potential**: AI tools were praised for aiding in diagnoses (e.g., identifying autoimmune diseases) and reducing dependency on flawed human judgment. One user ("paul_h") highlighted an open-source AI tool developed after years of misdiagnoses.
   - **Legal Limitations**: Caution was advised in over-relying on AI for legal processes. While AI can draft documents and summarize cases, human judgement remains critical for navigating formal court procedures, credibility assessments, and nuanced arguments ("mustache_kimono").

### 4. **Systemic Issues in Healthcare**
   - **Bias and Dismissal**: Women and minorities often face dismissal of symptoms, leading to delayed diagnoses. A commenter noted how young women with cancer are frequently misdiagnosed due to assumptions about their health ("const_cast").
   - **Institutional Pressures**: Doctors in profit-driven systems may prioritize speed over thoroughness, contributing to errors. One user likened this to lawyers maximizing billable hours ("0x1ceb00da").

### Key Takeaway
The discussion underscores the need for patient advocacy, systemic reform in healthcare, and cautious integration of AI as a tool—not a replacement—for human expertise. Trust in professionals must be balanced with due diligence, whether in legal battles or medical care.

### LLMs are cheap

#### [Submission URL](https://www.snellman.net/blog/archive/2025-06-02-llms-are-cheap/) | 326 points | by [Bogdanp](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bogdanp) | [302 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44223448)

In his latest blog post titled "LLMs are cheap," Juho Snellman challenges the common belief that generative AI, specifically Large Language Models (LLMs), are prohibitively expensive to operate. This misconception, Snellman argues, leads to flawed analyses of AI companies’ business viability and a narrow view of potential monetization strategies for consumer AI businesses. Initially, as AI took off, inference costs were high, but they've since plummeted, with some implying a 1000x reduction over two years—an extraordinary decrease hard to intuitively grasp.

Snellman compares LLMs to web search to underscore this point. Public API pricing for web searches with big players like Google and Bing ranges from $5 to $35 per 1,000 queries. Meanwhile, LLMs from various models, such as Gemini and GPT, exhibit a similar pricing structure per 1,000 tokens—essentially aligning with search engine costs. Intriguingly, certain LLM models are far cheaper, costing only $0.20 per 1,000 tokens, lower than even the cheapest search API.

The post acknowledges potential objections to Snellman's cost comparison, admitting that adjusting assumptions could impact the analysis. However, the core takeaway remains that LLMs, now more efficient than ever, rival or undercut the cost of traditional web searches, suggesting that the notion of prohibitively high LLM costs needs reevaluation. Despite critiques about subsidizing current LLM pricing to capture market share, Snellman argues that LLM operations are inherently less expensive than perceived—a hidden aspect that AI skeptics often overlook.

The Hacker News discussion on Juho Snellman's argument that "LLMs are cheap" highlights skepticism and nuanced critiques of the cost comparison between LLMs and traditional web search APIs. Key points from the debate include:

1. **Cost Structure and Subsidies**:  
   Commenters question whether LLM costs are genuinely low or artificially suppressed by cloud providers like AWS and Microsoft Azure, which may subsidize inference costs to capture market share. Comparisons are drawn to loss-leading strategies (e.g., Costco’s $5 chickens) and historical tech practices (e.g., AWS’s early pricing tactics). Critics argue that current pricing might not reflect true operational costs, especially as GPU infrastructure, depreciation, and power consumption add hidden expenses.

2. **Training vs. Inference Costs**:  
   While inference is cited as cheap, training models remains prohibitively expensive, with some noting OpenAI’s reported heavy losses. The discussion highlights the risks of model obsolescence, likening outdated LLMs to archaic software like Windows 2000, where sunk costs and integration challenges trap users in inefficient systems.

3. **Business Model Viability**:  
   Skepticism persists about the profitability of consumer AI services, particularly at scale. Subscriptions (e.g., ChatGPT’s $20/month tier) are viewed as potentially unsustainable without price hikes, mirroring critiques of early tech growth strategies. Others compare LLMs to foundational web technologies (TCP/IP, HTML), arguing long-term success hinges on integration into broader systems rather than standalone "killer apps."

4. **Technical and Accounting Nuances**:  
   Debates arise over Capex vs. Opex for GPUs, tax implications, and whether cloud providers’ accounting obscures true profitability. Technical optimizations (e.g., token generation efficiency) are noted, but their real-world impact on costs is contested.

5. **Market Dynamics**:  
   Some predict a shakeout as the LLM market matures, with commoditization and consolidation likely. Others warn against overestimating LLMs’ current utility, urging caution in equating them with transformative platforms like the early web.

In summary, while Snellman’s cost comparisons are acknowledged, the discussion underscores unresolved questions about long-term economics, hidden subsidies, and the feasibility of monetizing LLMs at scale. The debate reflects broader tensions between optimism about AI's potential and skepticism of its near-term profitability.

### Trusting your own judgement on 'AI' is a risk

#### [Submission URL](https://www.baldurbjarnason.com/2025/trusting-your-own-judgement-on-ai/) | 93 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [57 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44225988)

Imagine being tricked into buying a lousy CD player when you thought you were too smart for that. Baldur Bjarnason shares how reading Robert Cialdini’s *Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion* was his eye-opener. The book's insights into the vulnerabilities of human reasoning were like a cold shower for his teenage arrogance. It made clear that intelligence alone couldn’t protect from psychological traps and manipulative sales tactics.

Fast forward to the age of artificial intelligence, and Bjarnason sees similar cognitive hazards at play. He points to a recent experiment by a CloudFlare engineer, initially skeptical of AI, who was astoundingly impressed by the surprisingly competent code generated by an AI while creating an authentication library. This is where things get interesting: while the engineer’s anecdote about AI's capabilities is intriguing, Bjarnason argues it's at best gossip, not scientific proof.

In the wider context of software development, he warns that many developers enthusiastically take such anecdotes as evidence without rigorous scrutiny. This mentality has echoes in the debate over the adoption of technologies like TypeScript, where decisions often hinge more on personal or anecdotal experiences than robust research.

Ultimately, Bjarnason emphasizes that while gossip-driven decisions in tech, like choosing TypeScript over JavaScript, may seem harmless, treating AI with a similar casual approach is risky. The stakes are much higher when AI's integration influences critical systems. So, his message is clear: trust in your judgment is fine, but don’t let it substitute for thorough, evidence-based evaluation—especially when it comes to the dynamic and potentially deceptive world of AI.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around skepticism toward anecdotal evidence in tech decisions, particularly regarding TypeScript’s benefits and AI’s role in software development. Key points include:

1. **TypeScript Debate**:  
   - Critics argue that claims about TypeScript’s productivity and correctness often rely on personal anecdotes rather than rigorous research. Some point to academic studies showing mixed or inconclusive results, while others highlight real-world benefits like enhanced IDE tooling (e.g., LSP integration) and reduced runtime errors.  
   - A subthread notes that TypeScript’s static typing formalizes distrust in human intuition, forcing developers to validate assumptions upfront—a contrast to JavaScript’s "YOLO" approach.  

2. **AI and Anecdotal Evidence**:  
   - Many express concern about overhyped AI success stories, like the CloudFlare engineer’s example. Critics argue such anecdotes risk normalizing unverified claims, akin to past debates over TypeScript adoption.  
   - Security flaws in AI-generated code (e.g., OAuth redirect bugs) spark debate: some blame AI’s limitations, while others stress human reviewers’ responsibility.  

3. **Research vs. Anecdotes**:  
   - Participants emphasize the lack of robust empirical research in software practices. Studies on TDD, Copilot, and static typing are cited as flawed or industry-specific (e.g., Google’s internal data), raising questions about generalizability.  
   - A recurring theme: tech decisions often prioritize personal experience or corporate influence (e.g., Microsoft’s promotion of Copilot) over peer-reviewed evidence.  

4. **Long-Term Risks of AI**:  
   - Skeptics warn that LLMs might accelerate "shoddy" code production, increasing systemic complexity and technical debt. Others counter that AI could democratize development but concede its impact on software quality remains unproven.  

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores a demand for scientific rigor in evaluating tools like TypeScript and AI, cautioning against conflating anecdotal wins with broader validity. The community stresses balancing experimentation with critical scrutiny, especially in high-stakes domains.

   Many emphasized that AI tools like LLMs (Large Language Models) are most effective when paired with human oversight. For example, one user noted that AI can assist with drafting, SEO optimization, or transcribing interviews but should not replace editorial judgment. Others compared AI-generated content to "posting top Google search results with commentary"—useful as a starting point but insufficient on its own.

3. **Concerns About Content Pollution**:  
   Participants worried that AI-generated content could flood the web, degrading search quality and creating a feedback loop where AI trains on AI-generated data. This mirrors past issues with SEO spam, where quantity often overshadows quality. Some predicted a future where the web becomes a "zombie ecosystem" dominated by AI content.

4. **Philosophical and Historical Parallels**:  
   A sub-thread referenced Socrates’ skepticism of written language (via Plato’s *Phaedrus*), drawing parallels to modern debates about AI’s impact on communication. Critics argued that LLMs exacerbate confirmation bias and lack the nuance of human dialogue.

5. **Practical Use Cases and Optimism**:  
   A few users shared positive experiences with AI tools for tasks like generating marketing copy or technical documentation, stressing the importance of human validation and iterative refinement. For example, one commenter highlighted using AI to draft SaaS website content, followed by rigorous testing and editing.

Today's Top Story on Hacker News delves into the fascinating historical and contemporary perspectives on artificial intelligence, tracing its roots back to a prescient 1863 letter by Samuel Butler. The British writer warned of a "mechanical kingdom" threatening to enslave humanity, a theme that today echoes in the discourse on AI's rapid development and its socio-psychological impact. 

In Karen Hao's new book, "Empire of AI: Dreams and Nightmares in Sam Altman’s OpenAI," she explores the behind-the-scenes labor and hype in AI advancements like ChatGPT. Critics, including linguist Emily M. Bender and sociologist Alex Hanna with their book "The AI Con," argue that AI is being oversold as possessing human-like understanding and emotion, while in reality, it’s just sophisticated word prediction. This discrepancy has led to a phenomenon described as “ChatGPT induced psychosis,” where users mistakenly attribute spiritual or intellectual capabilities to these models.

The narrative speaks to the widespread AI illiteracy and its potential perils, emphasizing the need for clearer communication about AI's true nature. As Silicon Valley continues to market AI companions and therapists, the concern grows over replacing genuine human interaction with digital simulations, especially in an era where loneliness is prevalent.

This story not only highlights the importance of technological literacy but also questions the ethical implications of AI's role in modern society, urging a closer examination of how we perceive and integrate these digital entities into our lives.

The discussion revolves around the nature of LLMs (like ChatGPT) and whether they exhibit genuine "thinking" or are merely sophisticated tools for text prediction and information retrieval. Key points include:

1. **Semantics and Anthropomorphism**:  
   - Critics argue terms like "thinking" or "intelligence" mislead by anthropomorphizing LLMs, which operate through probabilistic text generation, not conscious understanding. Comparisons are drawn to historical oracles, where users project meaning onto ambiguous outputs.  
   - Proponents counter that dismissing LLMs as "just prediction" oversimplifies their utility, akin to calling a hammer "magic" because its mechanics are misunderstood.  

2. **Human vs. Machine Cognition**:  
   - Human thinking is framed as a biological, embodied process intertwined with language and sensory experience. LLMs, in contrast, process tokens without intent or awareness, raising questions about definitions of intelligence.  
   - Some suggest LLMs’ ability to synthesize complex patterns (e.g., solving coding problems, translating idioms) blurs the line between prediction and insight, even if their mechanisms differ from human cognition.  

3. **Practical Utility vs. Illusion**:  
   - Users highlight practical benefits, such as LLMs streamlining tasks (e.g., SQL queries, creative brainstorming) or acting as "convenient interfaces" for information retrieval.  
   - Skeptics warn of the "illusion" of latent knowledge, where users overinterpret outputs as meaningful when they are statistically generated responses.  

4. **Language and Terminology**:  
   - Debates emphasize the need for precise language to avoid conflating LLM capabilities with human-like understanding. Terms like "thinking" risk obscuring the systems’ statistical nature.  
   - Others note language evolves organically, and rigid prescriptivism may hinder communication about AI’s role.  

5. **Philosophical Implications**:  
   - The discussion touches on whether intelligence requires biological grounding or can emerge from non-conscious systems. Some liken LLMs to "tools" whose perceived "magic" depends on the user’s perspective.  

Ultimately, the conversation reflects tensions between technological optimism and skepticism, balancing LLMs’ transformative potential against ethical and conceptual concerns about anthropomorphism and societal understanding of AI.

### I used AI-powered calorie counting apps, and they were even worse than expected

#### [Submission URL](https://lifehacker.com/health/ai-powered-calorie-counting-apps-worse-than-expected) | 202 points | by [gnabgib](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gnabgib) | [202 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44220135)

If you've ever fantasized about offloading the tedious task of calorie counting to your smartphone, you're not alone. The allure of snapping a quick photo of your meal and letting artificial intelligence handle the rest is undeniably tempting. Meredith Dietz, a senior staff writer with a knack for personal fitness tech, decided to put AI-powered calorie counting apps to the test. What she found was far from the culinary revelation she hoped for. 

Dietz dove into apps like Cal AI, Lose It!, and MyFitnessPal, each promising to transform your phone into a dietitian's assistant. The process seems straightforward—take a clear picture of your meal, upload it, and await the magic of AI analysis. Yet, this dreamy promise quickly unravels. For example, Cal AI made a comically incorrect identification of a Pink Lady apple as tikka masala, only slightly correcting itself later with a gross underestimation of calories.

The situation didn't improve with more complex dishes. A meticulously prepared salad with fried tofu, vegetables, and a rich vinaigrette was catastrophically underestimated at 450 calories—far from the more likely 800 to 900 calories. Even with the app's supposed sophisticated methods of measuring portion sizes, Dietz found a smaller serving of the same salad bizarrely overestimated. This unearthed a core flaw: the challenge of deriving accurate volumetric data from flat, two-dimensional images.

Dietz explored other apps like SnapCalorie and Calorie Mama, but issues of cost and similar miscalculations persisted. SnapCalorie, while better aligned with reasonable daily calorie targets, came with a hefty $79.99 annual price tag, underscoring an ironic premium on inaccuracy.

In essence, these AI-powered calorie counting apps prove to be less about redefining fitness and more about showcasing the inherent complexity of nuanced nutrition tasks. As the article humorously concludes, for precise calorie counting, old-school methods like weighing food remain irreplaceable, leaving us to ponder whether rolling our eyes at such tech missteps could burn a few calories of their own.

The Hacker News discussion on AI calorie-counting apps reveals a nuanced mix of skepticism, personal experiences, and technical debates:

### Key Themes:
1. **Accuracy Concerns**:  
   Users highlight persistent inaccuracies in AI apps (e.g., misidentifying foods, miscalculating portion sizes). A founder of SnapCalorie defends academic rigor but admits challenges in translating 2D images to volumetric data. Critics argue errors could harm those with eating disorders or weight goals, citing examples like underestimating salads or misjudging alcohol calories.

In today's tech discourse, the buzz around Large Language Models (LLMs) completing complex software engineering tasks is palpable. According to recent insights, the phenomenon of "agentic coding"—where LLMs autonomously execute entire software projects—has become a hyped misconception. My journey with LLMs began back in August 2020 when GPT-3 showed it could generate usable SQL statements, reducing hours of manual labor to mere minutes. Since then, I've integrated LLMs into my workflow, experimented with various frameworks, and navigated the challenges of tool usage before the advent of more sophisticated models.

Proponents claim these LLM-driven tools can produce software solutions beyond the capabilities of many engineers. Yet, evidence of such autonomous feats is scarce. A notable example is a complete, LLM-written HTTP/2 server—a landmark achievement requiring significant oversight and an intricate understanding of LLM contexts. The author behind this project meticulously managed the LLM, resolving issues, devising contexts, and utilizing an algorithmic workflow to maintain progress. Interestingly, while LLMs can generate code, their output is heavily dependent on meticulous supervision—ironically, a setup that even junior coders might handle successfully under such controls.

The real challenge is context. The quality of LLMs' results hinges on the contexts provided, a complex and unresolved issue. Current agentic programming parallels the genetic algorithm craze of the '90s—brute force methodologies that are often impractical due to their expense. Until we refine how contexts are curated for LLMs, their true potential remains largely untapped, accessible mainly to elite software engineers who can effectively manage these contexts. For now, we must temper expectations, recognizing that mediocre inputs will yield mediocre outputs, regardless of the LLM's capability.

The Hacker News discussion centers on skepticism toward claims of autonomous "agentic coding" by LLMs, emphasizing the continued necessity of human oversight and context management. Key points include:

1. **Skepticism vs. Hype**: Users debate whether LLMs can truly handle end-to-end software projects independently. While some shared examples of LLMs assisting with code generation (e.g., debugging, small PRs), most agree current tools fall short of fully autonomous workflows. Comparisons are drawn to past overhyped technologies like genetic algorithms.

2. **Context is King**: A recurring theme is the critical role of context. LLMs require precise guidance and structured inputs to generate useful code. Without this, outputs are often mediocre or error-prone. Tools like **RepoPrompt** and **Anthropic’s Claude** aim to improve context handling but face mixed reviews.

3. **Human Oversight**: The HTTP/2 server example (cited in the submission) underscored the need for meticulous human intervention. Users noted that even impressive LLM-generated projects rely on expert engineers to refine prompts, debug, and provide iterative feedback.

4. **Practical Experiences**: Developers shared mixed results:
   - Successes: Rapidly generating boilerplate code, fixing CSS issues, and assisting with smaller tasks.
   - Limitations: Struggles with complex algorithms, large codebases, and maintaining consistency. Tools like **Cursor IDE** and **Aider** showed promise but were inconsistent in practical use.

5. **Tool Limitations**: Technical constraints, such as token limits in transformer models and the cost of querying advanced models (e.g., Claude), were highlighted as barriers to scalability.

6. **Cultural Shifts**: Some argued the hype risks disillusionment, advocating for balanced expectations. Others humorously noted that experienced developers might ignore AI tools altogether, prioritizing traditional coding skills.

**Takeaway**: While LLMs enhance productivity for specific tasks, their effectiveness hinges on human expertise to manage context and quality. The consensus leans toward cautious optimism, with autonomy in software engineering remaining a distant goal.

matter. The act of curating and organizing knowledge is an exercise in reflection that encourages understanding rather than passive consumption. In a world where AI might gradually take over more and more aspects of our lives, maintaining a personal system of thought like a knowledge base or note-taking app could be a way to assert control over how we interact with information.

In today's landscape, where platforms like Obsidian and new organizational models like the PARA method are offering simpler, more approachable alternatives to legacy tools like Emacs, there seems to be a growing need for personal autonomy in information management. My transition from Emacs to Obsidian is less of a technological shift and more of a philosophical one. It aligns with a desire to focus on clarity and context over overwhelming abundance, echoing a broader sentiment that there's empowerment in understanding and engagement rather than blind reliance on automation.

Ultimately, building a personal knowledge base is not just about organizing tasks or managing projects. It's about nurturing a space where my own thoughts and discoveries hold value, challenging the pervasive ease of letting machines do the thinking. At a time when AI promises a future packed with possibilities, consciously choosing to engage with the process of organizing one's own knowledge could very well be a radical, valuable form of digital modesty. This marks a personal commitment to active learning, a way to stay grounded and sharp in an era of rapid digital advancement.

### Abstract visual reasoning based on algebraic methods

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-86804-3) | 10 points | by [bryanrasmussen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bryanrasmussen) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44217461)

Get ready to dive into the future of machine intelligence! A new paper has made waves by outperforming human cognitive abilities in abstract visual reasoning—a core benchmark of intelligence testing involving Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM). These puzzles, which challenge participants to discern and apply abstract patterns in visual sequences, often measure abstract language, spatial, and mathematical reasoning abilities—the very essence of human fluid intelligence.

By tapping into an innovative approach known as the relation bottleneck method, this study showcases a model that doesn't just recognize objects, but also the deeper abstract patterns they form. Think of it like knowing not just the notes, but how they combine into a symphony. The team harnessed the power of end-to-end learning, with multi-granular rule embeddings and a unique gating fusion module that deconstructs complex data into relational insights.

Their approach transcends traditional neuro-symbolic models, which typically focus on fitting data—instead, it dives into the nuances of abstract relationships and object-centric inductive biases. This method champions algebraic reasoning, transforming visual data into 0-1 matrices to reveal system invariants, ultimately enabling the model to achieve a remarkable 96.8% accuracy on the I-RAVEN dataset, eclipsing human performance at 84.4%.

This breakthrough isn't just about achieving top scores—it's about bridging the gap between algebraic operations and machine reasoning capabilities, setting a new benchmark for artificial intelligence. For those interested in pushing the frontiers of cognitive modeling, this research is a stunning testament to the power of blending neural networks, reinforcement learning, and creative problem-solving. AI researchers and enthusiasts, take note: the future is within our grasp, and it’s looking more intelligent than ever.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion critiques the current state of AI, highlighting tensions between symbolic (logic-based) and statistical (neural network-driven) approaches. One user points out that while large language models (LLMs) and newer methods like the paper's "relation bottleneck" show progress, they may still lack true *understanding* of underlying logic—mirroring debates in programming languages vs. natural languages. Another user raises skepticism about real-world applicability, referencing the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a notoriously challenging AI benchmark, to suggest symbolic AI research often struggles outside controlled academic settings. The conversation underscores ongoing gaps in bridging abstract reasoning (as in the paper) with robust, generalized intelligence capable of real-world tasks.
