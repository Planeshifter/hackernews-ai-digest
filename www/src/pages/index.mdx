### After Authenticity (2018)

#### [Submission URL](https://subpixel.space/entries/after-authenticity/) | 36 points | by [antoviaque](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=antoviaque) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42772300)

In a thought-provoking entry for Subpixel Space, Toby Shorin explores the concept of "post-authenticity," tracing the evolution of our cultural fixation on authenticity, particularly among artists and creators. In the past, selling out—like Shepard Fairey transitioning his street art into a commercial skate brand—was viewed as a betrayal. Yet, over the past decade, this notion has largely dissipated. 

Shorin argues that authenticity has transformed from an ideal to a relic of an earlier cultural moment, suggesting that contemporary creators, inspired by high-profile figures like Kanye West, now embrace personal branding as an accepted norm rather than an ethical lapse. He details how the very concept of authenticity has roots in a disdain for commodification, revealing a tension within cultural production that has shifted significantly since the 2000s. 

The rise of the "hipsters" and their cultural language emphasized a quest for originality, often rejecting commercialized experiences as inauthentic. However, Shorin posits that this paradigm has evolved—merchandising, even for well-known artists, is now celebrated rather than vilified, signaling a substantial change in cultural values over the last twenty years.

Amid this cultural shift, Shorin invites readers to reconsider what authenticity truly means in an age where personal branding is heralded as an achievement, effectively marking a departure from the once prevalent skepticism of commodification and the search for the "genuine" in creative expression.
