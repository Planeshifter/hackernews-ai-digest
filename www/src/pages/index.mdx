Another impressive feature of PlayHT2.0 is its instant voice cloning capabilities. With just a few seconds of audio, the model can replicate voices with stunning accuracy and resemblance, without the need for extensive finetuning. Additionally, due to the large and diverse dataset on which the model was trained, it can clone and generate voices in almost any language or accent. Users can even make a cloned voice speak a different language while preserving the original accent.

PlayHT2.0 also introduces the ability to direct emotions in generated speech. While this feature is still in its early stages and expected to improve with more training, the model can already understand and apply basic emotions in real-time. Users can prompt the model with emotions like happiness, sadness, fear, or disgust, and it will generate speech with the corresponding emotion. This opens up the possibility of defining custom emotions on the fly, further expanding the capabilities of the model.

Overall, PlayHT2.0 represents a significant advancement in Generative Voice AI, providing enhanced conversational abilities, faster speech generation, instant voice cloning, and the ability to direct emotions in generated speech.

In the latest episode of the CoRecursive podcast, host Adam Gordon Bell tells the fascinating story of Ron Garret's experience trying to bring LISP programming into the world of space exploration. In 1988, Ron was working on the prototype for the first Mars Rover at the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). The goal was to develop software that would allow NASA to send an autonomous rover to Mars. However, using LISP, a programming language known for its use of parentheses and treating code as data, was not the norm at NASA.

Operating a rover on Mars presented several challenges, including a 40-minute round-trip light time delay. This meant that remote operation of the rover was not feasible, and autonomy was crucial. Ron and his team wanted to push the boundaries of autonomy to enable the rover to accomplish more within each command cycle.

While Ron's office at JPL was fairly standard, he had access to an electronic shop and occasionally took the robots outdoors for testing. The robots included FANG, a large rover the size of half a refrigerator, Tooth, a shoebox-sized robot, and Robbie, a six-wheeled rover the size of an SUV. These prototypes eventually led to the development of the Sojourner rover, which landed on Mars in 1997.

Ron's team chose to use LISP for their software development, but it was not a common choice at NASA. As a result, they faced skepticism from colleagues and project managers who favored more traditional programming languages. Despite the challenges, Ron and his team continued to develop the software using LISP.

Their work eventually caught the attention of NASA's New Millennium Program, which aimed to develop new technologies for space exploration. This led to the Deep Space 1 mission, which included the Remote Agent, an autonomous onboard software developed with LISP. The mission encountered project management difficulties, but the Remote Agent performed admirably.

One notable challenge Ron faced was debugging code in space. Since the Rover had limited computational power and storage, traditional debugging techniques were not feasible. Ron solved this problem by developing a system for sending S-expressions remotely, allowing him to analyze and fix code on the Rover.

Overall, Ron's experience raises the question of whether using LISP was worth the effort. While it may not have been the most popular choice at NASA, the unique capabilities of LISP offered new possibilities for autonomous software development in space exploration.

#### [Submission URL](https://mkone.ai/blog/introducing-mk1) | 279 points | by [ejz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ejz) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37016413)

MK-1 is a new startup that aims to provide companies with the same efficient language model capabilities as elite AI powerhouses like OpenAI and Google. Their first product, MKML, is an inference runtime that can significantly reduce the costs and improve the performance of large language models on GPUs.

One of the main challenges that MKML addresses is the large memory footprint of these models, which can limit performance and increase costs. MKML has developed a compression technique that can reduce the size of models by about 60%, while maintaining a high fidelity to the original model. For example, a Llama-2 13B model that initially requires 26GB of memory can be shrunk down to just 10.5GB with MKML.

The benefits of using MKML are twofold. Firstly, it allows companies to use lower-cost GPU instances that have less memory capacity, without sacrificing performance. For example, the compressed Llama-2 13B model can now fit on a single A10 24GB instance, which is about 45% less expensive than the A100 instance. Secondly, for companies that can afford the more powerful A100 instance, MKML can increase performance by up to 2.0x compared to the baseline model.

MKML is designed to be easy to integrate into existing workflows and works seamlessly with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch. With just a few lines of Python code, developers can compress their models and use MKML for inference.

The performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, and the results consistently show that it outperforms the baseline model in terms of token generation speed. Additionally, the compressed models maintain a high level of fidelity, with only a small difference in perplexity compared to the original models.

MK-1 is currently in closed beta release, but if you're interested in becoming an early partner and gaining access to new features, you can contact them for more information. With MKML, companies can optimize their inference stack, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of their language models.

The discussion around the submission on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of MKML and its comparison to existing methods.

One commenter points out that quantization methods that are already available usually provide comparable results to what MKML is claiming. They mention that these techniques have already been widely used and question the novelty of MKML's approach.

The founder of MK-1, Paul Merolla, responds to address the comments. He explains that MKML is designed to be a targeted solution that focuses on compressing models with high performance and efficiency. He highlights that MKML builds on the existing framework of Hugging Face and other popular ecosystems. He also mentions that the performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, consistently outperforming the baseline models.

Another commenter raises a question about the integration of MKML and the existing frameworks like Hugging Face. Paul Merolla responds and clarifies that MKML is not simply repackaging existing frameworks, but rather integrating its own compression scheme. He emphasizes that MKML targets multi-task, multi-prompt batch=1 use cases and achieves faster token generation speed compared to other methods.

The discussion further delves into specific technical questions about memory footprint, batch sizes, and model performance. Paul Merolla provides detailed answers and also mentions that MK-1 is working on wrapping their techniques and tools into open-source software.

There are also discussions about other quantization techniques, such as 4-bit and 8-bit quantization, and their potential application to speed up model inference.

Overall, the discussion is a mix of skepticism, technical questions, and comparisons to existing methods.

The latest version of OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, has been causing some confusion due to its non-deterministic behavior. Even when set to a temperature of 0.0, which should result in deterministic output, GPT-4 still produces different results. This has raised questions about why this behavior persists, especially since it was reported over three years ago.

A recent paper on Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models may provide some insights. In the paper, it was mentioned that MoE models, like GPT-4, can become non-deterministic at the sequence level when tokens from different sequences compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. This suggests that the non-determinism in GPT-4 could be attributed to its Sparse MoE architecture.

To test this hypothesis, the author decided to ask GPT-4 itself by writing a script that generates multiple completions using different models. The results of the experiment confirmed that GPT-4's non-determinism is consistent across models, providing further evidence for the impact of its Sparse MoE architecture.

While the exact cause of the non-determinism is still not fully understood, this research offers valuable insights into the behavior of GPT-4 and highlights the challenges in achieving full determinism in complex language models.

### Why This AI Moment May Be the Real Deal

#### [Submission URL](https://www.thenewatlantis.com/publications/why-this-ai-moment-may-be-the-real-deal) | 140 points | by [_delirium](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=_delirium) | [218 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36951809)

For years, the tech world has been skeptical of the promises made by artificial intelligence (AI). Despite impressive achievements and the creation of valuable wealth, AI often seemed limited, relying on human intervention behind the scenes. However, a new AI moment has arrived, and it may just be the real deal.

In this essay, the author explores the features of the new transformer paradigm and why it defies past skepticism. The essay begins with a reference to Joseph Weizenbaum, the pioneer of AI who warned about the public's susceptibility to believing that AI systems possess intelligence, even when they don't. This phenomenon, known as the man-behind-the-curtain effect, raises questions about the true capabilities of AI.

The author then reflects on their experience as a computer science student, where the potential of AI seemed tantalizingly close. However, the reality was different. The state of the art was neural nets, but they were only good at solving basic pattern-matching problems. While they could be tuned, they lacked true responsiveness and grasp. This left many skeptical about the grand promises of AI.

Acknowledging the solid ground for skepticism, the author highlights that past AI moments have often fallen short. However, the new AI moment, characterized by the transformer paradigm (such as ChatGPT and Midjourney), presents a different picture. While some may see consciousness or sentience in these AI systems, the reality is that they are still limited and far from true intelligence.

Despite these limitations, the new AI moment has garnered attention for its potential to surpass previous achievements. The transformer paradigm represents a shift in AI technology, displaying enhanced capabilities that seem more aligned with true intelligence. While skepticism should still remain, there is a growing sense that AI may finally be on the path to fulfilling its promises.

Overall, the essay makes a compelling case for why the current AI moment might be the real deal. With the transformer paradigm pushing the boundaries of AI capabilities, there is hope that we are witnessing a significant step forward in the field of artificial intelligence.

The discussion on this submission covers various aspects of AI and its potential, as well as debates regarding consciousness and intelligence. Here are some key points from the conversation:

- Some users argue that AI systems, including those based on the transformer paradigm, are not truly intelligent or conscious but are rather sophisticated pattern-matching machines.
- There is a debate about whether consciousness and free will can be replicated in AI systems or if they are unique to humans.
- The discussion also touches on the problem of defining and measuring intelligence and consciousness, with some users suggesting that they are subjective experiences that cannot be empirically tested.
- Others express concerns about the implications of advanced AI systems and the potential challenges they may present to human society.
- There is a disagreement about the feasibility of AI systems achieving self-awareness and true intelligence, with some users pointing out the limitations of current AI technology.

Overall, the discussion reflects a range of opinions and perspectives on the current state and future potential of AI, as well as the philosophical questions surrounding consciousness and intelligence.
