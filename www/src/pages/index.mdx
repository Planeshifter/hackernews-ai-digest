### What Nvidia's Blackwell efficiency gains mean for DC operators

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/27/nvidia_blackwell_efficiency/) | 43 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39840593)

Nvidia's recent Blackwell launch has sent ripples through the datacenter industry as operators grapple with the increasing power demands of modern CPUs and GPUs. With the unveiling of the 1,200W Blackwell GPUs at GTC, concerns about heat management are at the forefront. The adoption of technologies like rear-door heat exchangers and liquid cooling has become crucial for accommodating high-density deployments.

The Blackwell lineup, particularly the powerful GB200 NVL72 systems, is pushing the limits of standard air cooling with its significant heat output. Despite the challenges, Nvidia claims impressive gains in performance and efficiency with these chips. When analyzed in terms of raw floating point operations per watt, Blackwell showcases substantial efficiency improvements compared to previous models.

However, as power consumption increases beyond 700W, there are diminishing returns on performance, especially in air-cooled configurations like the DGX B200. Liquid cooling solutions like the GB200 NVL72 system demonstrate higher efficiency and performance, albeit with additional considerations for infrastructure like coolant distribution units.

Ultimately, datacenter operators need to carefully balance power, cooling, and efficiency considerations when adopting Nvidia's Blackwell systems. While the HGX B100 stands out as a relatively efficient choice, the DGX B200 offers a significant performance boost despite lower efficiency at full load. The real-world implications suggest a notable enhancement in compute density compared to previous generations, signaling a shift towards higher-performing yet power-hungry hardware.
