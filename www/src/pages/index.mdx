### RoboAgent: A universal agent with 12 Skills

#### [Submission URL](https://robopen.github.io/) | 132 points | by [reqo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reqo) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37167698)

Introducing RoboAgent: A Universal Robotic Agent with 12 Skills

The quest for a single robot that can manipulate any object in diverse settings has been a distant goal for decades. However, the lack of diverse robotics datasets and generic agents capable of generating such datasets has hindered progress. Enter RoboAgent, a universal robotic agent developed by a team at Carnegie Mellon University and Meta AI.

RoboAgent is a culmination of two years of work and aims to efficiently acquire multiple skills within a practical data budget and generalize them to unseen situations. The team built RoboPen, a distributed robotics infrastructure, and RoboHive, a framework for robot learning across simulation and real-world operations. They also created RoboSet, a high-quality dataset representing multiple skills with everyday objects in diverse scenarios.

To tackle the challenge of low-data regimes and overfitting, the team employed an efficient language conditioned multi-task offline imitation learning framework called MT-ACT. They used semantic augmentations to inject world priors from existing foundation models into the RoboSet dataset, creating a heavily multi-modal dataset with a rich diversity of skills, tasks, and scenarios. They then developed MT-ACT, a novel efficient policy representation that can handle this multi-modal dataset while avoiding overfitting.

RoboAgent was trained on just 7,500 trajectories, a fraction of the data used by previous methods, yet it exhibited 12 non-trivial manipulation skills across 38 tasks and could generalize to hundreds of diverse unseen scenarios. It even showed the ability to evolve its capabilities with new experiences.

The team also released the RoboSet dataset, consisting of 100,050 trajectories, and open-sourced their entire dataset to accelerate research in robot-learning. With RoboAgent's sample efficiency and ability to generalize, the dream of a universal robotic agent may be within reach.

The discussion on this submission begins with users commenting on the 12 skills that RoboAgent has learned. One user points out that there are skills beyond the 12 mentioned in the article. Another user jokingly adds "computer hacking skills" to the list. 

There are later comments discussing the related research paper "RT-2" and its comparison to "RT-1." 

One user criticizes the presentation format of the article, finding it somewhat contradictory and lacking in clarity.

A couple of comments question the purpose of RoboAgent and its skills. One user sarcastically states that it is a "battery god" while another user expresses their wish for 12 skills.

The discussion then shifts to comparing RoboAgent's achievements to those of Boston Dynamics. Some users express enthusiasm for the advancements in robotics, while others bring up the use of classical versus deep learning techniques and the need for AI to intersect with robotics.

There is a discussion about the comments section in general, with some users stating that negative comments are discouraging and hinder progress. A user adds that Boston Dynamics largely uses classical learning techniques and that AI research needs to focus on creating practical and usable results.

Other comments mention finding Boston Dynamics' GitHub resources and note that Boston Dynamics' robots perform tasks in a pre-programmed manner.

The discussion ends with one user praising Boston Dynamics' robots and their impressive abilities.

### Future Intel CPUs May Dump Hyper-Threading for Partitioned Thread Scheduling

#### [Submission URL](https://hothardware.com/news/future-intel-cpu-partition-threads) | 50 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37163191)

Intel is considering ditching Hyper-Threading in future CPUs in favor of a new technique called partitioned thread scheduling, according to a recently published patent. Hyper-Threading, which is Intel's version of simultaneous multi-threading (SMT), aims to improve occupancy and utilization of a processor core's functional units. However, it is not always efficient, as a single program thread rarely fills all of a processor's functional units. The new partitioned thread scheduling technique analyzes the work required by a thread and breaks application threads into segments using partitions. These partitioned threads are then scheduled onto processor cores based on their performance requirements. This technique aims to optimize core utilization and improve overall efficiency.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the implications of Intel potentially ditching Hyper-Threading in favor of partitioned thread scheduling. Some users express their skepticism about the performance benefits of Hyper-Threading, citing benchmark tests that showed minimal speed improvements. Others discuss the potential drawbacks of partitioned thread scheduling, such as increased cache misses and the need for software compatibility. 

One user mentions that Intel's Thread Director technology in Alder Lake CPUs may address some of the performance and power consumption issues associated with Hyper-Threading. Another user raises the point that the patent application does not necessarily indicate an imminent replacement of Hyper-Threading but rather suggests a possible alternative scheduling technique.

There is also a discussion about the difference between physical cores and logical cores and how Hyper-Threading fits into this context. Some users argue that physical cores are more important for performance and that SMT can lead to limiting factors and behavior that affect overall efficiency.

Overall, the discussion highlights various perspectives and considerations regarding the potential shift from Hyper-Threading to partitioned thread scheduling in future Intel CPUs.

### Ts_zip: Text Compression Using Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://bellard.org/ts_server/ts_zip.html) | 240 points | by [Deeg9rie9usi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Deeg9rie9usi) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37152978)

The ts_zip utility in the ts_server software has introduced a new way to compress text files using Large Language Models. Unlike other compression tools, ts_zip achieves significantly higher compression ratios. However, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. Firstly, the language model needs to be available during decompression. Additionally, a GPU is necessary to achieve reasonable speeds, and it's crucial to use the same GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression. 

The compression ratio for each model is measured in bits per byte. CMIX v19 is particularly impressive in terms of compression. The table provided shows the compression ratios for various files, including alice29.txt, book1, enwik8, and linux-1.2.13.tar.

When compressing the book1 file on an RTX A6000 GPU, the compression speed and required GPU memory are measured. Interestingly, the decompression speed and memory requirements are similar. Different models, such as rwkv_169M, rwkv_430M, pythia_deduped_70M, rwkv_7B_q4, and falcon_7B_q4, are compared in terms of compression speed and GPU memory usage.

In conclusion, the smaller RWKV models seem to strike a good balance for text compression. They utilize less memory due to their RNN structure and offer relatively high compression speeds. Fabrice Bellard, the developer behind ts_zip, is the mastermind behind this innovative text compression utility.

The discussion surrounding the ts_zip utility focuses on various aspects of text compression using Large Language Models (LLMs). Some comments discuss the potential limitations and challenges of using LLMs for compression. One user points out that the models require the availability of the language model during decompression, and another highlights the need for a compatible GPU model and program versions for compression and decompression.

### Bayesian Flow Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07037) | 81 points | by [albertzeyer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=albertzeyer) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37134315)

A new paper titled "Bayesian Flow Networks" introduces a new class of generative models called Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs). BFNs modify the parameters of independent distributions using Bayesian inference based on noisy data samples. These modified parameters are then passed as input to a neural network that outputs a second, interdependent distribution. This generative procedure is similar to the reverse process of diffusion models but simpler since no forward process is required. The paper derives discrete and continuous-time loss functions for different types of data and proposes sample generation procedures. BFNs achieve competitive log-likelihoods for image modeling and outperform existing discrete diffusion models on a character-level language modeling task. The network inputs for discrete data are on the probability simplex, making it possible to use gradient-based sample guidance and few-step generation in discrete domains like language modeling. The paper provides a significant contribution to the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence.

The discussion around the submission includes a variety of topics. One user provides links to threads on Twitter and Reddit that discuss the paper's findings, with another user mentioning that Schmidhuber has mentioned the paper as well.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/08/21/the-man-who-organized-nature-the-life-of-linnaeus-gunnar-broberg-book-review) | 45 points | by [Petiver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Petiver) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129417)

The Tyrannosaurus rex, despite being extinct for millions of years, continues to captivate people's imaginations. Thanks to the likes of Michael Crichton and Steven Spielberg, as well as the fascination of elementary-school children, the T. rex remains a widely recognized dinosaur. In scientific circles, the T. rex is known by its proper scientific name, Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex for short. This name follows the binomial nomenclature system, which assigns a two-part name (genus and species) to every species on Earth. While binomial names are important to scientists, they are rarely used in everyday conversation. However, they still play a vital role in fields like molecular biology and evolutionary ecology.

### What coal and Jevons’ paradox tell us about AI and data

#### [Submission URL](https://hex.tech/blog/jevons-paradox-demand-for-insight/) | 70 points | by [erehweb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erehweb) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37129853)

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning models (LLMs) has raised concerns about the future of data jobs. Will computers replace human data practitioners? According to a blog post by Barry McCardel, the job of a data practitioner is more than just writing code or making charts. It involves formulating the right questions, anticipating the needs of stakeholders, and providing valuable insights. While AI can automate certain rote tasks, it is unlikely to replace the human element of data work.

McCardel draws a parallel to Jevons' Paradox, which observed that as coal-powered engines became more efficient, overall coal consumption increased. The same rebound effect could apply to AI and data. As the cost of generating insights decreases, the demand for data work and the number of questions that can be answered with data will likely increase. Organizations are supply-constrained when it comes to utilizing data, and AI can help unlock the untapped potential of data teams.

While AI will undoubtedly change how data practitioners work, McCardel argues that it will likely lead to an increased need for human hours rather than a decrease. The impact of data on organizations is far from reaching its theoretical limit, and AI can help data teams be more impactful. McCardel concludes by discussing Hex, a platform that enables the creation and sharing of interactive data products, and invites readers to explore opportunities with the company.

Overall, the blog post highlights the potential of AI to augment rather than replace human data practitioners, and the exciting possibilities that lie ahead in the field of data analysis.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the blog post's main points about AI and the future of data jobs. One commenter agrees with the post, saying that AI may take over low-value tasks but will not replace the higher-level strategic work that humans can do. They argue that as technology progresses, there is a shift in the types of jobs available. Another commenter brings up the concern that AI may replace non-essential service vendors and result in organizational changes. 

There is also a discussion about the impact of automation on different types of jobs. Some argue that AI will lead to an increase in the need for human hours rather than a decrease. Others point out that certain jobs, like manual labor, may be more easily replaced by automation, while others believe that higher-skilled jobs will still be in demand. The potential impact on the middle class is also mentioned.

Another comment highlights the importance of natural language communication, social and emotional intelligence, and decision-making in certain professions, suggesting that AI may not fully replace these roles. However, another commenter challenges this notion, stating that AI has the potential to approximate decision-makers and replace jobs traditionally done by lower-skilled workers. They argue that humans are not horses and will adapt to new roles.

There is also a discussion about the current and future job market and the creation of new roles. Some argue that the current job market is not representative of the future, and there is uncertainty about the impact of AI on employment. Others discuss the changing dynamics in households and the increase in multiple jobs held by individuals.
