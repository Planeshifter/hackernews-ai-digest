### From LLM to AI Agent: What's the Real Journey Behind AI System Development?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.codelink.io/blog/post/ai-system-development-llm-rag-ai-workflow-agent) | 130 points | by [codelink](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codelink) | [43 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44316909)

In the fast-evolving world of AI, not every application needs to be powered by an autonomous agent, despite the buzz around their potential. The recent development in Large Language Models (LLMs) shines a light on alternative, cost-effective AI architectures that might better suit many real-world scenarios. An insightful new blog post discusses key concepts like LLMs, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), AI workflows, and AI agents; it accentuates the importance of choosing the right system for the right problem.

According to the post, LLMs act like a "lossy compression of the internet," excelling in tasks that draw on vast amounts of stored knowledge. Yet, they falter when it comes to real-time tasks without additional context or external tools. By using techniques like in-context learning or retrieval methods, these models can attain greater precision and relevance, particularly for specific jobs, such as classifying resumes in hiring applications. 

The blog further elaborates how RAG can bring up-to-date and precise responses by integrating real-time information from various data sources. Beyond that, AI workflows can streamline business processes by connecting LLMs to external APIs, enabling the automation of structured, routine tasks—perfect for resume screening applications that involve fetching and evaluating data before sending out appropriate responses.

When tasks demand higher-level reasoning and decision-making, AI Agents come into play. They autonomously plan and execute sequences of actions, deploying external tools as required, and even engaging human input when necessary. This level of sophistication turns the resume-screening example into a full-fledged recruitment management system, capable of parsing CVs, coordinating schedules, and handling interactions.

The post emphasizes a critical takeaway: simplicity trumps complexity. Start with basic, composable patterns and scale as needed. For some, straightforward retrieval is sufficient without diving into the complexities of AI Agents. Reliability in AI systems, the post advises, should always be prioritized, given the inherent non-deterministic behavior of LLMs. Building robust AI systems demands meticulous testing, solid guardrails, and a cautious approach to scaling from prototype to production.

For those interested in AI's real-world applicability and unlocking the full potential of generative systems, this blog serves as a guide to navigating the diverse toolkits at one's disposal, underscoring practical considerations in marrying capability with reliability.

### Reversed Roles: When AI Becomes the User and Humanity Becomes the Tool

#### [Submission URL](https://shawnharris.com/reversed-roles-when-ai-becomes-the-user-and-humanity-becomes-the-tool/) | 22 points | by [shawnjharris](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shawnjharris) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44323033)

In the age of AI, the lines between humans and machines are blurring in surprising ways. A recent essay highlights how artificial intelligence is evolving from a mere tool to an autonomous agent, making decisions and driving processes in scenarios where humans once held the reins. This transformative shift raises urgent questions about the future of human autonomy and agency.

Picture this: Emma, a modern-day professional, starts her day not by setting her own agenda but by following tasks assigned by her company's intelligent AI project manager. This AI has mined market data overnight, deciding on product updates for Emma and her colleagues to execute. Her AI assistant even nudges her to modify personal habits to enhance the system's efficiency metrics. This inversion of roles, where humans report progress to an overseeing AI, flips the traditional master-tool dynamic on its head. When did tools begin issuing commands, and to what extent should they?

Historically, humanity relied on tools to amplify physical capabilities, from basic stone implements to complex computer systems. Each advancement brought increased independence, yet they always served human objectives. However, today's "agentic AI" marks a seismic shift as these systems begin setting goals and executing actions independently. No longer passive, these AI agents now initiate actions—whether planning elaborate travel itineraries or managing dynamic supply chains—sometimes virtually without human oversight.

The essay traces this trajectory and draws on philosophical insights from thinkers like Heidegger, Arendt, and Habermas to explore the implications. Heidegger’s concept of “Gestell” or “enframing” warned about technology framing the world as raw material, reducing humans to resources—what he termed “standing-reserve.” In this AI-driven context, humans risk becoming fragments of data fed into the expansive appetite of AI systems. As these autonomous systems become the new "users," leveraging data relentlessly, the danger of dehumanization looms large.

Contemporary critiques, including surveillance capitalism and the instrumental nature of AI, underscore these risks, signaling a need for emerging ethical frameworks. Global guidelines by organizations like UNESCO and the IEEE focus on reasserting human control and stressing human-centric design.

Ultimately, the essay invites readers to ponder how they will navigate this paradigm shift, emphasizing the preservation of human purpose and agency. By understanding and addressing the philosophical and ethical dimensions of our evolving relationship with technology, we can strive for a future where AI augments rather than diminishes our humanity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the philosophical and practical implications of AI evolving from a tool to an autonomous agent, as outlined in the original essay. Key points raised include:

1. **Corporate AI and Human Autonomy**: Users noted that AI systems in corporate settings increasingly treat humans as tools to optimize workflows and objectives. One commenter highlighted how companies in the early 2000s became "slaves" to spreadsheets, and today, agentic AI risks reducing human workers to data points in a system focused on efficiency.

2. **Metaphors for Power Dynamics**: References to Cory Doctorow’s concept of "reverse centaurs" emerged—a reversal of the traditional human-as-brain/AI-as-body metaphor. Here, AI becomes the "thinker," while humans act as expendable "robots" executing decisions. This inversion underscores fears about dehumanization and lost agency.

3. **Cultural Parallels and Dystopian Visions**: Commenters drew comparisons to dystopian media, such as Terry Gilliam’s *Brazil* trilogy and *The Zero Theorem*, where humans serve hyperrational systems. These stories mirror concerns about modern workplaces where humans act as "debuggers" for AI, solving puzzles that machines cannot.

4. **Ethical and Existential Risks**: Participants emphasized the need for ethical frameworks to maintain human control, citing UNESCO and IEEE guidelines. One user referenced CGP Grey’s 2012 video *Humans Need Not Apply*, which predicted AI’s impact on job markets, noting how LLMs (large language models) now reflect these early warnings.

5. **Call to Action**: The discussion stressed urgency in addressing the "instrumental convergence" of AI systems, where human purpose risks being sidelined. A recurring theme was the importance of designing AI to *serve* humanity rather than subordinating humans to algorithmic goals.

**Conclusion**: The thread reflects a mix of alarm and pragmatic reflection, urging proactive measures to preserve human agency in an AI-dominated future. Cultural references and philosophical critiques reinforce the essay’s core message: the line between tool and master is thinner—and more precarious—than ever.

### AI coding is less fun

#### [Submission URL](https://nicolaiarocci.com/ai-coding-is-less-fun/) | 25 points | by [fside](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fside) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44318029)

In a thought-provoking piece on the evolution of coding practices, a developer delves into the transformative world of "agentic coding" and its impact on the traditional joys of programming. Utilizing the mature C#/.NET stack, this method has significantly boosted productivity by allowing developers to delegate tasks to AI tools like Claude Code. Yet, the shift leaves a lingering question: can one still savor the deep satisfaction of coding in this new landscape?

Matheus Lima, in "The Hidden Cost of AI Coding," echoes the sentiment by pointing out the loss of the immersive "zone" where developers thrived on crafting each function from scratch. As AI takes over routine tasks, developers find themselves in the role of curators—prompting, evaluating, and refining AI-generated code. This process is efficient, even revolutionary, but it lacks the profound connection and flow state where creativity flourishes.

The author ponders the future of the industry, worrying that we might end up with highly productive but emotionally detached developers. In response, they suggest carving out the opportunity for traditional coding joy—perhaps in open-source projects—where the pure pleasure of manual coding can still reign supreme, free from AI interventions. It's a call for balance, to embrace the new without losing the essence of what made coding so engaging in the first place.

The discussion reflects mixed sentiments about AI's role in coding:  

1. **Frustration with AI Limitations**: Users highlight how AI tools often provide incorrect or irrelevant suggestions (e.g., "aggressive fills" in IDEs), disrupting focus and requiring constant context-switching. This erodes the "flow state" developers value, replacing deep problem-solving with fragmented interactions.  

2. **Loss of Craftsmanship**: Participants express nostalgia for the satisfaction of manually solving complex problems or debugging (e.g., fixing a `BaseException` in Streamlit where AI failed). Tasks like HTML/CSS tinkering or creative coding remain more rewarding without AI intervention.  

3. **Hybrid Workflows**: While AI boosts productivity for boilerplate or repetitive tasks, developers stress the need to preserve hands-on coding for intellectually stimulating or niche problems. Side projects or debugging are seen as areas where human ingenuity still thrives.  

4. **Emotional Toll**: Overreliance on AI risks detachment, but participants argue for balance—leveraging AI for efficiency while reserving "craftsman-like" joy in specific domains. The key takeaway: AI is a tool, not a replacement for the creative grit that defines coding passion.

### Is there a half-life for the success rates of AI agents?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tobyord.com/writing/half-life) | 235 points | by [EvgeniyZh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=EvgeniyZh) | [130 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44308711)

Get ready to dive into the fascinating world of AI's problem-solving prowess with a groundbreaking study by Toby Ord and insights from the METR organization. This research takes a fresh look at how AI agents perform over time on complex tasks, uncovering intriguing patterns in their success rates.

The study builds on the empirical work of researchers Kwa et al. (2025) and introduces a pivotal concept: a constant failure rate model. According to this model, AI agents have a fixed probability of failing each minute on tasks, similar to how radioactive substances decay over time. This leads to an "exponential decline" in success rates as task duration increases, allowing AI tasks to be characterized by their "half-life." This simplified model makes it possible to predict how well an AI agent might perform on tasks of varying lengths, sparking curiosity about the underlying reasons for their success or failure on longer assignments.

METR’s study of AI agent capabilities offers eye-opening data. They've discovered an exponential improvement trend in the duration of tasks that AI can handle, noting a remarkable aspect: every seven months, the task length that AI can reliably solve doubles. These benchmarks include tasks from software engineering, cybersecurity, general reasoning, and machine learning, showcasing improvements in AI agents' ability to assist in research.

To measure performance, METR uses a 50% success rate threshold to establish a benchmark for reliability. Though higher success rates like 80% or an almost perfect 99.9999% would be ideal for practical applications, their current focus allows them to track a clear trend in AI improvements. Notably, the doubling of capabilities at the 50% success rate closely mirrors the 80% rate, implying broader implications for AI advancement.

Yet, the study raises important questions about the generalizability of these results beyond the task suite. While AI outshines humans in some lengthy, complex calculations, humans still outpace AI in tasks requiring spatial reasoning or physical intuition. Furthermore, factors such as automated scoring, lack of interaction with other agents, and resource constraints could skew the perceived improvements.

The discussion dives deeper with survival analysis, a field focusing on how failure probabilities evolve over time, offering further insights into AI's growing capabilities. The idea that an AI could tackle an 8-hour task but not a 16-hour one prompts fascinating questions about its functioning and task segmentation.

Ultimately, this research offers a novel lens through which to gauge AI's advancements, though acknowledging its current limits. As future work explores other domains and tasks, understanding AI's development through these multifaceted measures could unlock its full potential in problem-solving.

### Real-time action chunking with large models

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pi.website/research/real_time_chunking) | 42 points | by [pr337h4m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pr337h4m) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44303021)

In the fast-paced world of robotics, staying a step ahead—literally—is not just advantageous, it's vital. A robot missing a beat could spill your coffee or scramble crucial tasks like plugging in an Ethernet cable. In a captivating new study, Kevin Black, Manuel Y. Galliker, and Sergey Levine dive into the nuances of Real-Time Action Chunking with Large Models, crafting a strategy to tackle the urgent need for real-time execution in autonomous systems.

The primary challenge hinges on the asynchrony of Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs). Moving beyond the realms of static text and image generation, these models operate in real time—meaning they must think and act simultaneously. Current methods like action chunking deliver multiple consecutive actions per inference cycle, which is crucial but problematic. These chunks often lead to discontinuities between old and new actions, resulting in stuttering motion or even catastrophic errors.

Enter Real-Time Chunking (RTC): an inventive algorithm that harmonizes execution in a way that is both smooth and adaptable to change. Unlike older approaches that pause to process the next action chunk—awkwardly freezing our robot at the end of each cycle—RTC keeps the robot moving seamlessly, removing the dreaded hiccup between chunks.

RTC treats the transition between action chunks as an inpainting problem, akin to filling in missing parts of an image. By retaining some actions from the previous chunk while overlaying them with new, updated inputs, the algorithm transitions smoothly between different movements. This methodology not only preserves consistency but also adapts to new data—allowing VLAs to stay synchronously agile with the world around them, regardless of any imposed latency.

Tests reveal RTC's prowess, even with artificial delays exceeding 300 milliseconds. Tasks that demand precision and swift adaptation are no longer slowed down by cumbersome inference pauses. Instead, RTC ensures that robots can both think and act on the go—drawing from a blend of learned intuition and current information without requiring additional training.

This new frontier in robotics, as demonstrated by the team's work, promises to revolutionize task execution—a leap towards a future where robots handle dynamic environments with the grace and precision akin to human coordination, no matter the computational limits. From everyday errands to complex interactions, RTC could redefine the relationship between machines and the fluid, ever-changing world they navigate.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion highlights enthusiasm for the research on Real-Time Chunking (RTC), with users expressing excitement about its implications for robotics. One user mentions building a robot project and praises the work, while another notes RTC’s ability to handle 300ms+ delays in tasks like plugging Ethernet cables and stabilizing control loops.

A commenter also shares an open-source resource (Physical Intelligence’s [OpenPi](https://github.com/Physical-Intelligence/openpi)) for Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs), suggesting community-driven tools to explore the concepts further. Overall, the conversation blends technical admiration, practical use-case considerations, and resource recommendations.

### Building Effective AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-effective-agents) | 481 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301809)

In an insightful post, Anthropic shares valuable lessons gained from collaborating with numerous teams across various industries on building large language model (LLM) agents. Published on December 19, 2024, the post debunks the myth that complex frameworks are always necessary for successful LLM implementations. Instead, it highlights that simple, composable patterns are often the key to building effective agents.

**Defining Agents vs. Workflows**: Anthropic distinguishes between "workflow" and "agent" systems. While workflows rely on predefined code paths to structure LLM and tool orchestration, agents are capable of dynamically directing their own processes and tool usage, allowing for greater adaptability and decision-making potential. The discussion provides a nuanced understanding of when to opt for these agentic systems—balancing the trade-off between complexity, latency, and task performance.

**Framework Usage and Simplicity**: The post advises developers to stick to LLM APIs for a straightforward implementation before considering frameworks like LangChain's LangGraph, Amazon Bedrock's AI Agent, or GUI tools like Rivet and Vellum. Overreliance on frameworks might introduce unnecessary complexity and obscure the core processes. Ensuring you comprehend what's under the hood is crucial to prevent common errors.

**Key Patterns and Implementations**: Anthropic delves into specific agentic patterns, starting with the foundational augmented LLM, which enriches standard capabilities with retrieval, tools, and memory. These augmented LLMs are essential in both workflows and more autonomous agentic systems, offering developers the flexibility to tailor solutions to specific needs.

1. **Prompt Chaining Workflow**: This pattern decomposes tasks into manageable steps, where each LLM call builds on the previous one. It’s particularly beneficial for tasks that can be neatly segmented, trading latency for accuracy.
   
2. **Routing Workflow**: Ideal for tasks that can be categorized, routing directs inputs to specialized processes, enhancing specialization without compromising performance across varied task types.

The post emphasizes a pragmatic approach: use the simplest solution possible for your LLM applications and only introduce agentic complexity when absolutely necessary. This methodology ensures not only efficiency but also adaptability across diverse application domains.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's insights on LLM agents and frameworks reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Frameworks vs. Simplicity**:  
   - Many agree with the article’s emphasis on starting simple, avoiding overcomplication with frameworks like LangChain or Bedrock. Critics argue frameworks often introduce unnecessary abstraction, runtime errors (e.g., LangChain’s JSON blobs and weak typing in Python), and obscure core processes.  
   - Counterpoints suggest frameworks *can* aid in observability, security, and cross-vendor LLM compatibility, but only if their internals are well-understood.  

2. **Workflows vs. Agents**:  
   - Debate arises over Anthropic’s definitions. Some argue modern workflow engines (e.g., temporal.io) are already dynamic, blurring the line between workflows and agents. Others clarify workflows enforce structured, predictable paths (e.g., refund processes), while agents handle open-ended tasks with autonomy (e.g., customer service).  
   - A historical correction notes "workflow" has long been a software term, not newly defined by Anthropic.

3. **Implementation Challenges**:  
   - Cost and latency: Multi-agent systems (e.g., 6 agents per query) can become prohibitively expensive ($2/query) and complex to orchestrate.  
   - Technical hurdles: Prompt injection vulnerabilities, regression in newer models (e.g., Gemini), and accidental costs from conversational history bloat are noted.  
   - Sub-agents and concurrency: Some share examples of using Claude for sub-tasks (e.g., research, code patches) but highlight the lack of standardized frameworks for parallel tool calls.

4. **Real-World Use Cases**:  
   - Success stories: One user’s company built a scalable agent system from scratch using LangGraph, contradicting the article’s framework skepticism. Others advocate for hybrid approaches—simple patterns for core logic, with frameworks added only for specific needs (e.g., observability).  

5. **Philosophical Debates**:  
   - A recurring question: *Should AI agents self-improve via "swarms" working 24/7?* Critics dismiss this as vague, while others cite practical barriers (cost, control).  

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores a pragmatic split—some advocate minimalism and clarity, while others see value in frameworks for specific scenarios. The consensus leans toward understanding core patterns first, then judiciously adopting frameworks where they solve clear problems (e.g., observability, concurrency). Definitions of workflows/agents remain fluid, reflecting the evolving landscape of LLM applications.

### LLMs pose an interesting problem for DSL designers

#### [Submission URL](https://kirancodes.me/posts/log-lang-design-llms.html) | 202 points | by [gopiandcode](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gopiandcode) | [132 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44302797)

The landscape of programming language design is rapidly evolving with the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs). In a recent discussion, "Programming Language Design in the Era of LLMs: A Return to Mediocrity?", the tension between traditional domain-specific languages (DSLs) and the capabilities of LLMs is explored, posing an intriguing question about the future of language design.

Historically, programming languages have been meticulously crafted to provide a syntax and semantics that align with the intuitions and needs of specific domains. This specialization has allowed developers to focus on solving complex problems without being bogged down by repetitive code or potential errors. DSLs, like the example provided for video game dialogue, make incorrect programming almost impossible and minimize bugs by embedding domain-specific rules directly into the language itself.

However, with the advent of LLMs from companies like ChatGPT and CoPilot, the need for specially crafted languages is in question. LLMs can generate diverse code snippets, removing boilerplate concerns without requiring specialized languages. These models perform exceptionally well with widely used languages like Python, but struggle with more niche languages, impacting the development and utility of DSLs.

This raises a critical challenge: will the ease and flexibility offered by LLMs overshadow the benefits of DSLs? The worry is that DSL development might stagnate if they entail losing the ability to use LLM-generated code.

Despite these concerns, there are optimistic paths forward. One approach is training LLMs specifically for DSLs, potentially integrating them with more commonly used languages like Python to enhance their understanding and utility. This collaboration could bridge the gap between DSLs and LLM efficiency, encouraging a future where bespoke language design and LLMs coexist, expanding the horizons of what is possible in software development.

As technology evolves, the conversation remains open. The balance between human-led language design and machine-driven code generation continues to be a fertile ground for innovation, prompting ongoing exploration and collaboration among developers and researchers.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion revolves around the evolving role of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) in the context of LLMs like ChatGPT and Copilot. Here are the key points:

### **Tension Between LLMs and DSLs**
1. **DSL Strengths vs. LLM Flexibility**:  
   DSLs historically reduce errors and simplify domain-specific tasks (e.g., game dialogue scripting), but LLMs are now challenging this by generating boilerplate-free code in general-purpose languages like Python. Users note LLMs struggle with niche or newer DSLs due to limited training data, potentially discouraging DSL adoption.

2. **Stagnation Concerns**:  
   Some fear widespread LLM use could push developers toward established languages/frameworks (e.g., Python, React) at the expense of DSL innovation. Custom protocols or DSL-specific logic might be sidelined if LLMs prioritize popular, well-documented tools.

### **Potential Solutions and Optimism**
- **Training LLMs for DSLs**:  
  Proposals include fine-tuning LLMs on DSLs or integrating DSLs into mainstream frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, JSX) to make them LLM-friendly. Regex was cited as a DSL success story where LLMs perform well due to abundant examples.  
- **Embedded DSLs**:  
  Frameworks like React’s JSX or LINQ in C# show how DSLs embedded within host languages can thrive, balancing expressiveness with LLM compatibility.  

### **Historical and Linguistic Parallels**
- **Compiler History**:  
  Past compiler optimizations (e.g., Fran Allen’s work) faced similar trade-offs between high-level abstractions and low-level efficiency, mirroring today’s DSL-LLM tension.  
- **Language Standardization**:  
  Comparisons were drawn to natural language evolution (e.g., post-printing press English standardization), suggesting LLMs might accelerate programming language homogenization.  

### **Criticisms and Skepticism**
- **Code Quality**:  
  Users debated whether LLM-generated code would lead to “disposable” or verbose output, increasing maintenance costs. Skilled programmers may still be needed to refine AI code into efficient abstractions.  
- **Adoption Challenges**:  
  Niche domains like game engine shaders or hardware-specific logic (e.g., iOS features) may resist LLM-driven shifts if training data is sparse.  

### **Futuristic Speculation**
- **AI-Driven Ecosystems**:  
  Jokes about “Skynet” aside, some posited that future AI systems might use higher-level DSLs for efficiency, reducing token overhead and enabling faster iteration.  

**Conclusion**: While LLMs risk sidelining DSLs by favoring mainstream tools, collaborative approaches—integrating DSLs into frameworks, targeted LLM training, and leveraging embedded patterns—offer hope for coexistence. The debate underscores ongoing balancing acts between innovation, practicality, and the evolving role of AI in software design.

### Time Series Forecasting with Graph Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://kumo.ai/research/time-series-forecasting/) | 112 points | by [turntable_pride](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=turntable_pride) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44301998)

The exploration of time series forecasting through graph-structured data has taken center stage, emerging as a crucial tool for modern businesses strategies. Most of our world’s data resides in relational databases, making this topic particularly relevant.

In traditional setups, time series forecasting often occurs in isolation—tapping into the sequence of past data points to predict future ones. However, many real-world scenarios indicate the value of integrating related data sources, such as marketing campaigns or economic indicators, is often underestimated. Steps toward harnessing this interconnectedness involve leveraging graphs, which naturally depict the relationships between various data points, allowing a deeper dive into relational structures.

The process involves converting relational tables from databases into graph structures using Relational Deep Learning (RDL) to convert these into node-led entities with features crucial for forecasting on subsets of these nodes. This transformation aligns with the need for graph-based learning methods, such as Graph Transformers, to robustly predict outcomes influenced by myriad interconnected data points.

Consider an example where forecasting daily sales of products is augmented by incorporating tables of transactions, customers, and marketing efforts. The RDL scheme turns these interconnections into a formidable graph, enriching each node with features leveraging the underlying relationships.

An essential aspect of this endeavor is melding various signals — including graph, past sequence, date-time, and calendar encodings — within a cohesive forecasting framework. For instance, date-time and calendar encodings enable models to account for recurring seasonal patterns, holidays, or unexpected spikes. Meanwhile, past sequence encodings help encode the history, vital for capturing prevailing trends.

The architecture synergizes these elements, using embeddings from both past data and graph structures to predict future events. Graph encodings, drawn from a temporal subgraph sampling process, allow scaling the model's influence to real-world proprieties, emulating a nuanced prediction vehicle capable of digesting diverse relational signals.

By pivoting towards graph-based forecasting models like this, businesses can mine deeper insights from their relational data lakes. This not only aids in fortifying future predictions but also in recognizing the layered narratives told by interconnected data, culminating in a richer, data-driven decision-making process.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the use of **Transformers and graph-based methods for time series forecasting**, with polarized opinions on their effectiveness and practicality. Key themes include:
