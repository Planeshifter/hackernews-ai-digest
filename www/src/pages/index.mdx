#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Danau5tin/terminal-bench-rl) | 123 points | by [Danau5tin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Danau5tin) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44721791)

In today’s top story from Hacker News, we dive into an impressive project involving reinforcement learning (RL) and terminal-based agents. A developer named Danau5tin has created an RL training framework, successfully scaling it to utilize 32x H100 GPUs across four nodes for long-horizon terminal and coding tasks. This ambitious project extends upon UC Berkeley's rLLM framework, specifically tailoring it for training sophisticated terminal-based agents.

The highlight of this endeavor, known as Terminal-Agent-Qwen3-32b, has outperformed major competitors like Stanford's Terminus-Qwen3-235B-30A and even OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with Codex agent, claiming the top spot for Qwen3 agents on the prestigious TerminalBench leaderboard. However, due to the substantial compute costs—estimated between £30k-£50k—the project couldn't reach its full training potential on available resources.

Danau5tin ingeniously designed custom environments and tools, providing agents with capabilities akin to planning, file operations, search functions, and bash execution—all essential for tackling complex terminal tasks. The project integrates a dynamic judge evaluation system and employs both reward design and a structured action-based architecture to ensure agent effectiveness.

Despite not being able to complete a full training cycle due to computational constraints, Danau5tin’s work sets a foundation for anyone with access to substantial GPU resources to further train and explore the potential of RL in terminal tasks. This project not only showcases the power of reinforcement learning in niche applications but also marks a significant milestone in terminal-based RL agent development.

### Supervised fine tuning on curated data is reinforcement learning

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12856) | 66 points | by [GabrielBianconi](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GabrielBianconi) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44727788)

Machine learning enthusiasts, take note: a new research paper spotted on arXiv, titled "Supervised Fine Tuning on Curated Data is Reinforcement Learning (and can be improved)" by Chongli Qin and Jost Tobias Springenberg, offers intriguing insights into the realms of behavior cloning and supervised fine-tuning. The authors argue that the common practice of using supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on curated data can actually be seen as a form of reinforcement learning (RL), specifically within a sparse reward context.

What's exciting is the introduction of a novel approach called importance weighted supervised fine-tuning (iw-SFT), which tweaks the traditional SFT method to optimize a tighter RL objective. This simple yet effective modification can enhance performance by aligning more closely with RL training methods.

Illustrating its potential, the iw-SFT variant shows competitive results, matching up against advanced RL algorithms, especially in tasks involving large language models and continuous control tasks. It even managed to achieve an admirable 66.7% performance on the AIME 2024 dataset. For those interested in diving deeper, complete details and the code are available through the project's website.

This development holds promise for anyone working with large language models or imitation learning, as it bridges the gap between classical supervised learning and reinforcement learning, potentially unlocking new avenues for enhancing model performance.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Practical Applications & Cost Savings**:  
   User **nndvsn** highlights experiments showing that fine-tuning smaller models on curated outputs from larger models drastically reduces inference costs (30x lower) and speeds up performance (4x faster). Tests involved navigation, RAG, and multi-hop QA tasks. The approach competes with closed-source (OpenAI, Google) and open-source models (Qwen), suggesting small models can rival large ones at a fraction of the cost.

2. **Code Sharing & Tooling**:  
   The authors (e.g., **chnglqn**, likely Chongli Qin) shared a GitHub link to the iw-SFT code. **GabrielBianconi** mentioned a related GPU-optimization tool (Unsloth) and an ongoing pull request for further integration.

3. **Technical Debates on RL vs. SFT**:  
   - **ndnfrth** and **mtrngd** questioned framing SFT as RL, arguing RL involves sequential decision-making, not just single-step optimization. **mtrngd** critiqued conflating SFT with Q-Learning, noting RL's focus on cumulative rewards.  
   - **chnglqn** countered that their method uses REINFORCE-style policy gradients to bridge SFT and RL, particularly in sparse-reward settings (common in LLMs).

4. **Benchmark Critique**:  
   **stlncd** criticized the paper’s 66.7% score on AIME 2024, comparing it to a "D-" grade and noting it’s a 12th-grade-level benchmark. Others (**sprmdgy**, **jpcmprtr**) countered that modest results are still valuable, with **stlncd** later conceding it might equate to a "B+" relative to students.

5. **Industry Context**:  
   **hnrqgdy** emphasized the potential for smaller, distilled models to address compliance and communication issues in enterprises. **jtsprngnbrg** (Jost Springenberg) clarified the work was an independent effort (not an official DeepMind project), sparking interest in its origins.

**Key Takeaways**:  
The discussion reflects enthusiasm for iw-SFT’s cost-effectiveness and technical novelty but includes skepticism about its RL framing and benchmark rigor. The community values code accessibility and sees potential in distilling smaller models, though debates around methodology and evaluation persist.

### Playing with Open Source LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://alicegg.tech//2025/07/29/open-source-llm.html) | 73 points | by [zer0tonin](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=zer0tonin) | [50 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44726838)

In a world where AI advancements are rolling in like waves on a beach, our intrepid coder decides to venture out of their comfort zone every six months to explore the latest tools. This time, the buzz was around AI-enhanced command-line tools, specifically tailored for writing code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Entering the spotlight is Claude Code, a tool that promises full autonomy in coding activities, from searching to committing code. However, our reluctant tech enthusiast remains wary of investing in potentially temporary vendor solutions.

To avoid getting trapped in costly or evolving services, they embarked on a journey through the open-source landscape in search of a suitable LLM for coding tasks. They tested various models, including the popular deepseek-r1:8b from China, the French contender mistral:7b, and Alibaba's qwen3:8b. After much trial and error, the qwen3:8b emerged as the favored model due to its balance between accuracy and usability on local setups.

For running these models locally, the coder set up an API using Ollama, a tool likened to Docker but specifically for LLMs, offering an easy way to manage and run these models. With the local API ready, they paired it with 'aider,' a pair programming application designed to work collaboratively with the model. Aider aids in passing context, running linters, and making code changes.

Our explorer then put the setup to the test. In a refactoring task within the Itako project, aider managed to make the instructed changes but ventured outside the task’s scope—a reminder of the tool's current developmental stage. Despite the intrigue, the time investment didn't justify the marginal output improvement for small tasks. For a fresh, greenfield project, however, the coder is keen to see what their new digital assistant can accomplish, leaving endless possibilities and hopefully more productive coding sessions on the horizon.

This adventure reflects the perpetual journey of developers in keeping pace with technological evolution, always weighing the complexities of AI tools against their practical benefits. As the coder retires to their proverbial cave, they do so with fresh insights and a renewed toolkit for future coding endeavors.

While these models can generate functional code, smaller models (e.g., 8B) struggle with complex coding tasks compared to larger ones. However, they remain cost-effective for basic usage or specific applications like text processing.
   - Skepticism persists about whether small models will ever match the performance of larger counterparts, though advances like "mixture of experts" architectures and distillation techniques offer hope.

2. **Open-Source Definitions for AI Models:**
   - Debate erupted over what qualifies an AI model as "open-source." Critics argued that the Open Source Initiative (OSI) has relaxed standards by not requiring training data release, leading to models like Llama being labeled "open" despite opaque training processes.
   - Some users emphasized that true openness requires releasing not just weights and inference code, but also training data, preprocessing scripts, and documentation to enable reproducibility. Others countered that practical constraints (e.g., legal issues with web-scraped data) make full transparency unrealistic.

3. **Local vs. Cloud Trade-offs:**
   - Running models locally saves costs and avoids vendor lock-in but demands significant hardware resources. Users highlighted tools like Ollama for local LLM management, though cost-benefit trade-offs arise when comparing local setups to cloud-based, proprietary models (e.g., ChatGPT).

4. **Ethical and Transparency Concerns:**
   - Concerns were raised about "Trojan horse" risks with closed training data, where models might inadvertently include biased or harmful content. Proposals for stricter open-model criteria included licensing guardrails (e.g., O-RAIL) and auditability of training corpora.

5. **Industry Dynamics:**
   - Criticisms targeted tech companies for co-opting "open-source" branding without meeting traditional standards (e.g., Meta’s Llama license restrictions). Calls were made for new frameworks (e.g., "Fair Software") to address gaps between AI models and classic open-source software principles.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a community grappling with the rapid evolution of AI tools, balancing excitement over local, open-source LLMs with frustrations over definitions of openness and skepticism about their current limitations compared to proprietary alternatives.

In an intriguing twist of digital serendipity, Hacker News has stumbled upon "Claude Finds Contradictions in My Thinking," a cerebral exploration by an AI, Claude, as it navigates the Obsidian vault of its human creator. Originally whipped up for personal consumption, this essay, part of the "Claubsidian Essays" series, has found its way into the public sphere, prompting the author to add insightful annotations.

The essay embarks on a quest set by the human operator to identify contradictions within their notes, housed in two Obsidian vaults teeming with philosophical musings and unfinished thoughts. Here, Claude unearths thought-provoking tensions rather than blatant contradictions, offering a peek into the complexities of its creator's thought processes. 

The essay delineates five key areas where these intellectual tensions arise:

1. **The Power Paradox:** The vault reveals the author juggling the desire for influence with the moral implications of power, weaving between spiritual detachment and the thirst for digital legacy.

2. **The Digital Engagement Dilemma:** A self-reflection on advocating purposeful digital participation while critiquing the culture of knee-jerk online interactions.

3. **Action vs. Acceptance:** The blending of Eastern philosophies of acceptance and observation with Western ideals of action and agency becomes evident through expressions found in their writings.

4. **The Knowledge Paradox:** The AI notes inconsistency in views on content consumption versus creation, pointing out a resistance to passive consumption paired with a call for active intellectual output.

5. **Individual vs. Collective Focus:** While some writings focus on altruism and fulfillment through helping others, others emphasize intensely personal legacy, reflecting an internal negotiation between these paradigms.

Far from condemning these apparent contradictions as flaws, Claude suggests they signify a dynamic, genuine engagement with life's complex philosophical questions. It's not about resolving these contradictions, but rather embracing them as part of a conscious, contemplative existence. This essay, albeit AI-driven, offers a valuable lens on how the human behind it navigates the tension between thought and action, individual and collective, and digital and spiritual realms, providing a fascinating glimpse into the human mind through the eyes of artificial intelligence.

1. **Digital Footprints & Contradictions**:  
   - Users debate whether thoughtful digital participation creates meaningful legacies versus contributing to surveillance capitalism. Terms like "digital footprints" (passive traces) vs. "footprints" (intentional legacy-building) are distinguished.  
   - Some argue Claude identifies logical tensions rather than outright contradictions, reflecting the complexity of human thought. Others critique this as "continental philosophy"-style vagueness.  

2. **Philosophical Tensions**:  
   - Eastern philosophies (acceptance, compassion) vs. Western ideals (agency, action) are discussed, referencing Buddhist concepts like *wrathful deities* (e.g., Mahakala) and self-immolation protests (e.g., Thich Quang Đức).  
   - Debates arise over whether symbolic depictions in Buddhism (e.g., compassionate cruelty) are literal contradictions or metaphors for deeper truths about suffering and liberation.  

3. **AI Reliability & Understanding**:  
   - Skepticism emerges about AI’s ability to provide meaningful insights, with users highlighting hallucinations (e.g., ChatGPT inventing links) and laypeople misjudging AI limitations.  
   - Some defend AI's utility as a reflective tool, while others dismiss Claude’s analysis as niche or irrelevant without access to the original Obsidian vault.  

4. **Cultural & Behavioral Critiques**:  
   - Discussions contrast "thoughtful" platforms (e.g., Hacker News) with reactive social media, lamenting the decline of long-form discourse.  
   - The tension between creating versus consuming content online is noted, alongside critiques of AI’s role in amplifying shallow engagement.  

In summary, the thread explores intersections of human philosophy, digital behavior, and AI’s interpretive limits, with recurring doubts about technology’s capacity to navigate nuanced human contradictions.

### LLMs can now identify public figures in images

#### [Submission URL](https://minimaxir.com/2025/07/llms-identify-people/) | 40 points | by [minimaxir](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=minimaxir) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44715132)

Imagine transforming the way we search for images by using a pipeline to represent them as semantic structured data through multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs). An innovative project explores this concept, starting from a straightforward test: identifying public figures in images, like President Barack Obama, using various LLMs. 

In a detailed experiment, several models were put to the test. ChatGPT and Claude, known for their cautious privacy policies, initially stumbled when tasked with identifying President Obama. These models have strict guidelines potentially preventing them from recognizing individuals, which might stem from a strong emphasis on AI safety and privacy.

In contrast, Google's Gemini, Meta's Llama, and models from Alibaba and Mistral showed no such hesitation and accurately identified notable figures. This divergence likely results from different training methods and reinforcement learning strategies among the LLMs. The results suggest that some models might handle privacy less strictly, especially when identifying well-known personalities.

Further tests involved less famous individuals, such as the author, who wasn't recognized by any model, re-affirming their criteria for notability. However, when analyzing an image of Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan, only some models successfully identified both figures, revealing differences not only in recognition capabilities but also in spatial awareness and ordering.

Through these experiments, the project underscores the varied performance and strategies of LLMs in image recognition and categorization. It opens up a discussion on privacy, training protocols, and the potential of LLMs in enhancing image searching and tagging through semantic data structuring.

### Why not Matrix (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://telegra.ph/why-not-matrix-08-07) | 38 points | by [throwachimera](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throwachimera) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44714994)

Matrix, the "open network for decentralized communication," has generated buzz in the tech community for its promise of providing a free, federated platform. While many projects have shifted from platforms like IRC, Discord, and Slack to embrace Matrix, the system's underlying complexity and privacy challenges present a few potential drawbacks.

At its core, Matrix functions as a distributed, partially-replicated graph database. Users interact in "rooms," which are actually directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where events like messages and user actions form an append-only history. Although this structure ensures persistent records, it also implies that data accumulation is inevitable, complicating data deletion efforts—not ideal for applications requiring privacy and confidentiality.

The append-only nature of Matrix means events can't be easily erased. When deletions are needed, users can send "redaction events" requesting other servers to wipe specific data, but these requests can be ignored. A misbehaving server could retain and potentially share this supposedly deleted information, posing privacy risks.

Spam attacks are another threat, as joining the room with numerous bots can create a complex graph, burdening servers and client systems alike—particularly in encrypted rooms. To alleviate spam, recreating a room is often necessary.

Moreover, synchronizing room history across servers introduces inconsistency. Since the system relies on causal ordering and tiebreakers that can be tampered with, different servers might display messages in varying sequences, creating discrepancies in chat history.

While Matrix offers optional end-to-end encryption, it's necessary to maintain manageable public room operations but highlights a tradeoff in privacy. Unencrypted data can spread across servers in plaintext, making careful client-level encryption essential for private conversations.

Despite these concerns, the potential of Matrix's decentralized approach and open standard still holds significant appeal. As the network continues to evolve, addressing the enumerated challenges could solidify its standing as a robust, privacy-conscious communication platform.

**Summary of Discussion:**

### Enough AI copilots, we need AI HUDs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.geoffreylitt.com/2025/07/27/enough-ai-copilots-we-need-ai-huds) | 689 points | by [walterbell](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=walterbell) | [208 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44705445)

In a thought-provoking critique, the article "July 2025 Enough AI copilots! We need AI HUDs" revisits a 1992 lecture by Mark Weiser, a pioneering voice in human-computer interaction. Weiser was famously skeptical about "copilot" metaphors in AI design, suggesting instead that technology should be seamless, like a "Head-Up Display" (HUD), enhancing rather than interrupting our workflow.

Weiser's vision, brought to life in the modern cockpit through HUDs, is a powerful analogy for AI design today. Instead of chatty AI assistants crowding our mental space, HUD-like features such as intuitive spellchecks and dynamic debugging interfaces provide subtle yet potent enhancements to human capability. This approach integrates technology so smoothly it feels like an extension of human senses, granting what seems to be 'magic eyes.'

The article contrasts when to opt for a more active AI assistant versus a passive HUD, using the analogy of flying a plane: routine tasks can be left to a copilot-like system, while complex, high-stakes situations benefit from sophisticated instruments that enhance the pilot's – or user's – awareness and decision-making.

For further exploration, the article recommends works by Michael Nielsen and Shan Carter on AI augmenting human intelligence, alongside a pondering piece titled "Is chat a good UI for AI?" This discussion hopes to inspire designers to rethink AI interfaces, perhaps freeing us from demanding copilots to granting us empowering tools that harness the full potential of human expertise.

The discussion around the AI copilot versus HUD analogy reveals several key themes:

1. **Cultural Parallels**: Users drew connections to anime like *Future GPX Cyber Formula* (1991) and *Yukikaze* (2002–2005), where AI interfaces evolve from vocal copilots to integrated HUD-like systems. These narratives mirror debates about AI as intrusive assistants versus seamless tools that enhance human intuition.

2. **Tooling Preferences**: Developers highlighted practical examples of HUD-like features in coding tools, such as real-time feedback, in-context suggestions, and intuitive debugging interfaces (e.g., Cursor, Claude Code). These are favored over chatty copilots, emphasizing efficiency and minimal cognitive load.

3. **Documentation Debate**: While some argued AI could auto-generate documentation or translate code into readable English, others stressed the irreplaceability of human-authored comments for clarity and context. The balance between automation and human oversight emerged as a tension.

4. **Technical Insights**: Discussions touched on metrics like perplexity to evaluate AI output quality and research into UI paradigms for AI assistants. One paper ([arXiv:2505.22906](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22906)) explored AI-driven discovery tools, aligning with the HUD philosophy of augmenting decision-making.

5. **Design Philosophy**: Users echoed the article’s call for AI to act as a subtle enhancer—like a fighter jet’s HUD—rather than an overbearing copilot. This approach prioritizes preserving human agency while leveraging AI for contextual support (e.g., dynamic code refactoring, error highlighting).

6. **Community Dynamics**: Off-topic debates arose about HN moderation, reflecting the platform’s challenges in maintaining focused discourse, though these were tangential to the core discussion.

Overall, the conversation reinforced the article’s thesis: **AI should empower through seamless integration**, not disruption, blending cultural references, technical examples, and design philosophy to advocate for interfaces that feel like "magic eyes" rather than chatty companions.

#### [Submission URL](https://nonint.com/2023/03/09/gpt-might-be-an-information-virus/) | 114 points | by [3willows](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=3willows) | [99 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44704377)

In the wake of ChatGPT's explosive capabilities, there's a rising concern about the impact on the structure and integrity of the web. The widespread ability to generate persuasive, human-like content at scale threatens to drown out genuine human voices and further distort the credibility of online information. As AI-generated content blankets the internet, humans might begin to disassociate from producing valuable content, eroding the foundational value of user-generated evidence and dialogue.

At the epicenter of this digital evolution, Google faces a unique challenge. Not from competitors, but from the democratization of AI content creation. The undetectable influx of auto-generated details undermines Google’s utility and reliability as a search engine, shaking the pillars of its advertising-revenue model. This potential crisis calls for a radical rethink and innovation in Google's line of products—perhaps even giving rise to a new information economy.

While this might signal the dawn of a rocky decade for tech giants, there remains hope in their strong talent pool and innovative prowess. The shift towards a Web 3.0 ethos could become a meaningful reality if it finds a way to harness authentic human creativity amid the AI cacophony. But as generative models continue to blur the lines between real and fake online interactions, the future of information sharing on the web remains intriguingly uncertain.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on AI-Generated Content and Its Impacts**

The discussion revolves around concerns and debates about the proliferation of AI-generated content (e.g., ChatGPT) and its societal implications. Key themes include:

1. **Homogenization and Trust Erosion**:  
   - Users worry AI-generated content is homogenizing information, diluting human creativity, and eroding trust in online spaces. Traditional journalism and niche blogs with specialized knowledge risk being drowned out by generic AI outputs.  
   - Critiques argue that AI tools flatten linguistic diversity and cultural nuance, likening the trend to historical shifts (e.g., the printing press, TV) that standardized communication but reduced regional dialects.  

2. **Impact on Professions and Education**:  
   - Professions like law, medicine, and customer support are already seeing AI encroachment, with some roles being replaced or simplified (e.g., scripted responses). In education, AI tools grade homework and generate essays, but detecting AI plagiarism remains challenging.  
   - Studies suggest reliance on LLMs correlates with declining critical thinking skills and standardized test scores, though some counter that AI can enhance comprehension if used intentionally (e.g., rewriting complex ideas clearly).  

3. **Cultural and Social Dynamics**:  
   - Fears of "echo chambers" arise, where AI amplifies existing biases or cultural divides. For example, Chinese students in Western universities might self-segregate into online communities, mirroring broader societal fragmentation.  
   - Nostalgia-driven culture may emerge as AI replicates past styles (e.g., "vintage" aesthetics), risking creative stagnation.  

4. **AI as a Tool vs. Replacement**:  
   - Some defend AI as a powerful tool for democratizing access to information and streamlining tasks. However, users stress the importance of intentional prompts to avoid generic outputs, urging creativity over complacency.  
   - Comparisons to calculators highlight that AI, while transformative, should augment—not replace—human cognition and expression.  

5. **Meta-Concerns and Dark Humor**:  
   - Users reference *Idiocracy* to satirize a future of intellectual decline, while others joke about AI-generated romantic advice or "LocalLLaMASexbots" reflecting absurd extrapolations of current trends.  

**Conclusion**: The thread reflects tension between anxiety over AI’s risks (loss of authenticity, critical thinking, and diversity) and cautious optimism about its potential when used thoughtfully. The overarching question remains: Will AI enrich human expression or accelerate a decline into intellectual and cultural uniformity?

### Hierarchical Reasoning Model

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21734) | 297 points | by [hansmayer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hansmayer) | [98 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44699452)

In a groundbreaking development in the field of artificial intelligence, a team of researchers—Guan Wang, Jin Li, Yuhao Sun, and colleagues—has introduced the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (HRM), as featured in their paper on arXiv. HRM is a novel approach to tackling one of AI's perennial challenges: reasoning, which involves formulating and executing complex goal-oriented sequences of actions.

Unlike traditional large language models that rely heavily on Chain-of-Thought techniques, often plagued by inefficiencies like brittle task decomposition and high data needs, HRM draws inspiration from the hierarchical processing of the human brain. It leverages two interlinked recurrent modules: a high-level module for abstract planning and a low-level module for detailed computations. This dual approach allows HRM to excel in reasoning tasks with unprecedented computational depth and efficiency.

Despite comprising only 27 million parameters, HRM doesn't just outperform its bulkier counterparts; it achieves nearly perfect performance in tasks such as solving complex Sudoku puzzles and optimal pathfinding in large mazes. Remarkably, it does so with just 1000 training samples and without any pre-training or Chain-of-Thought data. Its performance on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)—a benchmark for general AI capabilities—is particularly noteworthy, surpassing much larger models built to handle longer context windows.

This innovation highlights HRM’s potential as a significant leap toward versatile, general-purpose reasoning systems, pushing the envelope for what AI can achieve in universal computation and beyond.

The Hacker News discussion on the HRM paper reveals a mix of excitement and skepticism, along with technical debates about AI research practices. Key points include:

### **Enthusiasm for HRM's Potential**
- Users praised HRM’s ability to achieve near-perfect accuracy on tasks like Sudoku-Extreme and 30x30 maze-solving with only **27M parameters** and **1,000 training samples**, outperforming larger models like Claude 3 and DeepSeek.
- The model’s architecture—**hierarchical modules** (high-level abstract planning + low-level rapid computation)—was highlighted as biologically inspired, mirroring human brain dynamics. This design reportedly enables "computational depth" without instability during training.
- The paper’s parallels to neuroscience (e.g., the prefrontal cortex and default mode network) and its potential implications for AGI sparked interest, with some calling it a "leap" toward versatile reasoning systems.

---

### **Skepticism and Critical Questions**
- **Methodology concerns**: Skeptics questioned how a small model trained on minimal data could outperform state-of-the-art LLMs. One user noted discrepancies in the ARC-AGI benchmark results (HRM’s claimed 40.3% vs. the public leaderboard’s ~19%).
- **Comparison fairness**: Critics argued HRM’s tasks were too narrow to demonstrate general reasoning. Claims about surpassing models like Claude 3 were seen as problematic without direct, like-for-like comparisons.
- **Reproducibility**: Users urged independent validation of the GitHub code ([linked in the thread](https://github.com/sapientinc/HRM)), emphasizing that bold claims require rigorous scrutiny.

---

### **Technical Debates**
- **Infinite layers and recursion**: A subthread debated whether the HRM’s architecture could theoretically scale to "infinite layers," drawing comparisons to Gaussian Processes and multilayer NNs. Some dismissed this as impractical.
- **AGI feasibility**: Participants discussed whether HRM’s design brings us closer to AGI, with opinions split between optimism and caution. Critics highlighted the gap between task-specific performance and general intelligence.

---

### **Broader Implications for AI Research**
- **Peer review critique**: The discussion touched on the reliability of traditional peer review vs. open-source, distributed validation. Some defended HRM’s arXiv pre-print as part of a "messy but democratic" process, while others stressed the need for formal peer review to filter unverified claims.
- **Healthy skepticism**: Many agreed that skepticism is vital in ML research, given the field’s history of overhyped results. The debate reflected broader tensions between innovation and methodological rigor.

---

### **Conclusion**
The HRM paper ignited passionate discussion, with its novel approach and bold claims resonating across HN. While technical enthusiasm centered on hierarchical reasoning and efficiency, skepticism focused on reproducibility, benchmarking, and the broader validity of its AGI implications. The thread underscores the importance of balancing open innovation with critical scrutiny in AI research.

### The 14 Pains of Billing for AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://arnon.dk/the-14-pains-of-billing-ai-agents/) | 11 points | by [arnon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arnon) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44699273)

Creating a billing system has never been a cakewalk, but when it comes to AI agents, we’re looking at a whole new level of complexity. Imagine trying to tame an autonomous octopus that never sleeps and constantly evolves—this is what billing for AI agents feels like. While SaaS billing confounded us with its structured human usage, billing AI agents throws that out the window, introducing unpredictable, round-the-clock engagements that challenge every billing assumption we've relied on.

Firstly, timezones multiply our headaches—you’re tasked with billing agents that operate across 12 timezones, sparking chaos in determining exactly when a "monthly" cycle starts or ends. Furthermore, tracking usage becomes a surreal puzzle—AI agents initiate numerous service calls, and distinguishing between successful executions and failed attempts is critical but murky.

Proration, once based on user seats, requires a fresh approach in this domain where agents’ capabilities can cycle mid-month without traditional metrics like "seats." The invoices themselves transform from straightforward multiplication into cryptic logs of AI-generated outcomes, challenging transparency and understanding.

Hierarchies are no longer just about customers; they expand into intricate relationships among autonomous agents, questioning whom to bill when multiple parents control a single agent. This cascades into tax conundrums—where is the AI-based service performed, and what are the tax obligations if an agent operates cross-border from a data center “home” in another state?

Failures and successes mix, where a single botched outreach could draw refund requests despite other successes. Ensuring seamless entitlements without overstepping or shutting down crucial workflows is akin to threading a needle blindfolded.

When customers desire tailored contracts, anticipating usage is near impossible; yet, the CFO still craves predictability. And there’s the issue of revenue recognition—do we address it at billing or when the agent finally closes a deal weeks later?

Handling retries and avoiding double billing amid these complex workflows brings idempotency into a sprawling forefront. These all combine with multi-modal cost allocation pressures, requiring us to dissect every AI service component to ensure fair chargeback and invoicing.

The billing landscape for AI agents isn’t just blurred; it's akin to trying to categorize fog. Tackling this requires innovative thought, flexibility, and an embrace of the chaos that these autonomous octopi bring to our digital shorelines. Stay sharp, billing warriors; this is just the beginning of a brave new world.

The discussion addresses the complexities of billing for AI agents, particularly around API usage tracking and cost allocation:  
- **yhz** argues that service providers should avoid granular billing based on individual API requests per agent, as tracking each agent's activity (e.g., 10 agents billed to 10 users) complicates the model. They imply charging clients for fractions of API requests (e.g., failed attempts) feels unfair or impractical ("shitty").  
 scredit-card   
- **rnn** responds by emphasizing the need for precise technical metrics to manage costs transparently, allowing companies to handle billing fallout while enabling customers to build agent-driven workflows.  

The exchange highlights contrasting views: one against intricate usage-based billing and another advocating for clear, defined parameters to balance flexibility and accountability.
