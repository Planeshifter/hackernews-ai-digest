### **1. LLMs as Knowledge Compressors**  
- Users highlight the **remarkable compression efficiency** of LLMs. A 81GB model like Gemma312B, when downloaded via Ollama, can encapsulate vast human knowledge while enabling practical applications (e.g., answering trivia questions).  
- **Analogies to traditional compression** (JPEG, MP3) emerge, with [slfmschf](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=slfmschf) noting that LLMs perform "semantic compression," leveraging relationships and meaning rather than raw data patterns. Tools like Fabrice Bellard’s [ts_zip](https://bellard.org/ts_zip/), which uses LLMs for text compression, are cited as innovations.  

### **2. Debates on Intelligence and Compression**  
- **Is intelligence just compression?** Some argue that reasoning and prediction in LLMs mirror compression principles, while others distinguish between "fluid intelligence" (problem-solving) and "crystallized intelligence" (stored knowledge). References to Douglas Hofstadter’s work on analogy and cognition add depth to this debate.  
- [Nevermark](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Nevermark) suggests that LLMs’ short-term working memory and rapid summarization hint at "vaster intelligence" beyond simple compression. Others counter that their logical reasoning remains limited despite large context windows.  

### **3. Data Sources and Practical Limits**  
- **Wikipedia’s role** is dissected: The English Wikipedia’s 25GB compressed size (vs. LLMs’ 81GB) sparks discussion on how models internalize knowledge. [crzygrng](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=crzygrng) notes that while much LLM knowledge is derived from Wikipedia, the models extend beyond it through broader training.  
- Offline tools like [Kiwix](https://kiwix.org/) are praised for providing reliable, pre-loaded datasets, contrasting with LLMs’ "lossy" but dynamic knowledge synthesis.  

### **4. Technical and Ethical Considerations**  
- **Model efficiency** improvements (e.g., Mixture-of-Experts architectures) democratize access but raise concerns about energy use and computational costs.  
- Skepticism lingers around corporate transparency, such as Meta’s "misleading practices" around Llama-4, underscoring ethical responsibilities in AI development.  

### **5. Nostalgia and Future Outlook**  
- Humorous comparisons to "storing the internet on floppy disks" ([dgrbl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dgrbl)) evoke nostalgia, while predictions about 2025-era hardware (M3 Ultra Mac Studio) highlight rapid progress.  
- Developers like [exe34](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=exe34) marvel at LLMs’ ability to generate code from plain English instructions, signaling a shift in how humans interact with technology.  

**Conclusion**: The conversation blends technical fascination with philosophical inquiry, debating whether LLMs represent true intelligence or sophisticated compression—while acknowledging their transformative potential and ethical complexities.

In a late-night burst of creativity, an intriguing terminal-based web browser named Spegel was born. This proof-of-concept tool is not your typical browser; instead, it relies on the power of large language models (LLMs) to transform web content by feeding HTML through an LLM and rendering it as markdown in your terminal.

Spegel, inspired by the Swedish word for "mirror", allows users to personalize their web viewing experience using custom prompts. Imagine being able to switch between different views of a webpage, such as simplifying content down to an "Explain Like I'm 5" (ELI5) level or highlighting just the crucial bits of a recipe. This personalization is achieved through configurations in a TOML file, where users can define their own prompts and views.

The browser's simplicity comes from its functionality: no JavaScript and only GET requests, making it light yet efficient. With support from Google's newly like Gemini 2.5 Pro Lite model, Spegel is about processing web content faster and more economically compared to traditional methods. This new browser demonstrates how LLMs can enhance online experiences by tailoring content to individual preferences in real-time, making previously expensive and slow transformations quick and accessible.

Spegel allows users to focus on what matters by stripping away unnecessary noise like CSS and JavaScript, particularly on terminals with limited display space. While it doesn't aim to replace conventional terminal browsers like Lynx or modernly styled ones like Browsh, it provides a unique dadaist exploration into potential future applications of LLMs in everyday tech usage.

Spegel's code and its potential for community-driven growth are available on GitHub. If you're up for trying something new and experimental, install Spegel via pip and configure your browsing setup in `~/.spegel.toml`. The project is still rough around the edges but promises an intriguing direction for those keen on blending terminal usability with AI-driven personalization. Explore more at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/simedw/spegel) to get involved or just play around with this novel browser yourself!

Think of it as a clever sandbox strategy, akin to the video game Factorio, where efficiency compounding is achieved through self-improving AI agents.

Here's how the workflow unfolds:

1. **Planning**: Tasks are outlined using Claude code alongside an agent called o3 to generate a thorough implementation blueprint. The result is documented in detail to ensure the plan's success from the start.

2. **Execution**: AI agents, Sonnet 3.7 and 4, execute these plans, with Sonnet 4 often deployed for tasks requiring precision in Clojure syntax. Importantly, all changes are committed incrementally, allowing for easy reversions if needed.

3. **Verification and Feedback**: Post-execution, Sonnet 4 and o3 rigorously verify the code against initial plans, eliminating incompatible code or lint ignores as suggested by Claude. Any issues identified are incorporated into the planning phase, thus enhancing future projects.

One intriguing facet is the development of bespoke agent 'factories' for specific tasks, such as adhering to local coding styles or optimizing workflows. This modular approach allows for layering simple agent tasks into more complex operations, including API integrations and automated documentation.

The philosophy here is maximizing the utility of AI agent interactions via iteration. Multiple attempts are encouraged, with learnings from failures feeding back into input adjustments. This loop transforms a set of disposable outputs into a robust system of compounding capabilities.

Looking forward, the author plans to refine agent coordination, align more closely with business objectives, build increasingly complex workflows, and optimize token usage across platforms.

In summary, this narrative isn't just about code generation; it illustrates a forward-thinking application of AI that treats agents as collaborative partners. It's an inspiring call to see beyond traditional coding to more adaptive, iterative development processes.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion:

### Key Themes of the Debate  
1. **Trivial vs. Non-Trivial AI Use Cases**  
   - Critics argue many examples labeled "non-trivial" (e.g., fixing Clojure indentation) are actually trivial. True non-trivial tasks (e.g., debugging complex systems like Mandelbrot generators in assembly, revising LLVM optimizations) demand weeks of specialized human expertise and iterative refinement.  
   - Pushback: LLMs excel at incremental "shallow" tasks (pattern matching, boilerplate code) but struggle with deeply context-dependent, creative problems or systems requiring domain-specific intuition.  

2. **Real-World Applications**  
   - Success stories:  
     - Upgrading React versions by combining LLMs with search tools ([example](httpssimonwillisonnet2025Apr21ai-ssstd-srch#l)).  
     - Assisting in **reverse-engineering code**, shortening implementation time by extracting insights from documentation.  
   - Failures:  
     - Open-source contributions (e.g., React chart libraries) often produce unreliable code without deep system understanding.  
     - Cloudflare’s AI-assisted OAuth implementation led to security flaws despite rigorous review ([CVE-2025-4143](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-4pc9-x2fx-p7vj)).  

3. **Impact on Engineering Jobs**  
   - Some argue LLMs streamline workflows, making engineers "10x faster/cheaper." Others counter that automating shallow tasks shifts focus to harder problems (e.g., compliance, architecture) *without* reducing the need for skilled developers.  

4. **Limitations of Benchmarks**  
   - Skepticism toward AI "puzzles" (e.g., Apple’s reasoning paper) as indicators of real-world coding skill. LLMs often fail when problems exceed training data or require novel reasoning.  

5. **Education Concerns**  
   - Teaching CS students to rely on LLMs risks stunting foundational skills (e.g., assembly/architecture knowledge).  

### Illustrative Quotes  
- **“Non-trivial”:** *“Things that take specialists and skill lists months to create.”* – Defining tasks requiring human depth.  
- **Code Contributions:** *“Adding significant value to open-source projects isn’t ‘pretty trivial.’”* – Highlighting gaps in AI’s understanding.  

### Final Takeaway  
While LLMs excel at narrow, repetitive tasks (code formatting, boilerplate), their role in complex engineering remains debated. Critics emphasize human oversight is irreplaceable for system-level thinking, while proponents see AI as augmenting productivity within clear boundaries.

Hey tech enthusiasts! Today on Hacker News, we've got something that will likely pique the interest of anyone diving deep into the world of large language models (LLMs). Enter C.O.R.E., the Contextual Observation & Recall Engine, a personal and fully portable memory layer for LLMs. With 238 stars already, it’s gaining traction for how it promises to revolutionize memory management for AI applications.

C.O.R.E. is no ordinary memory system—it's designed to provide users with complete ownership of a dynamic and living knowledge graph that’s private and portable. Whether you're running it locally or using the cloud-hosted version, C.O.R.E. stands out by organizing memories as interconnected, traceable “Statements” that evolve over time. It captures who said what, when it happened, and why it matters, unlike the static "sticky notes" many systems use.

This powerhouse of a tool could be a game-changer for compliance and auditing. For example, asking for changes in pricing since Q1 allows you to track approvals and contexts like meetings and emails, providing unparalleled transparency and traceability. The tool also offers integrations with others, such as Cursor, allowing users to connect their own memory repository across various platforms.

For those eager to get their hands dirty, setting up C.O.R.E. locally involves Docker, OpenAI’s API, and some command-line magic. The GitHub repo offers detailed steps, including how to create your private knowledge space and add memories. You'll also learn to programmatically interact with C.O.R.E. via APIs for more advanced use cases.

Still in progress is improved compatibility with Llama-based models, but updates are on the horizon. Dive into their demo video for a closer look and see for yourself how C.O.R.E. might just become your go-to tool for enhancing AI memory capabilities!

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion around **C.O.R.E.** highlights both enthusiasm for its novel approach to LLM memory management and debates over its design choices. Key themes include:

1. **Graph-Based vs. Text-Based Memory**:  
   - Supporters praise CORE’s dynamic knowledge graph for enabling relational, temporal, and transparent memory retrieval, surpassing static text files. Critics argue simpler systems (e.g., Markdown + Git) may suffice for basic needs, though proponents counter that CORE excels at complex queries like tracking timeline-based changes or resolving contradictions.  

2. **Integration & Compatibility**:  
   - Users inquire about compatibility with models like **Claude** and **Llama**. Contributors note ongoing work to expand support beyond OpenAI, with mentions of local setups using vLLM or LMStudio.  

3. **Memory Challenges**:  
   - Discussants highlight hurdles like balancing context constraints with recall depth, avoiding "overwhelm" from irrelevant data, and ensuring traceability. CORE’s structured approach—using temporal tracking, explicit inclusion/exclusion of statements, and graph-based retrieval—is seen as addressing these issues.  

4. **Comparisons to Alternatives**:  
   - Comparisons to tools like **Zep** focus on CORE’s portability (cloud/desktop support), individual-first design, and “reified” temporal graphs that track *why* changes occur, not just *when*.  

5. **Semantic Web Debate**:  
   - Some question whether explicit semantic triples (RDF-style) are necessary, given LLMs’ ability to infer relationships. CORE’s team argues explicit structuring aids efficient retrieval and contradiction detection, though others prefer lightweight methods like Markdown.  

6. **Trade-offs**:  
   - While CORE’s complexity adds overhead, users acknowledge its value for compliance, auditing, and use cases requiring relational context (e.g., healthcare or pricing changes). Simpler systems may suffice for basic recall.  

**Final Takeaway**: The community views CORE as a promising step toward adaptable, explainable AI memory systems, though adoption may hinge on balancing its power with usability and broader model compatibility. Developers debating integration will weigh its structured, transparent approach against their specific needs for simplicity versus depth.

### Claude Code now supports hooks

#### [Submission URL](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks) | 371 points | by [ramoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ramoz) | [161 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44429225)

Anthropic has rolled out a comprehensive guide on using "Claude Code" hooks on their platform. The new functionality allows developers to define shell commands, known as hooks, that execute at certain points in Claude Code’s lifecycle, providing deterministic control over its behavior. This enables users to automate notifications, format code automatically, enforce logging standards, give feedback on coding conventions, and set up custom permissions. It essentially turns what would have been LLM suggestions into reliable app-level commands that execute without user confirmation.

To get started, developers need to configure their settings files and can set up hooks to, for example, log all shell commands executed by Claude Code using tools like jq for JSON processing. The hooks, which execute with full user permissions, need to be handled with care to prevent security issues, as users are responsible for their safe use.

For practical implementation, Anthropic provides a quickstart guide detailing how to configure these hooks—complete with setting up matchers for specific tool calls, logging commands, and verifying configurations. This tool promises a more structured and predictable interaction with Claude Code, empowering developers to enforce consistent workflows and improve automation within their development environments. However, Anthropic underscores the importance of reviewing security considerations to avoid possible data loss or system damage.

The discussion around Anthropic's Claude Code hooks reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Craftsmanship vs. Automation**:  
   - Many users express concern that AI tools like Claude Code might erode software craftsmanship, drawing parallels to digital art and photography, where automation increased output but diluted traditional skills. Critics argue AI-generated code could lead to brittle, hard-to-debug systems, likening it to "sloppy" early digital art or hastily assembled plumbing.  
   - Others counter that AI democratizes access to powerful tools, enabling faster development while still requiring human oversight for quality.

2. **Impact on Jobs and Industry**:  
   - Fears arise that AI could eliminate coding jobs, similar to how tractors reduced agricultural labor. However, some note that demand for software often grows to absorb productivity gains.  
   - A subset predicts disruption for SaaS companies, as cheaper AI tools might replace expensive subscriptions, favoring custom solutions over bloated enterprise software.

3. **Transitional Shifts**:  
   - Commentators liken the current AI wave to historical shifts (e.g., Winamp → streaming, Photoshop → digital art tools), acknowledging a messy transition period where old and new paradigms clash. Some foresee a "Cambrian explosion" of niche tools but warn of fragmentation and complexity.

4. **Security and Responsibility**:  
   - Warnings emerge about the risks of powerful hooks, with references to *Jurassic Park* cautioning against uncontrolled permissions. Users stress that AI tools, while convenient, could introduce security flaws if misconfigured or over-relied upon.

5. **Quality and Maintenance**:  
   - Skepticism abounds regarding AI's ability to handle edge cases, with anecdotes about brittle Excel-based systems and hallucinations in code generation. Some lament a decline in "hand-crafted" software reliability compared to older, simpler tools.

6. **Economic and Cultural Tensions**:  
   - Debates highlight divides between efficiency-driven automation and artisanal values, with some users mourning the loss of pride in craftsmanship, while others embrace AI's potential to reduce drudgery.

In summary, the discussion reflects both optimism about AI's democratizing potential and deep anxiety about its impact on quality, jobs, and the soul of software development. The community grapples with balancing automation's efficiency against the irreplaceable nuance of human expertise.

### Cloudflare to introduce pay-per-crawl for AI bots

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-pay-per-crawl/) | 531 points | by [scotchmi_st](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=scotchmi_st) | [283 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44432385)

In a world where digital content is in high demand but often consumed without compensation, Cloudflare is pioneering a new approach: "pay per crawl." Unveiled as a private beta, this innovative service gives content creators the power to charge AI crawlers for accessing their material, effectively enabling monetization at an internet-wide scale. Traditionally, creators faced a tough choice: allow free, unfettered access to their content or block out all automated traffic. Cloudflare's solution offers a welcome third alternative, allowing creators to dictate terms on who, how, and when their content is accessed.

Here's how it works: the system hinges on the seldom-used HTTP response code 402, "Payment Required." Through predefined rules, publishers can demand payment from AI crawlers wishing to access their sites. They can set a standard fee per request and then opt to allow, charge, or block any crawler accordingly. Cloudflare takes care of the technical aspects, acting as a merchant of record.

Significantly, this setup assures content owners remain in control. They can choose to charge certain crawlers while granting others free access, or negotiate bespoke deals outside the system. Integration with existing security measures ensures offerings align seamlessly with security protocols.

For AI crawlers, staying compliant involves authenticating requests via HTTPS message signatures, backed by Ed25519 key pairs. They can detect when payment is needed and decide if they wish to proceed at the presented cost, or, conversely, signal preferred rates upfront.

Ultimately, "pay per crawl" empowers publishers to monetize AI's curiosity, potentially enriching both content owners and the web itself by incentivizing curated access to high-quality digital resources.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the practical challenges and philosophical debates surrounding microtransactions vs. subscription models for content monetization. Key points include:

1. **Microtransaction Fatigue:** Users argue that requiring frequent, small payments for individual content (e.g., articles, videos) creates mental overhead and decision fatigue. The repeated need to decide "Is this worth paying for?" exhausts consumers, making bundling (e.g., Spotify, YouTube Premium) more appealing despite middleman fees.

2. **Bundling Pros/Cons:** Subscription models are praised for simplifying access with flat fees but criticized for fragmenting content across platforms and disconnecting creators from direct revenue (e.g., streaming services’ opaque payouts). Some suggest "content credits" tied to usage, allowing users to allocate a monthly budget proportionally to consumed content.

3. **Trust and Middlemen:** Concerns arise about centralized intermediaries (e.g., Cloudflare, Coinbase’s x402 project) replicating existing problems (corruption, opaque revenue splits). Critics argue distributed systems (e.g., BitTorrent-like credit mechanisms) could bypass middlemen, but trust and enforcement remain hurdles.

4. **Technical Feasibility:** Some note that microtransactions might work best for negligibly low costs (e.g., fractions of a cent per AI query), minimizing decision friction. Others cite Flattr 2.0 as a prior attempt at usage-based revenue sharing.

5. **User Behavior:** Participants debate whether flat fees or credits align with human habits—flat fees offer simplicity but incentivize overconsumption, while credit systems risk complicating budgeting (e.g., "Should I watch a $10 movie or read articles this month?").

6. **Alternative Models:** Ideas like time-based payments ("Donate 60 minutes/month to creators") or decentralized trust networks emerge, but face skepticism over implementation. Existing platforms (YouTube, Spotify) are seen as imperfect compromises balancing creator revenue and user convenience.

In essence, the conversation highlights a tension: while microtransactions offer granular fairness, their psychological and logistical costs clash with the simplicity of subscriptions—yet both struggle to ensure equitable compensation and user satisfaction without centralized intermediaries.

### Small language models are the future of agentic AI

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02153) | 110 points | by [favoboa](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=favoboa) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44430311)

A recent paper submitted to arXiv is stirring up the AI community by suggesting that Small Language Models (SLMs) might be the keystone for the future of agentic AI. Authored by Peter Belcak and his team, the paper argues that while Large Language Models (LLMs) have been celebrated for their versatile capabilities and human-like conversational prowess, there’s a growing realm of applications where their massive scale isn't just unnecessary but economically inefficient.

According to the authors, many agentic AI systems—those which carry out repetitive, specialized tasks—can operate effectively with SLMs. These smaller models deliver adequate performance, tailored suitability, and economic advantages, presenting them as a viable alternative for specialized tasks. The paper sheds light on SLMs as the next frontier, advocating for their use in contexts where a few specialized tasks are repeated with minimal variation.

The authors also introduce the concept of heterogeneous agentic systems, which combine multiple models, as an optimal approach for tasks demanding conversational capabilities. They address potential barriers to the adoption of SLMs, propose an LLM-to-SLM conversion algorithm, and call for the AI community to debate and contribute further to this pivotal shift.

This paper is a significant contribution to the ongoing discussion about AI resource optimization and cost reduction, highlighting the strategic shift from large-scale to more focused AI applications. It sets the stage for realignment in how we perceive and deploy AI models, urging for a balance between operational demands and economic efficiency in the AI industry.

The discussion around using Small Language Models (SLMs) versus Large Language Models (LLMs) for agentic AI reflects practical frustrations and diverse opinions:

1. **Criticism of Current AI Implementations**:  
   Users shared exasperating experiences with LLM-driven customer service, such as Amazon’s refund process and Air Canada’s chatbot mistakenly promising discounts. These examples highlight failures where LLMs produced nonsensical replies, inefficient workflows, or legal risks, undermining trust in their reliability.

2. **Advocacy for Simpler Solutions**:  
   Some argued that **deterministic workflows** (via traditional NLP or rule-based systems) or narrowly scoped SLMs might outperform LLMs for repetitive tasks like refund processing. The reasoning: LLMs are overkill for structured, predictable tasks and introduce unnecessary complexity/costs. As one user put it, *“Why burn crazy amounts of tokens hoping it works 80% of the time when simpler, cheaper methods work 100% of the time?”*

3. **Corporate Cost-Cutting Concerns**:  
   Commenters criticized companies for opting for poorly implemented AI (e.g., Doordash, Lyft) to reduce expenses, resulting in worse customer experiences. Executives were accused of prioritizing cost savings over thoughtful design, leading to “enshittification” of support systems.

4. **Legal and Accountability Challenges**:  
   The Air Canada case sparked debate about holding companies liable for LLM errors. Critics noted corporations often deflect blame onto “chatbot hallucinations,” raising questions about legal frameworks and enforcement in the AI era.

5. **Hardware and Economic Pressures**:  
   NVIDIA’s dominance in AI hardware was cited as a factor pushing LLM adoption, potentially at the expense of SLM development. Some worry economic incentives (e.g., selling GPU clusters) may skew research priorities away from efficient, specialized models.

6. **Balancing Versatility vs. Specialization**:  
   While LLMs excel in versatility and general reasoning, many agreed that **heterogeneous systems** (mixing SLMs/LLMs) or task-specific models could optimize performance and cost. As one user noted, *“SLMs aren’t replacing LLMs—they’re complementary for specialized tasks.”*

**Consensus**: The community largely supports exploring SLMs for narrow, deterministic workflows (e.g., refunds, customer service) where LLMs’ flexibility is unnecessary. However, skepticism remains about corporate execution and over-reliance on LLMs as a panacea. The call is for pragmatic, context-aware AI design—not just scaling models indiscriminately.
