### A float walks into a gradual type system

#### [Submission URL](https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2025/a-float-walks-into-a-gradual-type-system) | 23 points | by [ruuda](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ruuda) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43239111)

**Introducing RCL: A New Configuration Language for Enhanced JSON Utility**

In the world of configuration files, where JSON, YAML, and TOML reign supreme, a fresh contender enters the fray: RCL, a gradually typed superset of JSON designed to boost abstraction and reuse while maintaining a simple, functional flair. Think of RCL as a blend of JSON's straightforwardness and the functional capabilities you'd find in tools like jq, sans the hassle of consulting a large language model for query crafting.

**The Float Dilemma**

RCL's journey to becoming a comprehensive JSON superset encountered a bump with number representation. While integers were in the bag early on, introducing floats—numbers with decimal points—posed a considerable challenge due to conflicting design principles. JSON itself leaves number semantics open to interpretation, leading to varied treatments across languages like Python and JavaScript.

The main hurdle? Ensuring RCL could generate compatible configurations across different systems without blurring the line between integers and floats. Silent conversions—adding or stripping decimal points—were off the table to keep configurations precise and reliable.

**Types and Trade-offs**

RCL's gradual type system aims to curb bugs and enhance code clarity by distinguishing between ints and floats. However, this seemingly simple distinction opens up a can of worms. How much should be modeled in the type system? Should there be unsigned integers, different integer sizes, or even refined types?

Developer musings led RCL's creator to reconsider the necessity of such distinctions, weighing the benefits against complexity costs. The objective remains clear: RCL should stay intuitive and predictable.

**Wishlist vs. Reality**

The wish for a separate integer type in RCL comes with implications:

1. **Distinct Int and Float Types**: Valuable for operations and config schemas that differentiate between the two.
2. **Universal Comparability**: Ensures equality checks across values, crucial for heterogeneous lists akin to JSON.
3. **Referential Transparency**: Substitutable values should yield consistent results, a cornerstone of simplicity and ease of reasoning.

However, a clash arises when attempting to marry these principles with type separation. If 1 is numerically different from 1.0, yet both are equal, how do we handle assignments across int and float types without chaos?

**Navigating the Path Forward**

RCL could abandon the separate integer type, merging all numbers into a singular "Number" type. This would align with some programming languages, streamlining operations at the potential cost of nuance in specific contexts.

Ultimately, RCL is shaped by a commitment to being "simple and boring"—a practical tool that developers can quickly grasp and utilize without fuss. This dedication means making tough choices, ensuring that RCL remains intuitive while providing the utility developers expect from a modern configuration language. 

RCL is not about reinventing the wheel but refining it, offering a cohesive balance that respects familiar programming paradigms while expanding JSON's capabilities. As RCL evolves, its guiding principle remains clear: empower, don't overcomplexify.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around RCL's handling of integers vs. floats revolves around practical challenges, edge cases, and philosophical debates about type systems:

1. **Equality and Precision Issues**:  
   Users highlight problems with comparing integers and floats (e.g., `1 == 1.0`), noting that float comparisons are inherently unreliable due to precision limits (e.g., `0.1 + 0.1 != 0.2`). Edge cases like `NaN`, `-0`, and `±Infinity` further complicate equality checks and type semantics.

2. **Ambiguity in Representation**:  
   Concerns arise about how RCL might handle numeric representations across systems. For example, JSON’s lack of precision specifications can lead to confusion (e.g., `13.0` vs. `13`), and allowing excessive zeros (e.g., `14+` decimal places) risks ambiguity in underlying values.

3. **Type System Semantics**:  
   Debate centers on whether distinct `Int`/`Float` types are worth the complexity. Some argue that strict type separation could break referential transparency (e.g., substituting `1` with `1.0` might fail in certain contexts). Others suggest decomposing numeric values during comparisons or assignments to reconcile type differences.

4. **Practical Use Cases**:  
   Floats as list indexes (e.g., `0.5`) are criticized for being invalid in many contexts, requiring runtime checks. While RCL might allow this flexibility, users warn that float imprecision could lead to unexpected behavior (e.g., in loops or mathematical operations).

5. **Simplicity vs. Nuance**:  
   The community questions whether RCL should adopt a unified `Number` type (simpler but less precise) or enforce strict type distinctions (complex but clearer). The trade-off between developer intuition and technical precision remains unresolved.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores the tension between RCL’s goal of simplicity and the inherent complexity of numeric type systems. Developers emphasize the need for clear semantics around floats, edge cases, and practical usability to avoid pitfalls seen in JSON and other languages.

In a riveting discussion on Simon Willison's Weblog, the complexities and misunderstandings surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) in coding are laid bare. A common grievance among developers using LLMs is the occurrence of "hallucinations," where the model fabricates methods or libraries that aren't real. While this might initially erode trust, Simon argues that these hallucinations are the least harmful type of errors one can encounter. The beauty of coding is that any invented methods are immediately spotlighted by compilers or interpreters, offering a simple fix path: either self-correct or let the LLM iterate on the error.

The real peril lies in errors that don't immediately show up, prompting the need for rigorous testing. Even seemingly flawless code can harbor hidden flaws. The antidote? A robust regimen of manual testing and code review—skills that won't be axed by the rise of LLMs.

For developers inundated with hallucinations, Willison suggests leveraging different models with better-aligned training data, harnessing the full potential of context windows, and choosing established technologies that LLMs are more familiar with.

Simon encourages developers to embrace the LLM learning curve, noting the importance of honing skills in reading and reviewing code efficiently. He also shares how he uses Claude’s “extended thinking mode” for constructive feedback on his work, demonstrating a harmonious blend of AI and human expertise.

This discourse not only mitigates fears surrounding LLM coding errors but also champions a proactive, informed approach to integrating AI into software development. Whether you’re a seasoned developer or an AI novice, there’s food for thought—and skills to sharpen—in this insightful reflection.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges and nuances of integrating LLMs into coding workflows, particularly focusing on code reviews, productivity trade-offs, and broader implications. Key points include:

1. **Code Review Challenges**:  
   - Reviewing LLM-generated code is seen as fundamentally different from human-written code. While human code allows for social/technical knowledge transfer, LLM code lacks "empathy" and contextual decision-making, making reviews feel like negotiating with an opaque system.  
   - Skepticism exists about trusting LLM outputs, especially in unfamiliar domains, as models may generate plausible-looking but incorrect code (e.g., inventing methods or misaligning with project architecture).  

2. **Productivity vs. Maintenance**:  
   - Some users report LLMs boosting productivity (e.g., 20-30% faster coding) but note hidden costs in debugging and maintaining generated code.  
   - Over-reliance on LLMs risks creating codebases that are hard to understand without thorough documentation, tests, and conventions.  

3. **Testing and Constraints**:  
   - Logical flaws in LLM-generated code are harder to catch than syntax errors, emphasizing the need for rigorous testing, static analysis, and design constraints.  
   - Comparisons are drawn to Stack Overflow answers—incorrect solutions can gain traction if not critically reviewed.  

4. **Legal and Cultural Concerns**:  
   - LLMs might deliberately avoid certain outputs (e.g., song lyrics) due to copyright fears, leading to unhelpful or evasive responses.  
   - Debates arise about AI’s role in writing styles, with some arguing AI-assisted editing improves clarity, while others worry it erodes authenticity or cultural nuance.  

5. **Human Expertise Remains Critical**:  
   - Participants stress that understanding design intent, maintaining codebase consistency, and strategic decision-making still require human oversight. Tools like Claude’s "extended thinking mode" are praised for feedback but not replacements for deep comprehension.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects cautious optimism about LLMs as productivity aids but underscores the irreplaceable value of human judgment, thorough testing, and clear documentation. The consensus leans toward using LLMs as tools to augment—not replace—developer expertise.

### Making o1, o3, and Sonnet 3.7 hallucinate for everyone

#### [Submission URL](https://bengarcia.dev/making-o1-o3-and-sonnet-3-7-hallucinate-for-everyone) | 255 points | by [hahahacorn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hahahacorn) | [208 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43222027)

In an interesting turn of events straight out of the tech world, a developer stumbled upon a peculiar syntax while helping a colleague troubleshoot some non-functional code. The issue? The colleague was using a non-existent syntax for preloading associations with conditions in Rails, inspired by a suggestion from ChatGPT.

The code in question was `User.includes(investments: -> { where(state: :draft) })`, a form that seemed intuitive but didn’t actually align with any known ActiveRecord feature. The developer’s curiosity led them down the rabbit hole, revealing that the syntax had stemmed from their own speculative post on a Rails forum two years prior. Despite its genesis in a lively API exploration discussion, the suggested method was flawed, much like a misremembered lesson from coding's formative years.

Oddly enough, this misleading guidance wasn't a solitary wander in the preliminary Void. The LLMs, or large language models like ChatGPT, were found to sometimes latch onto such niche suggestions, propagating them despite their absence from official documentation. The trip down memory lane reminded the developer of typical early-career tactics—spoiling coding elegance with copy-paste approaches gleaned from forums and questionable sources.

The episode offers a poignant reminder of the efficiency and pitfalls of AI-guided programming. While LLMs excel in many scenarios, their suggestions can veer into hallucinations without firm contextual grounding. Much like past developer experiences, they occasionally echo erroneous but endearing leaps into syntactic creativity. It's a gentle nudge to all developers: stay vigilant, fact-check AI suggestions, and embrace those adventurous programming dialogues with a healthy dose of skepticism.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion explores the dual-edged role of LLMs like ChatGPT in software development. Key points include:

1. **Efficiency vs. Errors**:
   - LLMs excel at generating **boilerplate code** and scaffolding, saving time on repetitive tasks. However, they frequently introduce bugs, incorrect syntax, or nonsensical changes (e.g., renaming variables, removing comments).
   - Critical code segments often require manual intervention, as LLMs struggle with **edge cases** and the final 10% of complex logic, leading to time-consuming debugging.

2. **Boilerplate vs. Abstractions**:
   - While useful for generic code, LLMs falter with meaningful **abstractions**. Users debate whether boilerplate is inherently bad or a necessary evil, noting that poorly designed abstractions can be worse than straightforward code.
   - Modern frameworks and libraries reduce boilerplate, but LLMs risk introducing "magic" code (e.g., dynamic reflection, monkey patching) that’s hard to maintain.

3. **Technical Debt & Best Practices**:
   - Overreliance on LLMs can lead to **technical debt**, especially when developers prioritize quick fixes over robust solutions. Static typing and code reviews are suggested as mitigations.
   - Concerns arise about AI-generated code passing reviews without proper testing, leading to latent issues in production.

4. **Use Cases & Limitations**:
   - LLMs are praised for aiding **beginners** (e.g., Arduino projects) but deemed unreliable for mission-critical systems.
   - Debugging AI-generated code remains challenging, with calls for better tooling (e.g., LSP integration) to catch errors early.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:
   - Skepticism exists around the "move fast, break things" ethos amplified by LLMs, with warnings about backward compatibility and maintainability in rapidly evolving projects.

**Takeaway**: LLMs are powerful assistants but require vigilant oversight. They democratize coding for novices and streamline repetitive tasks but risk propagating poor practices if unchecked. Balancing automation with critical thinking and robust testing is essential.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12962) | 34 points | by [TaurenHunter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=TaurenHunter) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43222834)

In a groundbreaking leap for the future of AI, a new paper titled "Infinite Retrieval: Attention Enhanced LLMs in Long-Context Processing" has been submitted on arXiv by Xiaoju Ye, Zhichun Wang, and Jingyuan Wang. The study tackles a major hurdle in the computational capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) — their limitations in handling inputs that exceed their context window size. This problem becomes particularly pronounced in tasks that involve retrieving and processing very long text inputs, like complex reasoning tasks.

The authors introduce a novel technique, InfiniRetri, which smartly leverages the inherent attention mechanisms of LLMs to accurately retrieve information from inputs of seemingly any length. This innovative method not only outperforms existing approaches by achieving 100% accuracy in a challenging "Needle-In-a-Haystack" test with over a million tokens, it also beats even larger models. Remarkably, InfiniRetri does this without imposing the substantial post-training costs typically needed to enhance long-context processing.

Moreover, the method significantly boosts performance on real-world benchmarks, reporting up to a 288% improvement without additional training or computational overheads. This advancement opens a new horizon for efficiently handling extensive texts through existing Transformer-based LLMs, vastly improving their practical applicability. With code expected to be released soon, this study not only sets a new state-of-the-art but signals an exciting direction for further enhancing AI's natural language processing abilities.
