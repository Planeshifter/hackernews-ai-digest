The paper "DoLa: Decoding by Contrasting Layers Improves Factuality in Large Language Models" introduces a novel decoding strategy to address hallucinations in large language models. By contrasting the differences in logits from later versus earlier layers, the approach, DoLa, helps surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. This method shows promising results, enhancing truthfulness in various tasks and improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA significantly. The paper, presented at ICLR 2024, offers insights into making LLMs more reliable in generating truthful facts without the need for additional fine-tuning or external knowledge. The source code for the study is also available for further exploration.
