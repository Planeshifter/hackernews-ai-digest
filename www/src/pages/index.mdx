### AWS Introduces a New JavaScript Runtime for Lambda

#### [Submission URL](https://www.i-programmer.info/news/81-web-general/17052-aws-introduces-a-new-javascript-runtime-for-lambda.html) | 34 points | by [bubblehack3r](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bubblehack3r) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39772268)

The latest news making waves on Hacker News is Amazon's introduction of a new JavaScript runtime called Low Latency Runtime (LLRT) for Lambda. Despite the plethora of existing JavaScript runtimes like Node.js, Deno, and Bun, LLRT is purpose-built for Lambda, boasting a significantly smaller size of just a few kilobytes to minimize cold start times. By optimizing for serverless use, LLRT aims to provide JavaScript developers with enhanced performance akin to low-level languages like Rust or C++ without the need for extensive knowledge in those languages. Powered by the QuickJS engine, LLRT supports most of the ES2023 specification and offers a fast interpreter with low startup time. While LLRT is still in the experimental stage and may lack compatibility with certain Node.js libraries, it presents an exciting opportunity for developers to explore. So, if you're keen to delve into the world of high-performance serverless JavaScript, LLRT might just be the playground for you!

- **vndklt** points out that using LLRT may make stable spending time looking like Rust Lambdas, but team members are hesitant due to the longer build times compared to existing Lambdas for Node.js. They mention that LLRT is essentially learning curve enabled TypeScript, JavaScript devs guessing what's happening in language front and back again, like with CDK TypeScript Lambdas and TypeScript frontend logic.  
- **pjmlp** agrees and states that LLRT needs to offer execution speed and memory consumption optimizations comparable to C#, Native AOT, Java, GraalVM, and Rust to be worth considering. They emphasize the necessity of keeping performance compiled languages faster build times by switching interpretors and bonus points for being ahead of the curve.
- **nnsnst** finds references to GraalVM Native Image challenging in AWS documentation, suggesting that using native AOT for deployment is recommended, with AWS leaning towards Azure support. In response to that, **pjmlp** adds an Amazon reference regarding the use of GraalVM in serverless environments.
- **brdlybd** shares a link to a related article discussing LLRT.
- **nnz** gives a reminder that if you are willing to run Lambda in a Docker container this year, AWS provides instructions not to miss. Also, not to overlook AWS's default runtimes variety.
- **spgrm** suggests writing commands in slightly stronger English.
- **tny-lln** notes QuickJS as an embedded scripting language related to Python.
- **mttsh** praises the size optimization of LLRT in contrast to its larger counterparts' requirements. They express excitement about the full performance ES2023 runtime that removes JIT GC, which sounds excellent to them.
- **rcrdbt** mentions the link to QuickJS's GitHub page.
- **jntywndrknd** dives into gross optimization nuances in LLRT, carrying runtime high cost penalty but central efficiency characteristics. They express skepticism about whether thicker runtime doesn't require tenant hosts. **pjmlp** jumps in to discuss the importance of Just-In-Time compilation and references Python's recent adoption of JIT implementation as a strong indicator.

### Nvidia turns up the AI heat with 1,200W Blackwell GPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/03/18/nvidia_turns_up_the_ai/) | 40 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39771146)

Nvidia is at it again, turning up the heat in the AI field with its latest Blackwell GPU architecture, unveiling a powerhouse during CEO Jensen Huang's keynote speech. The new Blackwell chips promise five times the performance of the H100, but be warned, you'll need liquid cooling to tame these beasts. The technical lead is extended with Blackwell, boasting impressive numbers on paper. The top-of-the-line Blackwell chips deliver around 5x more raw FLOPS and can reach 20 petaFLOPS, but only when using the new 4-bit floating point data type and liquid cooling. These chips, the B100, B200, and Grace-Blackwell Superchip (GB200), boast remarkable performance gains with a unique design of two compute dies interconnected via high-bandwidth fabric. Data center operators are already feeling the pressure of supporting Nvidia's high-power GPUs, and Blackwell is no different. Operating between 700W and 1,200W, these GPUs offer a significant performance boost but at the cost of increased power consumption. Liquid cooling is recommended to extract maximum performance, making it a tempting but challenging choice for data centers. In a bold move, Nvidia introduces the Grace-Blackwell Superchip (GB200) combining a 72-core CPU with two 1,200W GPUs, delivering a whopping 40 petaFLOPS of FP4 performance. With its advanced design and liquid cooling necessity, Nvidia is setting the bar high in the AI infrastructure race.
