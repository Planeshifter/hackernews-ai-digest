### Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say CA Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://themarkup.org/2024/06/12/these-wrongly-arrested-black-men-say-a-california-bill-would-let-police-misuse-face-recognition) | 10 points | by [cdme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cdme) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662980)

The article discusses the concerns of three Black men who were wrongly arrested due to police misuse of face recognition technology. These cases highlight the potential for civil rights violations and unjust consequences for individuals and their families. The men are now speaking out against a California bill that would restrict police from using face recognition as the sole basis for search or arrest, calling for more corroborating evidence.

Despite the bill's passage in the Senate Public Safety Committee, critics argue that a face recognition "match" is not conclusive evidence and can lead to wrongful arrests. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, defends the legislation as a necessary step to prevent such injustices and improve civil rights protections in California.

The use of face recognition technology by law enforcement has raised concerns about accuracy and bias, especially in identifying individuals with dark skin or other underrepresented groups. The reliance on eyewitness testimony, coupled with face recognition results, can further complicate criminal investigations and contribute to wrongful convictions.

The experiences of these men underscore the importance of addressing the pitfalls of face recognition technology and ensuring that individuals are not unjustly targeted or arrested based on flawed or biased algorithms.

The discussion revolves around the argument that human judgment is critical in policing to ensure accuracy and benefit society by addressing errors and maintaining accountability. There is a comparison between human error in decision-making and the flaws of face recognition technology, highlighting the potential consequences of blindly trusting computer algorithms. 

The conversation delves into the issue of automation bias, where individuals have a tendency to rely on automated systems even when they present errors or questionable outcomes. An example from the 80s involving a Navy ship mistaking a commercial CD player for missile signals is used to illustrate the limitations of solely trusting computer systems.

There is a debate about the importance of human judgment versus computer analysis, with one side emphasizing the necessity of human questioning and accountability in decision-making, while the other side acknowledges the benefits of computer technology in certain fields like aviation. Additionally, the discussion touches on the challenges faced by law enforcement in utilizing face recognition technology and the need for a balanced approach that considers both human expertise and technological tools.

Meta's latest move to use European data for AI training has raised eyebrows and concerns about privacy and consent. While Meta claims it aims to create culturally relevant AI for Europeans, the approach of automatically enrolling users without explicit consent is troubling. The complex opt-out process highlighted by Meta seems cumbersome and raises questions about how many users will actually go through the steps to protect their data.

The company's reliance on the "Legitimate Interests" clause under GDPR to process public data for AI training has sparked debate about the balance between corporate interests and individual rights. Critics argue that using publicly available data for corporate gain without explicit consent may amount to data exploitation.

Meta's push for AI innovation in Europe while navigating privacy laws underscores the need for transparent and responsible data practices. Users should have clear options to understand and control how their data is used. The company's insistence that stricter privacy measures could hinder European access to cutting-edge AI technology has sparked a larger debate about the intersection of data privacy and technological progress.
