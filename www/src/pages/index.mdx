### Re-fixing Servo's event-loop

#### [Submission URL](https://medium.com/@polyglot_factotum/re-fixing-servos-event-loop-e00bdf267385) | 113 points | by [Ygg2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ygg2) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41245901)

In a recent deep dive into the challenges of refining Servo's event-loop, Gregory Terzian examines a newly identified concurrency issue that complicates the rendering order of web content. As part of Servo's ongoing improvements, the team faced unexpected problems when implementing a simple filtering method for managing document updates. 

When multiple documents vie for the same event-loop—such as tabs or iframes—ensuring the correct rendering order becomes crucial. Terzian highlights a flaw in the existing batching mechanism used to manage rendering updates, which could lead to rendering tasks being stuck in a deadlock when a page closes. This happens because if a task is queued for one document but the associated event-loop is canceled prematurely, a subsequent document might be prevented from executing its tasks.

The proposed fix? Instead of a global batching mechanism, the batching should be scoped to individual pages, enhancing reliability. However, uncovering this flaw required a shift in thinking from linear task processing to more robust logical invariants, leading Terzian to employ TLA+ for modeling behaviors.

Through analytical modeling and informal verification, Terzian's work demonstrates how stronger invariants can prevent errors and support more efficient task execution. This approach not only solves the immediate problem but also provides a framework for future development and error detection within Servo.
