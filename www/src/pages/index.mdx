In a bold challenge to the prevailing narrative around artificial general intelligence (AGI), researchers from Radboud University and other institutions argue that the goal of creating machines with cognition comparable to humans is fundamentally flawed. Published in the journal *Computational Brain & Behavior*, the study, led by Iris van Rooij, highlights that even under ideal conditions—where engineers have perfect datasets and optimal machine learning methods—achieving AGI is virtually impossible. 

The researchers emphasize the vast complexities of human cognition, which cannot be replicated merely through computational power. They warn against the inflated expectations fueled by tech giants like OpenAI and Google DeepMind, arguing that reliance on these claims may lead to misperceptions about AI capabilities. Van Rooij calls for increased “critical AI literacy” to help people discern the realistic potential of AI systems and to question the often-profit-driven promises from the tech industry. 

This analysis serves as a reminder that while AI technology is rapidly advancing, the pursuit of true human-like intelligence remains a distant, and perhaps unrealistic, dream.
