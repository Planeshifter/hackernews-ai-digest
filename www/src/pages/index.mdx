### Genode – Genode on seL4 – IPC and virtual memory

#### [Submission URL](https://genode.org/documentation/articles/sel4_part_2) | 54 points | by [whereistimbo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whereistimbo) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38060698)

The article starts by explaining that in the L4 universe, IPC usually refers to synchronous communication between threads. In the case of seL4, IPC serves two purposes - enabling threads of different protection domains to exchange messages and delegating access rights throughout the system. Genode, a microkernel-based operating system, implements IPC using two thin abstractions: the IPC library for low-level message sending and receiving, and the RPC framework for higher-level message transfers.

To enable Genode's RPC mechanism on seL4, the author provides a seL4-specific IPC library implementation. To familiarize themselves with seL4's IPC mechanism, they modify an existing test program to perform an IPC call between two threads. The author walks through the code modifications needed to create an IPC endpoint, receive an incoming message, and make an IPC call.

However, when executing the code, they encounter an error related to an uninitialized register. The author fixes this error by initializing the GS register properly. Nevertheless, another error occurs due to the lack of a proper IPC buffer for the second thread. To solve this, the author sets up the IPC buffer for the second thread on the same page as the initial thread's IPC buffer.

With the initialization of the IPC buffer in place, the author finally achieves the desired output. The article concludes with the author's plan to address memory management issues in future articles in the series.

Overall, this article provides a detailed and hands-on exploration of IPC and virtual memory in the context of bringing Genode to the seL4 kernel. It offers valuable insights for those interested in kernel development and operating system design.

The discussion around the article "Genode on seL4 - IPC and virtual memory" on Hacker News includes several comments from users. 

User "rdtrmph" expresses their appreciation for sharing fascinating projects related to low-level operating system development in C++. They are interested in such projects and have their own ongoing project.

User "Palomides" comments that while they believe the project is overly hyped and practically unnecessary, it does showcase impressive achievements in software. They find the concept of running a microkernel-based BSD-like operating system on seL4 interesting but not practically valuable.

User "arp242" adds that comparing real-world performance of such systems to Linux and Windows could be an interesting exercise.

User "pjmlp" shares a link to a YouTube video about a C++ operating system utilizing coroutines and standard execution on a Raspberry Pi Pico.

In a recent talk at TED AI, Stephen Wolfram discussed the concept of computation and its implications for understanding the universe. Wolfram argued that computation is not just a possible formalization of the world, but the ultimate formalization for our universe. He explained that space and matter are made up of discrete elements, and the structure of the universe is defined by the network of relations between these elements. Using computational rules, the entire universe can be built from these discrete elements. Wolfram also discussed the emergence of gravity and quantum mechanics from these computational rules, and how different observers perceive the branching paths of the universe. He introduced the concept of the "ruliad," which is the unique object that encompasses all possible computational processes. Wolfram explained that observers, like us, can only sample specific slices of the ruliad, and that our perceived laws of physics are a result of our computational limitations and our belief in persistence in time.

Researchers from NYU Tandon School of Engineering have developed a groundbreaking method to visually track targets using quadcopters. This new approach, outlined in a recently uploaded paper, utilizes a unified foundation model that operates efficiently even with limited hardware. The researchers claim that their system can accurately detect a variety of objects, from humans to pigeons. To demonstrate the effectiveness of their technology, they shared a video showcasing quadcopters tracking humans as they try to escape. It's both impressive and just a touch unsettling. So, prepare yourself for a future where drones may have the upper hand in pursuit.
