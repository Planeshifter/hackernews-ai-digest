A recent exciting development in the tech world is the open-sourcing of an AI-powered WordPress site builder called QuickWP. This innovative project utilizes AI from OpenAI, an FSE theme, and WordPress Playground to craft personalized themes based on the user's website topic and description.

The concept of QuickWP emerged from the team's desire to experiment with AI and OpenAI APIs. While previous attempts at integrating AI into website building were primitive and generic, the idea for QuickWP took shape based on wireframes. By creating an FSE theme with wireframes and leveraging AI to select patterns based on user prompts, the team aimed to streamline the process of generating website themes quickly and efficiently.

The project stack for QuickWP comprised a diverse set of components including the FSE theme as the project base, a base plugin with necessary functionalities and UI elements, and an API endpoint facilitating communication with the OpenAI API.

The FSE theme acted as the foundation of the project, allowing for easy prototyping by starting from a fork of the Twenty Twenty-Four theme and customizing it to suit the project's needs. Incorporating AI prompt generation using OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models, the team experimented with various AI models to enhance the user experience.

To address the challenge of image generation, QuickWP tapped into the vast resources of CC0 images available online, specifically opting to utilize Pexels for its extensive image library and liberal request limits.

One key aspect the team focused on was maintaining context site-wide to ensure consistency across the website's content and design elements. By implementing strategies to uphold context integrity when generating content, the project aimed to provide users with a seamless and cohesive website-building experience.

Overall, the release of QuickWP offers developers and enthusiasts the opportunity to explore the intricacies of AI-powered website building and learn from the project's insights, challenges, and innovative solutions. By open-sourcing the code base, the team behind QuickWP hopes to inspire others to create remarkable projects and contribute to the evolving landscape of AI-driven web development.

### GoFetch: New side-channel attack using data memory-dependent prefetchers

#### [Submission URL](https://gofetch.fail) | 247 points | by [kingsleyopara](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kingsleyopara) | [70 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39779195)

The GoFetch attack has shaken up the cybersecurity world by revealing a significant threat to constant-time cryptographic implementations on Apple CPUs. Researchers have uncovered a vulnerability in the data memory-dependent prefetchers (DMPs) present in Apple processors, allowing for the extraction of secret keys from various cryptographic protocols like OpenSSL Diffie-Hellman and Go RSA.

The team behind GoFetch includes experts from renowned institutions such as the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, University of Texas at Austin, and Carnegie Mellon University. By reverse-engineering the DMPs on Apple m-series CPUs, they demonstrated how these prefetchers can be exploited to compromise the security of cryptographic operations.

The GoFetch attack differs from previous research like Augury by revealing that the DMP activation criteria are more aggressive than initially thought, posing a more significant security risk. This breakthrough sheds light on the importance of constant-time programming and the dangers of cache side-channel attacks in modern processors.

Furthermore, the researchers found that other Apple processors like m2 and m3, as well as Intel's 13th Gen Raptor Lake microarchitecture, also exhibit exploitable DMP behavior. While the security implications of DMPs are concerning, they provide valuable insights into the vulnerabilities of current hardware architectures and the need for stronger defense mechanisms in cryptographic implementations.

The discussion on the GoFetch attack submission on Hacker News is diverse, covering topics such as constant-time cryptography implementations, processor design considerations for security, the role of JavaScript in computing security, and the need for a balance between performance and security in hardware and software design.
