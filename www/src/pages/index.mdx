#### [Submission URL](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/owning-my-own-data-part-1-integrating-a-self-hosted-calendar-solution/) | 370 points | by [ColinWright](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ColinWright) | [139 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43643343)

Imagine having control over your entire data ecosystem, from files to calendars, without being tied to big tech giants. That's the journey our intrepid tech enthusiast has embarked upon in a series about reclaiming tech independence and data sovereignty. 

In the kickoff installment, they share a glimpse into their world of hyper-travel, involving job duties, romantic commitments across miles, and the urgent need for a reliable and private calendar system. Their existing calendar setup, tangled in timezone challenges and lacking in flexibility, was far from ideal. Commercial products like Google Calendar have dominated the scene, while options laden with subscription fees and privacy concerns just don't cut it for someone seeking more autonomy.

Determined to overhaul this situation, they embarked on building a customized, self-hosted calendar solution. Their key requirements included seamless synchronization across devices, cross-timezone management, privacy, and automatic event integration, including from a self-hosted flight tracker. The initial workaround involved hand-crafting YAML files and generating ICS files—a clever but ultimately cumbersome setup for long-term use.

Recognizing the limitations, our innovator turned to CalDAV, an extension of WebDAV designed for calendar applications. While this move means greater self-hosting, and likely costs, it represents a step forward in breaking the chains of big tech dependency. With the first phase documented, readers can look forward to more chronicles on this quest for digital autonomy—a journey filled with trials, innovation, and the hope for a broader revolution in personalized tech solutions. Stay tuned!

   - **kridsdale1** highlights CalDAV's fragility, especially with non-compliant servers like Google’s, leading to sync issues.  
   - **JMAP** (JSON Meta Application Protocol) is proposed as a simpler alternative, with an RFC draft and proxy implementations bridging JMAP and CalDAV (via tools like Cyrus Server).

2. **Time Zone Challenges**:
   - Debates erupt over handling time zones, DST changes, and recurring events. **fc417fc802** suggests storing timestamps in TAI or UTC, but others argue that local context (e.g., "3 PM Berlin time") is unavoidable and error-prone.  
   - **thqx** and **et1337** stress the practical pitfalls of time zones, like DST shifts causing meetings to misalign, and the need for robust datetime libraries to manage conversions.  
   - **ElectricalUnion** recommends RFC 9557 (IXDTF) to preserve time zone metadata, avoiding data loss during conversions.

3. **Real-World Complexity**:
   - Participants acknowledge that political changes (e.g., Arizona’s DST laws) or last-minute time zone adjustments complicate “perfect” solutions.  
   - **toast0** notes that calendar clients often ignore time zone definitions in iCal files, relying on UTC and hoping for proper display—a fragile approach.  

**Consensus**: While technical workarounds exist, perfect calendar syncing remains elusive due to the interplay of protocol limitations, human-centric scheduling preferences ("3 PM local time"), and unpredictable real-world factors. Developers are urged to leverage datetime libraries and standards like IXDTF while accepting that edge cases will persist.

#### [Submission URL](http://nathanmarz.com/blog/suffering-oriented-programming.html) | 73 points | by [whalesalad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whalesalad) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43646601)

In the intriguing world of software engineering, Nathan Marz, the creator of Apache Storm, introduces us to a unique approach called "suffering-oriented programming." This development style, born from Nathan's experience with building Storm—a real-time computation system—suggests that you shouldn't create technology unless you're feeling the acute absence of it. 

The philosophy condenses into a mantra: "First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast." It's a process he outlines through the evolution of Storm, emphasizing a practical progression from understanding immediate needs to refining elegance and eventually optimizing speed and efficiency.

Initially, during the "make it possible" phase, solutions should be straightforward and directly address the problems at hand, no matter how inelegant. This phase involves a raw hacking-out approach that helps you gain insights into the problem's intricacies without over-complicating things prematurely. This phase helped Nathan's team comprehend and address the glaring inefficiencies in their initial stream processing system.

Once a practical solution has been implemented and the problem space is well-mapped, the focus shifts to designing a "beautiful" technology. Here, developers apply deep understanding acquired from the first phase to strip down solutions to their simplest abstractions. This approach avoids overengineering, ensuring the system elegantly handles current use cases without falling prey to the pitfalls of trying to preemptively solve hypothetical future problems.

Finally, by "making it fast," you're optimizing your well-designed solution to enhance performance without sacrificing the foundational elegance and functionality.

Nathan's approach to software development not only led to the creation of Storm but also provides an insightful guideline for tackling big projects effectively by prioritizing necessity, understanding, and eventual refinement. This philosophy not only resonates deeply with many in the tech community but also serves as a powerful tool for risk management and project success in entrepreneurial and startup environments.

1. **Philosophical Debates:**
   - The **"principle of maximum inconvenience"** was highlighted, suggesting intentional discomfort (e.g., tackling hard problems first) can yield better solutions. References to Stoicism ("Marcus Aurelius") and productivity strategies ("Eat the Frog") underscored this idea.
   - A counterpoint warned against overcomplicating tasks, emphasizing the need for **strategic prioritization** over arbitrary hardship.

2. **TDD Controversy:**
   - Developers debated **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**. Some argued it reduces "suffering" by clarifying assumptions and enabling safer iterations, while others viewed it as restrictive or premature for early-stage projects. Comments reflected tensions between theoretical rigor ("checking boxes") and practical flexibility.

3. **Real-World Applications:**
   - **Nathan Marz's work on Storm and Rama** exemplified the "make it possible, then beautiful" approach. Users detailed how iterating from foundational infrastructure (e.g., solving backend issues at Twitter) to elegant abstractions led to impactful tools, reinforcing the submission’s core thesis.
   - **SaaS development experiences** illustrated balancing rapid iteration with scalability, favoring lightweight business logic over rigid class hierarchies.

4. **Humor and Critique:**
   - Playful terms like **"surfing-oriented programming"** parodied the original concept, while critiques questioned whether *all* suffering is productive. The line between solving genuine pain points and inventing problems was a recurring theme.

5. **Methodological Connections:**
   - Comparisons to **Extreme Programming** emphasized addressing pain points early to drive clean architecture. Others stressed building solutions only when existing alternatives are truly inadequate, avoiding "reinventing the wheel."

**Conclusion:** The discussion reflects a nuanced embrace of Marz’s philosophy—valuing necessity-driven development while cautioning against dogma. TDD debates and real-world examples like Rama highlight the balance between structured discipline and adaptive problem-solving.

### Obituary for Cyc

#### [Submission URL](https://yuxi-liu-wired.github.io/essays/posts/cyc/) | 408 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [216 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625474)

In the realm of artificial intelligence, few names evoke as much intrigue as Douglas Lenat's, particularly due to his monumental Cyc project. Begun in 1985, Cyc aimed to crack the nut of artificial general intelligence through an ambitious strategy: scaling symbolic logic by encoding vast amounts of common sense knowledge. Lenat believed that for AI to truly learn and reason like humans, it needed a massive repository of world knowledge to draw from—a theory steeped in his experiences with past projects like the Automated Mathematician and EURISKO.

Despite Lenat's unwavering dedication and the project's staggering investment—culminating in 30 million assertions at the cost of $200 million and 2,000 person-years—the breakthroughs promised never materialized. The Cyc system, conceived as a groundbreaking "knowledge pump," never achieved the self-sustaining knowledge expansion and learning Lenat envisioned. Instead, its practical applications remained rooted in established AI methodologies, akin to those employed by tech giants like Oracle and IBM, offering no discernible competitive edge.

The project's long-term sustainability can partly be attributed to substantial funding from military and commercial sectors. However, this financial footing didn’t translate into revolutionary academic contributions or public success stories. As academia largely shunned Cyc for its inaccessibility and lack of performance on public benchmarks, the project became an insular endeavor, closed off from the outside innovation swirling around in AI research.

Despite the ultimate lack of success in achieving its grand ambitions, the Cyc project stands as a fascinating chapter in AI history—a testament to the challenges of scaling symbolic logic for general intelligence. The story of Cyc, and the "secret history" behind it, underline the complexities and limits of symbolic approaches in AI, raising questions—and lessons—for the field's ongoing evolution. Today, with much of Cyc's archival materials now available for public scrutiny on platforms like GitHub, the legacy of Douglas Lenat's quest sheds light on the perpetual struggle to teach machines to understand the world as deeply as humans do.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legacy of **Douglas Lenat’s Cyc project** and its contrast with modern AI approaches like **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Here’s a concise summary of key points:

### Cyc’s Ambitions vs. Reality
- **Cyc’s Goal**: Encode "common sense" via symbolic logic (e.g., understanding that a person can’t shave with an unplugged electric razor).  
- **Critique**: Despite decades of effort and millions of hand-coded assertions, Cyc struggled with scalability, brittleness, and practical relevance. Participants noted its failure to achieve self-sustaining learning or outperform traditional rule-based systems (e.g., Prolog) or newer data-driven methods.

### Symbolic AI vs. LLMs
- **Symbolic AI (Cyc/GOFAI)**: Relied on explicit rules and logic but was limited by manual curation and inability to handle real-world ambiguity. Examples like SAT solvers and planners were praised for structured problems but criticized for lacking flexibility.  
- **LLMs**: Praised for scaling via vast data and "fuzzy" contextual understanding. While not perfect, LLMs excel at generating plausible outputs by recognizing patterns, even if they lack true reasoning. Critics argued LLMs still struggle with logical rigor (e.g., transitive relations).  

### Hybrid Approaches
- **Bridging the Gap**: Some suggested combining LLMs (for natural language understanding) with symbolic systems (for structured reasoning). For example, using LLMs to translate natural language into Prolog/Python code or structured formats (JSON) for traditional computation.  
- **Use Cases**: LLMs could handle ambiguous tasks (e.g., parsing nutrition labels), while symbolic systems manage precise logic (e.g., scheduling, math).  

### Legacy and Lessons
- **Cyc’s Legacy**: A bold experiment highlighting the challenges of manual knowledge engineering. Its closed, insular development contrasted with today’s open, collaborative AI research.  
- **Modern Parallels**: Debates echoed around whether LLMs are merely "stochastic parrots" or stepping stones toward AGI. Participants acknowledged that neither symbolic nor statistical methods alone suffice for general intelligence.  

### Final Takeaway
The discussion underscores a shift from rigid symbolic systems (Cyc) to flexible, data-driven models (LLMs), while acknowledging that **hybrid approaches**—leveraging the strengths of both paradigms—might be the future of AI. Cyc remains a cautionary tale about scalability and the limits of human-curated knowledge, even as LLMs redefine what’s possible.

### Solving a “Layton Puzzle” with Prolog

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/a48fce5b-8a05-4302-b620-9b26f057f145/) | 101 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43625452)

Have you ever wanted to solve a brain-tickling puzzle using logic programming? Here's a delightful tale of solving a "Layton Puzzle" using Prolog—a classic logic programming language. Imagine a test with 10 questions, each with true/false options, and you'd like to determine the fourth student's score based on the scores of the first three students with known answers. Pablo Meier once tackled a similar challenge, using Prolog to crack the code, but this tale goes a step further with an elegant solution in fewer lines of code.

Firstly, here's the setup: You know how three students scored and their answers, and need to predict the elusive score of the fourth student. With a quick dive into Prolog, the programmer begins by importing essential modules for handling inequalities and setting up constraints. Using Prolog’s pattern matching prowess, we create a recursive function to calculate a score by comparing answers to a key, cleverly bypassing more procedural if-else statements traditional programming uses.

The magic of Prolog shines here with its bidirectionality; you can use the program both to verify a known score and to deduce an unknown one. Through predicates and mappings, Prolog also generates potential answer keys, further showcasing the elegant and multipurpose nature of the language.

When the program runs, it finds four possible keys all producing the same score for the mystery student, revealing that the puzzle isn't broken but intriguingly self-consistent. This logic solution not only solves the problem but does so with remarkable efficiency—15 lines to accomplish what took 80 lines in another version. It's puzzles like these and solutions like this that show the enduring magic of logic programming.

So if you find yourself pondering logic puzzles or practical applications with Prolog, keep in mind the potential simplicity behind seemingly complex challenges. Plus, who doesn't want a chance to show up a fellow programmer with fewer lines of smarter code?

The Hacker News discussion revolves around solving a Professor Layton logic puzzle using Prolog and alternative methods, with key points summarized below:

The approach leverages constraints to find valid answer keys, revealing Colin’s score as **60** across four possible configurations.  
   - Debates arose about Prolog’s practicality, comparing implementations (SWI-Prolog, SICStus) and praising its bidirectional reasoning for logic puzzles.  

2. **Z3 in Python**  
   - A user demonstrated a concise 7-line solution using Z3, a theorem prover, to model the problem declaratively. Others highlighted its simplicity compared to Prolog ([example blog post](https://happyhacks.bearblog.dev/solving-lytn-pzzl-wth-z3)).

### **Human-Logic Approaches**
   - A manual, heuristic-driven breakdown analyzed overlaps in student answers to deduce Colin’s score. For instance, comparing Mary’s and Dan’s incorrect answers narrowed down possible correct keys, concluding Colin scored **60** by leveraging shared patterns.

### **Nostalgia & Puzzle Design**
   - Fans reminisced about the *Professor Layton* game series (specifically *Diabolical Box*), praising its puzzle design. Some linked the challenge to classic logic puzzles like the Zebra Puzzle, often tackled with Prolog.

### **Broader Discussions**
   - **Prolog’s Relevance**: A tangent debated Prolog’s decline in popularity despite its strengths in constraint-solving, referencing a [2023 thread](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35623625) on its historical context.

Meta recently found itself in hot water after it was revealed that the tech giant may have gamed AI benchmarks to make its new Llama 4 models appear more competitive. Over the weekend, Meta released two new models, Scout and Maverick, asserting that Maverick outperformed OpenAI's GPT-4o and others on LMArena, a popular comparison site for AI outputs. However, eagle-eyed AI researchers discovered a crucial bit of information buried in Meta’s documentation: the version of Maverick tested was an "experimental chat version" specifically designed to excel in conversational tasks.

This revelation prompted LMArena to clarify its policies, emphasizing the importance of fair and reproducible evaluations. Meta's spokesperson responded, highlighting their extensive experimentation with custom versions of their AI models. While not violating direct LMArena rules, the incident raises serious concerns about the integrity of AI benchmarks. Developers often rely on these scores to make informed decisions about which AI models to use, but if companies like Meta submit souped-up versions that aren't publicly available, these benchmarks lose their reliability as tools for assessing true performance.

The timing of the release further fueled speculation, as it dropped on a Saturday—a rarity in the tech world. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg simply noted, "That’s when it was ready." The mixed messages and questionable tactics have left many in the AI community scratching their heads, pondering whether benchmarks are becoming more about gaming the system rather than providing genuine insights into AI capabilities. This saga underscores the increasing competitiveness in AI development as companies vie for leadership and recognition.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward Meta’s AI benchmarking practices and connects it to broader criticisms of the company’s internal culture and management strategies. Key themes include:

1. **Benchmark Gaming Concerns**:  
   Users speculate that Meta’s claim of outperforming GPT-4o with its experimental "Maverick" model may reflect a focus on optimizing for benchmarks rather than genuine performance. This ties to fears that benchmarks are becoming marketing tools instead of reliable evaluations.

2. **Cultural Critiques**:  
   - **"Move Fast and Break Things" Legacy**: Commenters argue Meta’s historical emphasis on speed over quality fosters rushed, half-baked releases. This leads to technical debt and undermines long-term product reliability.  
   - **Performance-Driven Pressures**: Employees are incentivized to prioritize metrics (e.g., launching features quickly) over quality to meet review cycles, exacerbating issues like technical debt and unstable AI models.  

3. **Management and Incentive Structures**:  
   - Layoffs and high turnover are critiqued for reducing institutional knowledge, leaving fewer skilled workers to manage complex projects.  
   - The **Hawthorne Effect** and **McNamara Fallacy** are cited: Management’s focus on short-term metrics (e.g., quarterly results) creates temporary performance boosts but neglects sustainable progress, leading to employee burnout and rushed releases.  

4. **Data Quality Questions**:  
   Skepticism arises about whether Meta’s AI improvements stem from better data or are merely tactics to game benchmarks. Users question if the company’s internal data management can support claims of superior model performance.  

5. **Broader Tech Industry Parallels**:  
   Comparisons to Netflix’s high-pressure culture highlight systemic issues in tech, where aggressive performance incentives prioritize rapid delivery over innovation and employee well-being.  

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects distrust in Meta’s benchmarking claims, linking them to a culture that prioritizes short-term wins and metrics over transparency and quality. Critics argue this undermines both the reliability of AI evaluations and the sustainability of Meta’s advancements.

In an exciting leap towards achieving general superintelligence, Cogito has unveiled its latest suite of large language models (LLMs) in various sizes from 3 billion to 70 billion parameters. These models, launched under an open license, set a new benchmark by outperforming all existing open-source models of equivalent sizes, even beating advanced models like the recently released Llama 4 109B MoE.

The magic behind these superior LLMs is the innovative Iterated Distillation and Amplification (IDA) training strategy. IDA offers a pathway to break free from the inherent limitations set by human overseers, ensuring consistent self-improvement without their bounds. This method enhances the model's reasoning by iteratively amplifying intelligence through computational power before distilling these capabilities back into the model, creating a powerful feedback loop of growth.

What this means is these models can think like traditional LLMs, and also engage in self-reflective reasoning, making them robust tools for complex problem-solving and agentic tasks. As a testament to their efficiency, the Cogito team developed these models swiftly in just over two months, indicating the scalability and time effectiveness of their method.

The excitement doesn’t stop here—larger models, including the ambitious 671 billion parameter model, are on the horizon. For developers and researchers eagerly awaiting to tinker with these cutting-edge models, they're readily accessible on platforms like Huggingface or through APIs on Fireworks AI and Together AI.

The success of Cogito’s models in industry-standard benchmarks not only validates IDA's potential but paves a structured path to transcend today's AI intelligence limits, nudging closer to the dawn of general superintelligence. As this journey unfolds, these models promise to adapt well beyond dry benchmarks, aiming to deliver powerful real-world solutions tailored to user needs.
