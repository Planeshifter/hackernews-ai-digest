### Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01603) | 65 points | by [beefman](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=beefman) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37627615)

A new research paper titled "Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine for Systematic Generalization" proposes a machine learning model that aims to achieve systematic generalization, a human-like ability to learn compositional rules from limited data and apply them to unseen combinations in various domains. The authors introduce the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR), which utilizes a Grounded Symbol System (GSS) with combinatorial syntax and semantics. NSR consists of separate modules for neural perception, syntactic parsing, and semantic reasoning, which are jointly learned using a deduction-abduction algorithm. The researchers demonstrate that NSR achieves superior systematic generalization on three benchmarks from different domains: semantic parsing, string manipulation, and arithmetic reasoning. NSR outperforms state-of-the-art models on the arithmetic reasoning benchmark by approximately 23%. The authors attribute NSR's strong generalization to its symbolic representation and inductive biases, as well as its better transferability compared to existing neural-symbolic approaches. The paper provides insights into how NSR can effectively model various sequence-to-sequence tasks.

The discussion on this submission started with a comment pointing out that existing machine learning models often fail to achieve human-like systematic generalization. The commenter also mentions a recent paper published by the creators of ChatGPT, reinforcing the relevance of the topic. Another commenter responds, expressing their belief that the Neural-Symbolic Recursive Machine (NSR) mentioned in the submission is similar to an existing model called MoE (Mixture of Experts). They suggest that the NSR implementation might be costly compared to the MoE approach, but it is not clear from the comment why this is the case.

### Auto-Regressive Next-Token Predictors Are Universal Learners

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06979) | 91 points | by [dataminer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dataminer) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37619513)

Researchers have discovered that auto-regressive next-token predictors, such as language models, have the ability to solve complex tasks involving logical and mathematical reasoning. In a recent study, Eran Malach presented a theoretical framework for studying these predictors and showed that even simple models like linear and shallow Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) can approximate any function efficiently computed by a Turing machine. The researchers introduced a new complexity measure called "length complexity" and analyzed its relationship with other notions of complexity. They also conducted experiments that demonstrated the non-trivial performance of these predictors on text generation and arithmetic tasks. The study suggests that the power of language models may be attributed to the auto-regressive next-token training scheme, rather than a specific choice of architecture.

The discussion around the submission involves various perspectives on the power and implications of language models in solving complex tasks. Some commenters highlight the deterministic nature of linguistic determinism and its influence on thinking processes. Others point out that language skills do not necessarily equate to general intelligence and that there is a wide range of models and formalisms beyond Turing completeness that can approximate different types of thinking. 

There is also a conversation about the efficacy of language models in terms of practical applications, such as medical research and clinical note analysis. Some suggest that language models could be helpful in generating prompts for medical reports, while others caution that these models can encounter difficulties in generating coherent narratives.

There is interest in the concept of training models regressively and the challenges posed by difficult tasks, as well as the potential of intermediate steps in internal processing and the learning of step-by-step procedures. Some commenters express curiosity about the workings of language models and suggest that the focusing on regressive models in learning may enhance their performance.

One commenter provides a link to a related discussion on Hacker News with additional perspectives on the topic. Another commenter criticizes the practice of prompt engineering and suggests exploring alternative approaches.

### I made a transformer to predict a simple sequence manually

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/handmade-transformer/) | 329 points | by [lukastyrychtr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lukastyrychtr) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37609393)

In a blog post on September 11, 2023, the author shares their experience of building a transformer from scratch without training it. They wanted to gain a deeper understanding of transformers and attention, so they decided to manually assign each weight for a decoder-only transformer inspired by GPT-2.

The author starts by picking a task that is not too easy but also not too challenging. They settle on predicting a sequence of "aabaabaabaab...," which requires querying the previous two tokens to determine the next token. To simplify the problem, they use a tokenization scheme where "a" is represented by 0 and "b" by 1.

Next, the author designs the model based on jaymody's picoGPT implementation of GPT-2. They define functions for softmax, linear transformations, and attention calculations. The attention function takes in query (q), key (k), and value (v) matrices, and a mask, and returns the attention weights. The causal_self_attention function applies causal masking to hide future inputs and performs the attention calculation. The transformer_block function is then used to add the output of the attention calculation to the input.

Finally, the author mentions that they have implemented the necessary functions up to this point and will continue explaining the remaining parts in the next blog post.

This hands-on approach to building a transformer without relying on pretrained weights or training provides the author with a better understanding of transformers and attention. It also serves as a valuable resource for readers interested in delving into the inner workings of transformers.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of the blog post that describes building a transformer from scratch without training it. Here are some notable points from the discussion:

- One user shares a link to a blog post about Thinking Transformers, which explores using a primitive programming language called RASP to simulate the components of a transformer model.
- Others express interest in the hands-on approach and recommend following the work demonstrated by the author.
- One user notes that they initially struggled to understand transformers when they implemented them from scratch without pretraining. Their experience was different from the standard PyTorch transformer implementation, and they realized that training and backpropagation were not as straightforward as expected.
- Another user shares a link to a video by Andrej Karpathy discussing building a Neural Network from scratch, which they find relevant to the topic.
- The challenge of working with weights in models and the interpretability of specific clusters of neurons are discussed.
- The discussion delves into the idea of compressing machine learning models and the potential for more efficient and controllable interfaces.
- Some users highlight the difficulty of manually adjusting weights and the downstream effects of modifying weights in transformers.
- The attention mechanisms present in transformers are discussed, and it is noted that they do not necessarily represent semantics understandable to humans.
- The complexity and interpretability of weights in transformers are compared to the Traveling Salesman Problem, and the limitations of solving certain problems with transformers are mentioned.
- One user points out that neural networks are Turing machines and that the weights represent approximations of the computation process.

Overall, the discussion appreciates the hands-on approach of building a transformer from scratch and dives into various technical aspects and implications of the topic.

### Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller models

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/09/distilling-step-by-step-outperforming.html) | 309 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37606352)

A team of researchers from Google's Cloud AI team has developed a new mechanism called "distilling step-by-step" that allows smaller task-specific models to outperform larger language models (LLMs) with less training data. LLMs, such as BERT and T5, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing but tend to be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. The researchers found that by extracting informative natural language rationales from LLMs, they could train smaller models more efficiently. These rationales, which explain the connections between input questions and their corresponding outputs, provide additional supervision during training. The team demonstrated that a 770M parameter T5 model could outperform a 540B parameter PaLM model using only 80% of the examples in a benchmark dataset. This approach offers a potential solution for deploying high-performance natural language models in applications with limited computational resources.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the use of smaller task-specific models versus larger language models (LLMs) in natural language processing. Some users argue that using multiple smaller models instead of a single large model can be more effective in certain applications. Others point out the potential limitations of this approach and discuss different techniques for training smaller models. Some users also share related papers and resources on the subject. There is a debate about the effectiveness of curriculum training and the need for comprehensive training data for LLMs. The discussion also touches on the relevance of text generation and the importance of high-quality training data. Finally, there are conversations regarding the similarities and differences between LLMs and human intelligence, as well as the need for specialized resources like textbooks in natural language processing.

They claim that OpenAI copied their works without permission to train ChatGPT. Both cases raise important questions about the copyright implications of training large language models on copyrighted data. The outcomes of these cases could significantly impact the development and use of such models.

In the discussion on Hacker News, one user finds it interesting that Sarah Silverman tweeted about the lawsuits and wonders if she is involved in them. Another user points out the irony that internet history is preserved by Chrome browsers but automatically deleted after three months.

Another user comments on the claims made in the lawsuits, mentioning that one of them states that OpenAI may have copied incorrect statements from journalists. Another user clarifies that the journalist's article was not published, and OpenAI's claims were based on misinformation. They also find it amusing that the court asked ChatGPT to summarize a real federal court case, demonstrating the AI's inability to retrieve URLs by default.

There is discussion about the knowledge gap regarding AI among law practitioners, and one user finds it amusing that the conversation has strayed from discussing the copyright infringement claims to exploring the limitations of ChatGPT.

Overall, the discussion touches on various aspects of the lawsuits, including incorrect statements made by journalists, the AI's capabilities and limitations, and the potential impact on civil rights.

Microsoft is introducing a new AI-powered feature called Copilot, which will act as an everyday AI companion across various Microsoft products. Copilot will leverage the context and intelligence of the web, user data, and current PC activities to provide better assistance. It will be available in Windows 11, Microsoft 365, Edge, and Bing. The feature aims to unify AI capabilities and provide a seamless experience. In addition to Copilot, Microsoft announced updates to Windows 11, Bing, and Microsoft 365, as well as new Surface devices. The Windows 11 update will bring over 150 new features, including enhancements to apps like Paint and Photos with AI capabilities. Bing will support the latest DALL.E 3 model from OpenAI and offer personalized answers based on user search history. Microsoft 365 Copilot will be available for enterprise customers on November 1, 2023, along with Microsoft 365 Chat, a new AI assistant.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to Microsoft's AI-powered feature, Copilot, as well as other Microsoft products. One user, CoreyFieldens, mentions the use of cryptographic methods and invisible digital watermarks in AI-generated images on Bing, including time data originally created, to support content credentials. Another user, rjh29, suggests using watermarking, resizing, cropping, and redrawing techniques to remove visible watermarks. FrostKiwi adds that traditional steganography solutions may not survive resizing and suggests a scrambled content approach as a solution. Another user, thrsvnths, mentions that content credentials can be included in images touched by Adobe Firefly, hoping for interoperable implementations of these watermarks. A user named kpnd mentions installing Firefox and receives a response from brryrndll, who jokingly expects a heated argument, specifically to prevent using Edge. Another user, dmntr, expresses a desire to install Linux and mentions some issues they have encountered with Discord and screen sharing. They also mention the availability of Easy Anti-Cheat on Linux for multiplayer AAA titles, depending on the distribution and Steam Proton runtime.

### Language Modeling Is Compression

#### [Submission URL](https://huggingface.co/papers/2309.10668) | 26 points | by [haltist](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haltist) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37600376)

The featured paper on Hacker News today explores the connection between language modeling and lossless data compression. The authors argue that there is an equivalence between predictive modeling and compression, and that large language models like Transformers can serve as powerful compressors. They demonstrate that even language models trained primarily on text can achieve impressive compression rates on datasets like ImageNet images and LibriSpeech audio. However, the authors also note that model size plays a role in compression performance, and there is an optimal tradeoff between model size and dataset size. Tokenization is also discussed as a form of compression, with simpler tokenizers like ASCII leading to better compression rates. The paper concludes by highlighting that the prediction-compression equivalence allows any compressor to be used as a conditional generative model. Overall, the paper provides a compression viewpoint on language modeling and large models, shedding light on in-context learning, scaling laws, tokenization, and generation.

The discussion on Hacker News mainly revolves around the connections between language modeling and lossless data compression mentioned in the featured paper. One user expresses confusion about the relevance of the PAC learnability framework and its relationship to compression in the context of the paper. Another user suggests reviewing the Ergotic theory and PAC learnability to gain a better understanding of the topic.

There is a comment providing a direct link to the paper on arXiv, which is hosted on the HuggingFace website.
