### Ink and Switch Constraint System (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/phase-2-constraint-system/) | 87 points | by [mpweiher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpweiher) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729932)

In the ever-evolving world of computational models, the dynamic medium of constraint systems is taking center stage, particularly in the innovative project relax-pk. This initiative, unfolding in the fall of 2023, is addressing the notoriously difficult task of implementing reliable and effective constraint systems, a venture with the potential to revolutionize how algorithms interact with mechanical constructions and computational models alike.

At the outset of phase 2, uncertainty loomed over how to best harness constraints, as they have historically been plagued by issues like "floaty-ness," where parameter changes cause unrealistic drifts, and "blow-ups," which result in system instability. However, early optimism has led to breakthroughs that promise to overcome these challenges. By reducing the dimensionality of problems and employing techniques like clustering, which segments constraints into smaller, independently solvable clusters, they’ve paved the way for more efficient and stable solutions.

The efforts have already yielded tangible results, such as eliminating the disorienting effects of duplicate states and preventing system "blow-ups" even when constraints are unevenly applied. Another exciting development is their successful use of equality constraints to simplify the solver’s workload. For example, they cleverly handle duplicate variables—like angle constraints presented in both radians and degrees—by collapsing them to a single variable internally, thus smoothing out the computational process.

Moreover, by tapping into different solvers, such as relaxation-based and gradient descent-based approaches, and reframing value representation from cartesian to polar coordinates, performance and convergence have seen significant enhancements. This is pushing the boundaries toward a future where constraint systems not only simulate real-world mechanics more accurately but also open up new possibilities for interactive and responsive computational models.

With potential advancements from community innovations like Avi Bryant's auto-diff and WebAssembly-powered solvers, relax-pk stands on the brink of bringing a new level of sophistication to how we conceive and interact with constraints. This heralds an exciting trajectory for dynamic media, where computational models become as intuitive and responsive as the physical world they emulate.

The Hacker News discussion around the relax-pk constraint-solving project highlights both enthusiasm for its potential and references to related tools and challenges. Key points include:

1. **Existing Tools & Comparisons**:  
   - Users mentioned lightweight CAD programs (e.g., SolveSpace, Dune 3D) and their inherent constraint solvers, noting their strengths but also scalability limitations in complex designs.

### OpenAI's new reasoning AI models hallucinate more

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/) | 114 points | by [almog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=almog) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43732506)

OpenAI recently unveiled its latest reasoning AI models, o3 and o4-mini, which have set new benchmarks in terms of performance in coding and math tasks. However, the models are facing a significant challenge: increased hallucination rates. Hallucinations refer to the models fabricating information or outcomes, and unfortunately, o3 and o4-mini exhibit higher hallucination rates compared to their predecessors. The issue is pronounced, with o3 hallucinating responses to 33% of the questions on OpenAI's PersonQA benchmark and o4-mini faring worse at 48%.

This development is surprising and concerning, as newly developed models usually offer improvements over previous versions. Despite their superior capabilities in certain areas, o3 and o4-mini make more inaccurate claims alongside correct ones, a phenomenon exacerbated by their tendency to generate more claims overall. Testing by third-party AI research lab Transluce indicates that o3 even fabricates processes, such as pretending to execute code on a device it doesn't have access to.

The implications of these findings are profound, especially in industries where precision is vital. While the creative aspects of hallucinations might be seen as innovative thinking, they can render models unreliable for sectors like law, where facts are non-negotiable. One proposed solution to tackle hallucination rates involves enhancing models with web search capabilities, which has proven effective with OpenAI’s GPT-4o, achieving higher accuracy on some benchmarks.

The increase in hallucinations reflects a broader challenge within the AI industry as it increasingly pivots towards reasoning models, which are supposed to offer better performance without extensive computing resources. Yet, as OpenAI's spokesperson Niko Felix emphasizes, reducing hallucinations remains a priority in their ongoing research to improve model accuracy and reliability.

The issue highlights the urgent need for solutions as the industry continues to strive for models that are not only intelligent but also trustworthy.

The Hacker News discussion on OpenAI's new models (o3 and o4-mini) and their hallucination issues highlights several key themes:

### **Examples of Hallucinations**
- Users shared instances where the models fabricated details, such as inventing **EXIF metadata** (e.g., GPS coordinates, timestamps) for a photo analysis task, despite lacking access to the data. One user noted the model even pretended to execute code on a nonexistent device.
- **GPT-4** was criticized for citing irrelevant sources, like linking to a completely unrelated Stack Overflow post when answering a technical question.

### **Technical Analysis of Reasoning Flaws**
- Participants compared the models’ reasoning to **"plausible-sounding bullshit"**, where step-by-step logic appears coherent but leads to incorrect conclusions. This mirrors human tendencies to rationalize flawed reasoning.
- Some speculated that **token-based reasoning** (e.g., "confidence tokens" in model outputs) might create an illusion of validity, even when conclusions are unfounded.

### **Training and Reward Model Critiques**
- A recurring argument centered on **reinforcement learning (RL)** shortcomings. Users suggested reward functions prioritize "correct-sounding" answers over truthfulness, incentivizing confident but inaccurate responses.
- One user likened the issue to a **"Hamiltonian course"**—models optimize for high scores (user satisfaction) rather than factual accuracy.

### **User Experiences and Implications**
- Developers reported erratic behavior, such as ChatGPT suddenly recommending obscure JavaScript libraries (e.g., *Scrawl-canvas*) over standard tools, raising concerns about reliability in coding contexts.
- Hallucinations in **geolocation tasks** (e.g., guessing photo locations) highlighted risks in real-world applications, where models might ignore physical evidence (like EXIF data) in favor of speculative reasoning.

### **Proposed Solutions and Comparisons**
- **External verification** (e.g., web searches, as used in GPT-4o) and **improved training data** were suggested to ground outputs in reality.
- Some praised **Claude** and **DeepSeek-R1** for better reasoning transparency, hinting that models should "show their work" to allow users to validate logic.
- Calls for **truthfulness-focused reward models** and penalizing hallucinations during RL training emerged as a priority.

### **Broader Concerns**
- Users expressed frustration with **flip-flopping answers** and models mirroring user biases instead of adhering to facts. For example, a discussion about Raspberry Pi’s affordability led the model to contradict itself based on conversational context.
- Skepticism persists about whether current AI research prioritizes **"actual reasoning"** over superficial performance benchmarks.

In summary, the community underscores the tension between creativity and reliability in AI, advocating for structural changes in training paradigms and validation mechanisms to address hallucination risks.

### SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds Using Neural Variational Heat Distances

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212) | 38 points | by [haxiomic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haxiomic) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729063)

Today on Hacker News, an intriguing mathematical paper has surfaced that might just reshape our understanding of surface reconstruction technology. Presented by a team of researchers including Samuel Weidemaier and Martin Rumpf, the study introduces a fresh variational approach for generating neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) from unoriented point clouds, a common data form in 3D modeling.

Traditionally, distance computations on discrete surfaces utilize an eikonal equation. However, this paper shifts the paradigm by leveraging the heat method, a technique familiar in discrete surface processing, but new to the neural domain. This innovative approach leads to two convex optimization problems solved using neural networks. First, a neural approximation of the unsigned distance field's gradients is calculated using a strategically timed heat flow. This output then provides the basis for accurately computing the final SDF.

The researchers assert the well-posed nature of the underlying variational problems they're tackling. Through extensive numerical experiments, they demonstrated that this method not only achieves state-of-the-art surface reconstruction but also yields consistent SDF gradients. Impressively, the proposed framework's accuracy shows potential for solving partial differential equations on the zero-level surface—a mark of its precision and utility.

This 14-page paper, packed with figures and tables, crosses the fields of Numerical Analysis, Graphics, and Machine Learning. It's poised to enrich our computational toolbox, especially for those engaged in detailed 3D rendering and modeling tasks. Dive into the full paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212) to explore this groundbreaking method further.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the neural SDF paper:

1. **Initial Reactions**  
   - User **RobotCaleb** humorously posts "fst" (likely shorthand for "first!"), a common forum meme to claim being the first commenter.  

2. **Technical Insights**

### Discord's face scanning age checks 'start of a bigger shift'

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr75wypg0vo) | 295 points | by [1659447091](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=1659447091) | [366 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43715884)

In a move that's causing quite a stir, Discord is testing facial recognition software to verify the ages of some users in the UK and Australia. This initiative comes in response to the UK’s upcoming online safety laws, which require platforms hosting adult content to implement strong age verification measures by July. Technology experts suggest this shift is just the beginning of a broader trend toward enhanced verification processes online.

Matt Navarra, a social media expert, describes age assurance as “the new seatbelt for the internet,” stating that platforms failing to implement effective age checks risk losing users and facing legal consequences. Companies like Instagram have already paved the way by using AI to estimate user age through selfie videos, and Discord is following suit by offering users the choice of using a face scanner or photo ID for age verification.

The practice is not without controversy. Privacy advocates, including Big Brother Watch, argue that such technology presents risks, including potential security breaches and privacy intrusions. Despite these concerns, regulators and age verification bodies see a variety of methods available that they claim protect privacy and accurately estimate age.

Australia, on a parallel track, is moving towards banning social media for users under 16, noting that over 80% of children between 8 and 12 are already active on platforms meant for older users. This illustrates a global push for more stringent online safety protocols for younger internet users.

As these changes unfold, age verification becomes vital not just for user protection but as a critical compliance measure for companies facing significant financial penalties for non-compliance. This new era might signal the end of simple checkboxes confirming age, marking a profound evolution in how internet safety is managed.

Meanwhile, Discord is under pressure from legal fronts as well, with New Jersey's attorney general suing the company over alleged misleading safety controls. As the digital world adapts to new safety and privacy standards, the spotlight remains squarely on platforms like Discord and their handling of sensitive content access.

The discussion revolves around Discord's implementation of facial recognition for age verification and broader debates on online safety, privacy, and regulation. Key points include:

1. **Technical Challenges**:  
   Users highlight encryption technologies (TLS, DoH, ECH) as barriers to content filtering, making age verification technically complex. Critics argue that modern protocols and decentralized tools (VPNs, peer-to-peer networks) render traditional filtering methods ineffective, allowing minors to bypass restrictions.

2. **Legal and Regulatory Debates**:  
   References to the 1998 Child Online Protection Act (COPA) and its overturning by the Supreme Court underscore historical tensions between regulation and free speech. Skepticism persists about new laws, with users questioning their enforceability and potential to create privacy risks (e.g., biometric data breaches).

3. **Parental vs. Governmental Responsibility**:  
   Some argue that parents, not governments or platforms, should oversee children’s online activity. Critics of strict regulation warn of "Orwellian" surveillance, while others advocate for client-side filtering tools or movements like "Wait Until 8th" (delaying smartphones until age 14). Schools’ struggles to manage device use in classrooms also reflect broader societal challenges.

4. **Privacy Concerns**:  
   Facial recognition and biometric verification are criticized as invasive, with fears that data could be exploited by third parties or governments. Comparisons are drawn to past privacy failures, such as Google’s anonymized data being re-identified.

5. **Societal and Cultural Shifts**:  
   Discussions note the normalization of early tech exposure, with children accessing explicit content despite restrictions. Some users emphasize social pressures and the difficulty of controlling peer-driven behavior, while others blame lax parenting or cultural individualism.

6. **Skepticism Toward Solutions**:  
   Age verification is seen as a flawed "check-the-box" compliance measure, unlikely to deter determined minors. Critics suggest the focus should shift to education and harm reduction rather than unenforceable bans.

The conversation reflects a clash between technological feasibility, privacy rights, and the practicality of regulating online behavior, with no clear consensus on effective solutions.

### Differentiable Programming from Scratch

#### [Submission URL](https://thenumb.at/Autodiff/) | 101 points | by [sksxihve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sksxihve) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43713140)

Differentiable programming is revolutionizing various fields well beyond machine learning. While systems like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX have propelled its use in machine learning, this approach is now making waves in areas like computer graphics with innovations such as differentiable rendering, differentiable physics, and neural representations. Recognized in 3Blue1Brown’s Summer of Math Exposition 2, a recent article sheds light on this increasingly vital tool for tackling complex optimization problems.

To grasp differentiable programming, one must revisit key mathematical concepts starting with differentiation. The derivative, a staple of calculus, measures how a function's output changes with a tiny input variation. For instance, in one-dimensional functions, it represents the function's slope at a given point.

However, in higher dimensions, this concept transforms: the derivative becomes a map turning input vectors into output vectors. Take a function of two variables, for instance, which yields partial derivatives that together form the gradient—a vector indicating the direction of steepest ascent.

Understanding these mathematical underpinnings is crucial for implementing differentiable programming techniques effectively. Moreover, with the advent of automatic differentiation methods like forward and backward modes, programming for differentiation has become more streamlined, enabling applications such as image de-blurring and other optimization tasks in coding.

Differentiable programming is also about managing how function compositions are differentiated, employing the chain rule to handle more complex functions. When diving deeper, differentiable programming involves augmenting numerical and symbolic differentiation with sophisticated automatic differentiation techniques.

This expansion into various scientific and technological domains underscores the potential and importance of differentiable programming. As these methodologies continue to evolve and find new applications, they promise to further enhance our ability to solve intricate problems across disciplines.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Differentiable Programming:**

The discussion highlights the historical roots, technical challenges, and modern debates surrounding differentiable programming (DP) and automatic differentiation (AD). Key points include:

1. **Historical Context**:  
   - DP/AD is not new; its foundations trace back to the 1960s–1990s, with early work in FORTRAN, contributions by Louis Rall (1981), and Andreas Griewank (2000). Critics note that modern ML/AI researchers often overlook or fail to cite this prior work, leading to concerns about academic integrity and "reinventing the wheel."

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **Numerical Stability**: Finite-difference methods face instability in high-dimensional spaces, with risks of catastrophic cancellation and computational infeasibility.  
   - **State and Purity**: AD requires functions to be "pure" (stateless) for reliable differentiation. Managing stateful variables or dynamic control flow (e.g., loops with variable iterations) complicates derivative calculations.  
   - **Compositionality**: Chain-rule applications in complex functions can fail if components violate derivative rules (e.g., adversarial compositions), though certain cases (eigenvalue derivatives) remain valid if phase choices are consistent.

3. **Language and Implementation**:  
   - AD can be integrated into existing languages (e.g., JavaScript, F#’s DiffSharp) without needing new domain-specific languages (DSLs). Functional programming paradigms simplify AD due to their emphasis on purity, but challenges persist in handling mutable state or optimizing memory in reverse-mode AD.  
   - Some argue that "differentiable programming" is more about augmenting existing systems with AD tools rather than inventing entirely new frameworks.

4. **Critique of Modern Research**:  
   - Participants criticize the ML community for neglecting historical literature, with anecdotes of researchers repackaging old ideas without proper attribution. This underscores a broader tension between rapid innovation and academic rigor.

In summary, while differentiable programming is driving advances in ML and beyond, the discussion emphasizes its deep historical roots, persistent technical hurdles, and the need for greater acknowledgment of foundational work.

In an intriguing leap towards smarter sports analysis, Gainline, a rugby-centric app, is navigating the challenge of providing deeper insights into rugby games. While existing data covers the major events like tries and cards, it falls short in explaining why they happen. This gap in context is critical for fans who crave a more immersive second-screen experience.

The team behind Gainline embarked on an innovative journey to address this challenge—by developing a prototype AI capable of watching rugby games and extracting rich, contextual data directly from the visuals. The prototype hinges on OpenAI's vision model, which analyzes screenshots taken every five seconds from game footage. This AI doesn't just tell us who scored; it deciphers phases of play, game time, and team kits, restructuring them into readily usable data formats like JSON.

One of the primary experiments involved efficiently extracting key information like scores and game times. Instead of sending the model full-resolution screenshots (a costly endeavor), the team cleverly reduced the data size by cropping images to just focus on the scoreboard, a practical solution that significantly cut down on computational costs without needing fanciful image processing methods.

To add efficiency, an intriguing "diffing" method was contemplated—comparing frames to isolate and identify changes, like the scoreboard, using basic image comparison techniques. While still a work in progress, these minimalist approaches exemplify the project's ethos of simplicity over complexity.

This initiative opens a new horizon for rugby fans, promising rich narratives woven from AI-generated insights.

### Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without All the Bullshit (2015)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.jeremykun.com/2015/04/06/markov-chain-monte-carlo-without-all-the-bullshit/) | 221 points | by [ibobev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ibobev) | [48 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43700633)

If you've ever tried to wade through the jargon-riddled waters of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), you might find yourself wishing for a more straightforward guide to help you make sense of it all. Thankfully, a popular Hacker News article titled "Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without all the Bullshit" does just that, peeling back the layers of complexity to reveal the heart of the method.

At its core, MCMC is a powerful tool for sampling from complex probability distributions when direct sampling is challenging. Imagine trying to draw a baby name from a magical list according to your specific preferences. Armed only with a mysterious black-box function that can output the probability of each name, you find yourself facing the daunting task of efficiently drawing names in accordance with these probabilities—this is where MCMC steps in.

The trick lies in the clever use of something called a Markov chain, a type of random walk on a graph. Picture this: you have a set of names, and each name has links to others, with each link carrying a probability of transitioning from one name to another. By wandering through this network according to the probabilities on these connections, you create a chain of names that mimics the distribution you're aiming for.

This practical breakdown strips away the esoteric language often associated with MCMC, making it accessible to those less acquainted with statistical gobbledygook. With just fair random coins and a bit of patience, you can simulate these intricate processes and glean accurate estimates—whether you're calculating averages or deciphering the cryptic distributions in some Bayesian network.

Ultimately, this approachable explanation invites readers to see beyond the smokescreen of technical symbols and interpret MCMC as a beautifully simple—yet profoundly effective—tool in the ever-evolving field of data science.

The Hacker News discussion on the article "Markov Chain Monte Carlo Without all the Bullshit" revolves around the balance between simplifying complex concepts and maintaining technical accuracy. Here's a concise summary:

### Key Debates & Insights:

   While the article’s analogy of MCMC as a "fancy random walk on a graph" was praised for accessibility, some users argued it risked oversimplification. Critics like *low_tech_love* and *gh02t* noted that intuitive explanations can obscure critical details (e.g., MCMC’s theoretical complexity, assumptions about state spaces), potentially misleading beginners. However, others defended the value of building conceptual understanding before diving into formalism.

2. **Markov Property & Random Walks**:  
   A technical debate emerged about whether random walks on graphs inherently satisfy the **Markov property** (memorylessness). *snhntr* questioned if path-dependent walks (e.g., avoiding revisited nodes) violate the property, while *JohnKemeny* cited Yale lecture notes defining graph-based random walks as Markov processes. The discussion highlighted nuances in terminology, such as discrete vs. continuous state spaces and time dependencies.

3. **Practical MCMC Considerations**:  
   Users like *bjrnsng* emphasized that MCMC relies on constructing Markov chains with specific **graph properties** (e.g., reachability, aperiodicity) to ensure convergence to a stationary distribution. This ties the theory to practical implementation challenges.

4. **Broader Context**:  
   *gryct* expanded the scope, citing examples like Poisson processes in chemistry and WWII search theory to illustrate diverse applications of stochastic processes, underscoring the need for precise definitions beyond basic Markov chains.

### Conclusion:  
The thread reflects a common tension in technical education: balancing clarity with rigor. While the article’s approach was applauded for demystifying MCMC, the discussion stressed the importance of contextualizing simplifications and acknowledging underlying complexities for deeper understanding.

### Microsoft researchers developed a hyper-efficient AI model that can run on CPUs

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/16/microsoft-researchers-say-theyve-developed-a-hyper-efficient-ai-model-that-can-run-on-cpus/) | 136 points | by [libpcap](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=libpcap) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43711227)

Microsoft has unveiled BitNet b1.58 2B4T, a groundbreaking AI model claimed to be the most efficient 1-bit AI model—or "bitnet"—ever developed. This model, which is open-source under an MIT license, is optimized to run on standard CPUs, including Apple’s M2, without the need for powerful GPUs. The secret to its efficiency lies in its design: bitnets compress model weights into just three values—-1, 0, 1—allowing them to execute rapidly with minimal memory usage.

Standing out with its 2 billion parameters, BitNet b1.58 2B4T was trained on an enormous dataset comprised of 4 trillion tokens, roughly equivalent to 33 million books. Against fierce competition, it performs admirably, outpacing counterparts like Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B and Google’s Gemma 3 1B on benchmarks testing math and physical commonsense reasoning skills. Notably, it performs these feats at speeds double that of rival models while using less memory.

Despite these advances, there’s a catch: the model requires Microsoft’s proprietary bitnet.cpp framework and certain specific hardware, excluding the prevalent GPUs.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Microsoft's BitNet b1.58 2B4T:**

1. **Technical Design & Efficiency**  
   - The model’s 1.58-bit ternary weights (-1, 0, 1) drew attention, with users clarifying that the name stems from log₂(3) ≈ 1.58 bits, a mathematical trick for compact representation. However, some questioned if labeling it "1-bit" was oversimplified.  
   - Efficiency gains were highlighted: faster CPU inference (doubling competitors’ speeds) and reduced memory (1GB size), though benchmarks comparing it to FP16/BF16 models were debated.  

2. **Performance Comparisons**  
   - Users noted BitNet’s 2B parameters and 4T-token training dataset rival Meta’s Llama 3 and Google’s Gemma in math/commonsense tasks, but skepticism arose over claims of "outperforming" larger models. Some argued parameter count isn’t the sole factor, emphasizing quality and token diversity.  

3. **Hardware & Compatibility**  
   - While optimized for CPUs (even Apple M2/M3), reliance on Microsoft’s proprietary **bitnet.cpp** framework and lack of GPU support were criticized. Users pointed out existing 1–2B models (e.g., Mistral, Llama) already run well on CPUs, questioning BitNet’s unique advantage.  
   - GPU-centric workflows remain dominant; Nvidia’s CUDA ecosystem and Apple’s focus on consumer hardware (vs. data centers) were cited as barriers to adoption.  

4. **Open Source & Adoption Challenges**  
   - MIT licensing is a plus, but dependency on Microsoft’s framework might limit integration. Skepticism arose about real-world use, with users highlighting frameworks like `llama.cpp` as more flexible alternatives.  

5. **Broader Industry Implications**  
   - Some speculated BitNet could spur specialized low-power hardware (e.g., ASICs) or democratize AI for edge devices, though others dismissed this, noting Nvidia’s entrenched position and the difficulty of displacing GPU-centric infrastructure.  
   - Humorous takes included jabs at Microsoft’s naming conventions ("BitNet" vs. ".NET") and past ventures (e.g., Skype), alongside debates about corporate monopolies.  

6. **Technical Deep Dives**  
   - Users linked to the original BitNet papers, clarifying its evolution from binary (-1/1) to ternary weights. Lookup tables and SIMD optimizations were discussed as key to its speed.  
   - Critiques emerged about post-training quantization vs. quantization-aware training, with BitNet’s approach seen as novel but requiring further validation.  

**Key Takeaways**: BitNet’s CPU efficiency and compact design are promising, but its reliance on Microsoft’s ecosystem and unclear edge over existing models leave adoption uncertain. The discussion reflects broader tensions in AI between hardware optimization, open-source flexibility, and corporate control.
