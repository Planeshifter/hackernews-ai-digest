This is a staggering improvement compared to existing models that take much longer to create just a single second of video. The architecture behind this innovation leverages decoupled spatial autoencoders and latent diffusion backbones, ensuring stability and scalability.

The project not only showcases technical prowess but opens up an exciting future where games could be controlled entirely through text or audio, potentially redefining interactivity in gaming. Oasis is now available to explore, complete with code and a live demo, giving developers and gamers alike a glimpse into the potential of AI-powered realities. With ongoing research and plans for future enhancements, Oasis represents a significant step towards the next generation of AI-driven gaming experiences.

In the discussion surrounding Decart's AI-driven gaming project "Oasis," a variety of perspectives emerged regarding the technical aspects and implications of the technology. Some commenters expressed skepticism about how immersive and consistent the gaming experience could be, given that the AI-generated environments may lack stability and continuity over extended play sessions. Concerns about potential legal implications, such as copyright issues connected to works resembling existing games like Minecraft, were also prominently discussed, highlighting the need to navigate intellectual property laws carefully. 

Others pointed out the unique potential for user interactivity, emphasizing how the AI could enable incredibly dynamic and personalized experiences in gaming. There was mention of generating worlds in real-time through text or voice commands, which aligns with the vision for a next-generation gaming experience. Some contributors noted the challenges of scaling AI models to maintain the quality of gameplay while ensuring efficient resource requirements, especially as user interactions become more complex.

Additionally, the conversation touched on the broader implications of AI in game development, including the ethical considerations of utilizing AI-generated content and the responsibilities of creators in acknowledging original sources. Overall, while the excitement surrounding "Oasis" was palpable, there were significant discussions regarding the technical viability, legal ramifications, and ethical considerations in the evolving landscape of AI-driven gaming.

### Apple silently uploads your passwords and keeps them

#### [Submission URL](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/2024/10/4.html) | 158 points | by [ingve](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ingve) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42014588)

A recent blog post has revealed a troubling quirk in Apple's iCloud Keychain feature that may leave users unaware of their data being uploaded and stored. The author details their experience upgrading from macOS Ventura to Sonoma, during which iCloud Keychain was enabled without their consent. Shockingly, after disabling the feature, they discovered that passwords had already been uploaded to iCloud, a fact obscured because iCloud Keychain must be turned on to view its contents.

Despite their intention to keep personal data off iCloud, the user's passwords were ultimately synced across devices due to a silent activation of iCloud Keychain during the upgrade process. They uncovered that disabling iCloud Keychain does not remove the stored data from Apple's servers, raising concerns about the privacy and permanence of what users thought they had deleted. 

After manual deletion of passwords and further experimentation, the user found a workaround that kept their Mac mini iCloud Keychain-free. However, they remain anxious about other potential data lingering in iCloud, such as Wi-Fi passwords. This situation has sparked significant discussions about user control over personal information in Apple's ecosystem and highlights potential flaws in Apple's data management policies.

The discussion surrounding the blog post about the Apple iCloud Keychain issue reflects a mix of frustration and concern among users over data privacy and control. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Silent Activation**: Users expressed alarm that iCloud Keychain could be activated silently during system updates, leading to unintended syncing of passwords without users' knowledge. Many felt their choices were undermined by this default behavior.
2. **Data Permanence**: There was significant anxiety over the inability to completely remove stored data from iCloud once it had been synced. This raised questions about what happens to deleted data and whether users ever truly regain control over their personal information.
3. **Alternative Solutions**: Some users brought up alternatives to iCloud Keychain, such as third-party password managers, emphasizing the need for more user-controlled and privacy-focused options. They discussed concerns about the implications of syncing credentials across devices without explicit consent.
4. **Technical Limitations**: Several commenters noted technical issues, such as problems with syncing passwords on Windows machines and the complexities of managing passwords across different ecosystems (e.g., Apple vs. Windows).
5. **General Distrust**: There was a broader theme of distrust toward major tech companies like Apple, especially regarding their handling of user data and consent. This distrust was fueled by the experiences shared in the thread, where users felt misled or forced into using services they would have otherwise opted out of.

Overall, the discussion highlighted deep concerns about user privacy in the tech landscape and the need for greater transparency and control over personal data.
