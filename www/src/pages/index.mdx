#### [Submission URL](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/05/20/1116327/ai-energy-usage-climate-footprint-big-tech/) | 278 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [309 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44039808)

We all turn to AI daily, whether for homework help, creating art, or generating videos. But have you ever wondered about the energy it takes to power this AI revolution? MIT Technology Review's latest analysis unveils the staggering energy demands behind every AI query, raising questions about the industry's transparency and future impact on our power grids.

AI's energy footprint isn't just about simple queries; it's about a colossal infrastructure shift. Tech giants like Meta and Microsoft are investing heavily in energy projects, with initiatives as ambitious as new nuclear power plants and expansive data centers, each potentially consuming more power than the entire state of New Hampshire.

The AI energy story is part of a broader narrative. While data centers once maintained steady electricity usage through improved efficiencies, the rise of AI has doubled their consumption since 2017. Currently, they're responsible for 4.4% of the US's power usage, and it's projected that by 2028, over half of the electricity to data centers will fuel AI.

Alarmingly, as AI's reach grows—promising personalized services and complex problem-solving—the environmental toll is set to rise. Many AI operations run on more carbon-intensive energy as they quickly scale operations, leaving significant emissions behind. Predictions suggest that AI could eventually consume as much power annually as nearly a quarter of US households.

This energy surge comes amidst calls for transparency. Critics argue that the lack of detailed energy data from AI companies obscures effective planning for future demands and emissions. With AI models inching toward being the fifth-most visited online service globally, the stakes are high, not just for tech companies but for utility providers and governments worldwide.

Ultimately, navigating AI's unchecked energy demands will require a delicate balancing act—making AI’s consumption visible, equitable, and sustainable as we step into this new techno-future.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy consumption reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Energy Concerns & Environmental Impact**:  
   Users express alarm over AI's growing energy demands, with comparisons to carbon-intensive activities like "rolling coal" (intentionally emitting diesel smoke). Some note that generating a single AI query (0.3–40 Wh) pales next to the environmental cost of such practices (10,000–100,000+ grams of CO2). However, critics argue AI's rapid scaling could still strain grids and worsen emissions.

2. **Tech Industry Transparency**:  
   Skepticism arises about tech giants (Meta, Google, etc.) not disclosing detailed energy data, complicating efforts to quantify AI's true footprint. Some users highlight initiatives like nuclear power investments but question their feasibility and timelines.

3. **Carbon Tax Debates**:  
   A contentious thread debates carbon taxes. Proponents argue they incentivize green tech, while opponents call them regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income groups. Revenue-neutral models (e.g., Canada’s rebate system) are discussed, though criticized as misunderstood or politically unpopular.

4. **AI Efficiency vs. Benefits**:  
   While some defend AI’s energy use as justified by societal benefits (e.g., education, problem-solving), others counter that unchecked growth risks outweighing gains. Technical users dissect energy metrics, comparing model sizes (e.g., DeepSeek’s 600B parameters) and query efficiency.

5. **Side Discussions**:  
   - Humor and typos: Lighthearted exchanges about comment typos and ChatGPT’s role in everyday tasks.  
   - Practical solutions: Offshore wind, nuclear, and distributed data centers are proposed, though latency concerns for AI applications are noted.  
   - Cultural critiques: Jabs at "rolling coal" as a symbol of anti-environmental sentiment contrast with calls for systemic policy changes.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores a tension between AI’s transformative potential and its environmental cost, with calls for transparency, equitable policy, and sustainable innovation to balance progress and planetary limits.

#### [Submission URL](https://zackproser.com/blog/openai-codex-review) | 150 points | by [fragmede](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fragmede) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44042070)

Imagine having an assistant that manages all your Git projects effortlessly, allowing you to focus on the bigger picture while it handles the boring details. This is precisely the vision of Codex, OpenAI's innovative platform that promises a seamless integration with GitHub to boost your productivity. However, like any tech in its early days, it’s not quite there yet.

Codex is a chat-focused tool that, once you're in, requires multi-factor authentication and some setup over at GitHub. It clones your repositories into its special sandboxes, letting you execute commands and create branches without ever leaving the interface. This setup means if you manage lots of repos, it feels like a powerhouse. But, if you're working on just one or two, it might feel like an overkill compared to a simple AI editor like Cursor.

One of the standout features of Codex is its multi-threaded approach. If you’re someone who dreams of launching your tasks in parallel and letting the code compile while you enjoy a peaceful walk in nature, Codex might be up your alley. You can toss various tasks at it, follow up via chats, check logs, and even let it handle opening pull requests for your features.

The platform isn't without its quirks, though. It struggles a bit with error handling and tends to open new pull requests for every little change, rather than allowing smooth updates to existing ones. Plus, shout out to all you devs: Codex doesn't brave the internet to solve dependency woes just yet, leaving you to handle them locally.

As for whether Codex supercharges productivity? Not exactly, not yet. But the potential is undeniably there. Once it improves multi-tasking, branch updates, and extends its integration capabilities—perhaps by weaving in more of OpenAI's platform goodies—it could well become the dream tool many devs have been waiting for. Until then, Codex serves as a promising glimpse into a more orchestrated future of software development, where a robust digital assistant truly changes the game.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion reflects mixed reactions to OpenAI's Codex, with users highlighting both potential and significant limitations:  

1. **Frustrations with Codex's UX and Reliability**:  
   - Users report a clunky setup process, unstable GitHub integration (disconnects/errors), and "blank screens" during use.  
   - Environment limitations (e.g., no container support, internet access) hinder resolving dependencies or running tests.  
   - Some compare it unfavorably to alternatives like **Cursor** (simpler for smaller projects) or **Claude/Gemini** (better context handling).  

2. **Workflow Successes and Challenges**:  
   - Parallel task execution and iterative prompting can yield results, especially for mid-sized projects, but require meticulous prompt tuning.  
   - Git integration is criticized: Codex auto-opens excessive PRs for minor changes and struggles with commit rollbacks.  

3. **Debates About LLMs Replacing Developers**:  
   - Non-technical users leveraging Codex to replace engineers is deemed exaggerated.  
   - Many argue that **problem-solving** and **system design skills** remain irreplaceable, even if LLMs automate code generation. Skeptics link to articles questioning AI’s readiness to replace skilled roles.  

4. **Practical Tradeoffs**:  
   - Codex can save time on boilerplate tasks but demands oversight to avoid “AI-generated spaghetti code.”  
   - Developers emphasize that **terminal/CLI proficiency**, debugging, and understanding frameworks remain critical barriers for non-technical users.  

**Verdict**: While Codex shows promise for parallel task management and code generation, its current limitations in UX, environment flexibility, and workflow maturity make it feel like a “half-baked” tool. Users agree it’s not yet a productivity game-changer but could evolve with better error handling, branch management, and deeper integration with OpenAI’s ecosystem. The broader discussion underscores skepticism about AI replacing developers but acknowledges its role in augmenting workflows—*if* the technical hurdles are addressed.

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/15424968) | 83 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44041515)

The European Lisp Symposium has unveiled an intriguing development in the realm of programming languages with "The Lisp in the Cellar." Researchers Pierre-Evariste Dagand and Frederic Peschanski have introduced the Deputy system, a Clojure-hosted programming language boasting dependent types. This cutting-edge system allows developers to partake in type-level computation intertwined with interactive programming, leveraging the dynamic Lisp-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Despite its dynamic approach to types, Deputy ensures all type-checking is completed during compile-time, combining the flexibility of Lisp with the rigors of dependently-typed logic.

The uniqueness of Deputy lies in its seamless integration into Clojure, thus allowing developers to remain within familiar territory when transitioning to type-level programming. Presented at the 18th European Lisp Symposium in Zurich, this research holds potential to reshape how the programming community approaches type systems, making it a significant contribution to the ongoing evolution of software development methodologies.

For those interested in diving deeper, the full paper is accessible on Zenodo under a Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives 4.0 International license. So far, it has garnered an impressive amount of attention with over 11,000 views and nearly 10,000 downloads, indicating its substantial impact and growing interest within the tech community.

### The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/akarshkumar0101/fer) | 52 points | by [akarshkumar0101](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=akarshkumar0101) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44043034)

In an intriguing development in the field of artificial intelligence, a position paper titled "The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis" has sparked discussions on Hacker News. Authored by a team from prestigious institutions like MIT, University of British Columbia, and University of Oxford, the paper delves into how neural networks internally construct their outputs. Specifically, it juxtaposes the conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training method with networks evolved through an open-ended search process on task as simple as generating a single image. 

The study yields fascinating insights—while both methods achieve similar output behaviors, their internal neuron representations significantly differ. Networks trained via SGD exhibit what the authors call a "fractured entangled representation" (FER), which might hamper abilities like generalization and creativity. In contrast, evolved networks tend toward a more organized representation structure. This distinction could have profound implications for advancing AI's ability to learn continuously.

The released repository on GitHub provides code and supplementary data, enabling enthusiasts and researchers to analyze, reproduce, and visualize these findings. For those interested, the project includes a Google Colab notebook for easy exploration and a contact link for further inquiries or to access additional Picbreeder genomes. To cite this work, there's even a ready-to-go BibTeX entry.

This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that better performance inherently means better internal representations, opening up new avenues for research in AI representation learning.

   - Users contrast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with evolutionary/open-ended search processes. Some suggest biologically plausible forward-forward algorithms might yield more interpretable representations.  
   - Evolved networks’ structured representations are seen as advantageous for generalization, while SGD’s "fractured entangled" representations (FER) may hinder creativity and robustness.  

2. **Interpretability Challenges**  
   - Skepticism arises about linear methods (e.g., PCA, linear probes) for analyzing neural networks. Critics argue these tools fail to capture the complexity of entangled representations, with references to Neel Nanda’s Othello experiments and sparse autoencoders (SAEs).  
   - Debates emerge over whether linear transformations or rotational matrices can "untangle" latent spaces, with some users questioning the practicality of such approaches.  

3. **Criticisms and Practical Implications**  
   - A user dismisses the paper’s findings as "worthless," arguing that subjective preferences for "beautiful" mathematical representations don’t predict network efficacy. Others counter that structured representations (e.g., via weight decay regularization) improve model performance, especially in deeper layers.  
   - Concerns about the AI research field’s focus on scaling existing systems rather than fundamental breakthroughs are raised, alongside calls for more "high-throughput thinking" to address core challenges.  

4. **Side Discussions**  
   - A meta-debate occurs about Hacker News guidelines, with users discussing whether linking to the paper and a related tweet violates community rules. Some defend the inclusion as valuable context.  

**Key References Mentioned**:  
- Neel Nanda’s work on linear representation hypotheses in language models.

Nick McGreivy, a recent Princeton PhD graduate and plasma physicist, has candidly shared his journey with AI in scientific research, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). McGreivy initially embraced the AI-for-science hype, motivated by its potential to revolutionize physics and its appealing career opportunities. However, he soon discovered that many AI methods, despite being lauded in numerous studies, often underperform compared to traditional numerical techniques when properly evaluated.

McGreivy’s key focus was on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a novel AI approach to solving PDEs that promised superior speed and efficiency. Yet, his experiments led to disappointing results, revealing that AI solutions were not the unparalleled breakthroughs they were claimed to be. He found that the advantages of AI methods often disappeared under rigorous, fair comparisons with state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

This experience, and others like it, have fueled skepticism about AI’s transformative impact on scientific progress. High-profile AI claims, such as DeepMind's controversial work on crystal structures, have been criticized for overstating their contributions. Furthermore, pervasive issues like data leakage in AI research raise concerns about validity and reproducibility, casting doubt on the real impact of AI breakthroughs.

Despite these challenges, AI adoption in research is rapidly increasing across various fields. Yet, McGreivy warns that this surge might reflect more on scientists' incentives and publication biases rather than genuine scientific advancement. AI's potential in science, while promising, may not be as revolutionary as anticipated, contributing more to gradual, incremental progress than ground-breaking discoveries.

Ultimately, McGreivy emphasizes that while AI remains a powerful tool for scientific inquiry, its adoption should be cautious and evidence-based, avoiding the pitfalls of sensationalism and unwarranted optimism. The path to scientific progress is complex, and AI's role in it is likely to be a supporting, rather than a leading, element.

### Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/akarshkumar0101/fer) | 43 points | by [mattdesl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mattdesl) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44038549)

In the world of AI and neural networks, a new position paper titled "The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis" is turning heads by challenging the conventional wisdom about neural network internal representations. Authored by researchers from institutions like MIT and the University of Oxford, the paper delves into how scaling up AI systems influences their inner workings, rather than just their performance outcomes.

The study compares traditional neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with those evolved via an open-ended search process, focusing on the task of generating a single image. This approach allows each neuron's function within the network to be visualized, offering a rare window into how these networks construct their outputs.

The findings reveal a stark difference between the two methods: SGD-trained networks often exhibit a disorganized structure, described as a "fractured entangled representation" (FER). This chaotic interior might hinder key capabilities like generalization and creativity. On the flip side, networks evolved through open-ended methods tend to sport more organized, unified representations.

This revelation raises important questions about the future of neural-network training approaches. Could managing or mitigating FER be crucial for advancing AI's representational capabilities?

For those interested in exploring the data and methodologies used in this research, the authors have shared their code on GitHub, complete with visualizations and supplementary data. It's a call to the community to dive deeper into understanding and possibly overcoming the limitations presented by FER, which might just be key to unlocking the more robust AI systems of tomorrow.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

1. **Interest and Critique of Conventional AI Approaches**:  
   Users highlight the paper’s significance for challenging the AI research community’s focus on scaling (e.g., model size, dataset size) and assuming larger/more data inherently leads to progress. Critics argue this “scale-first” mindset risks overemphasizing superficial metrics, especially in LLMs, at the cost of understanding how representations form internally.

2. **Fractured Representations and Generalization**:  
   The discussion emphasizes the paper’s argument that "fractured entangled representations" (FER) in SGD-trained networks might hinder generalization and creativity. This contrasts with open-evolved networks showing more coherent structures. A user questions how this applies practically to modern LLMs, speculating whether ad-hoc training methods inadvertently produce disorganized representations that limit reasoning or emergent capabilities.

3. **Calls for Deeper Investigation**:  
   Users debate whether LLMs truly build semantically organized representations or rely on statistical correlations, noting a need to analyze how training processes (e.g., SGD vs. open-ended search) shape internal structures. One user asks for concrete examples linking FER to real-world LLM behaviors (e.g., coding errors, summarization), but it’s clarified the paper doesn’t address this directly.

4. **Stylistic Reaction**:  
   A lighthearted comment mocks the paper’s complex title, reflecting broader tensions in how AI concepts are communicated.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion reveals enthusiasm for rethinking neural network training paradigms but underscores gaps in connecting theoretical hypotheses (like FER) to observed limitations in today's LLMs. Further empirical work is needed to determine whether addressing fractured representations could unlock new capabilities.

One user noted that LLMs struggle to follow E-Prime consistently without explicit prompting, suggesting the need for refined constraints to minimize hallucinations.  

2. **Truth and Bullshit Detection**: A deeper thread questioned how AI determines "truth," referencing Gödel’s incompleteness theorem and the subjectivity of truth in contexts like politics or conspiracy theories. Skepticism arose about AI’s ability to discern truth, with suggestions to focus on detecting established patterns of misinformation (e.g., "bullshit detection") rather than absolute truths.  

3. **Implementation Hurdles**: Users acknowledged the framework’s structured YAML configuration and role-based design as promising but raised concerns about cognitive load when enforcing E-Prime. Some proposed benchmarking to assess its effectiveness compared to standard LLM outputs.  

4. **Community Reception**: Comments ranged from enthusiasm ("Nice") to nuanced critiques, with appreciation for its literary inspiration and systematic approach. However, questions lingered about scalability and whether philosophical rigor translates to practical reliability.  

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about the framework’s potential, tempered by calls for empirical validation and deeper exploration of its epistemological assumptions.

### Spaced repetition memory system (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Spaced_repetition_memory_system) | 259 points | by [gasull](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gasull) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44022225)

In the realm of learning and memory enhancement, the power of spaced repetition systems (SRS) is gaining renewed attention. Originally brought into the public eye by Piotr Wozniak with the creation of Supermemo, SRS combines the Testing and Spacing effects to make memorization highly efficient. While traditionally associated with rote learning, these systems can also nurture conceptual understanding, shifting the perception that memory techniques only apply to straightforward fact memorization.

Exploring the landscape of spaced repetition, traditional tools like Supermemo, Mnemosyne, and Anki stand out. However, innovative variations are pushing the boundaries of application, extending from mnemonic aids like the Mnemonic medium and RemNote to specialized learning tools such as Chessable MoveTrainer and literary aids like Readwise.

Interestingly, the application of SRS isn’t just about programmed memorization. They can be crafted to encourage attention, prompt application and synthesis of knowledge, and even support unique tasks like catechism. These "memory systems"—a term some users prefer—are proving versatile.

Yet, challenges to the adoption and effective use of SRS abound. Writing effective prompts is a significant barrier, as prompts often need to resonate personally to achieve the best emotional and educational connection. Moreover, there's a cultural bias that undervalues memory's role in creative endeavors due to past negative experiences with rote learning.

Critics argue that SRS focus too heavily on mere fact retention, failing to allow for natural learning through engagement. Others believe learning should happen "by doing" rather than relying on systems that can often feel monotonous or disconnected from passionate pursuits.

Despite these criticisms, advocates note that when used effectively, SRS can automate rote elements of study, leaving room for deeper engagement and understanding. This is exemplified by stories of successful adaptations of SRS in diverse contexts, from childhood education to complex knowledge domains.

Ultimately, the conversation around SRS continues to evolve, as does the technology and community surrounding it, promising further breakthroughs in the ways we conceive memory and learning. Whether for memorization, conceptual growth, or beyond, spaced repetition remains a fascinating tool awaiting broader experimentation and refinement.

### Climbing trees 1: what are decision trees?

#### [Submission URL](https://mathpn.com/posts/climbing-trees-1/) | 42 points | by [SchwKatze](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=SchwKatze) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44018662)

Welcome to "Climbing Trees," a new series dedicated to demystifying decision trees in the world of machine learning! This first installment lays the groundwork by explaining what decision trees are and why they're fundamental to machine learning, often considered the go-to algorithm despite their simplicity and limitations.

Imagine yourself deciding whether to grab an umbrella before leaving the house: "Are there clouds?" "What's the humidity level?" This series of yes/no questions mimics the function of a decision tree. Each question, or node, splits the data into two paths, allowing us to make more informed choices as we progress down the tree towards a terminal node, which provides the final prediction.

In this post, you'll learn how decision trees are structured, their inner workings, and the difference between classification and regression trees. Classification trees categorize data into predefined classes, like predicting whether it will rain, while regression trees predict continuous numerical outcomes, such as estimating house prices.

The beauty of decision trees lies in their simplicity and interpretability. Unlike black-box models, decision trees let us trace back each decision path, providing an easily understandable explanation for predictions. This clarity makes them particularly useful in fields like medicine, where transparent decision-making is crucial.

Decision trees aren't just standalone heroes, though. They gain significant power through ensemble techniques like bagging and boosting, which we'll explore in future posts. For now, dive into this introduction and take the first step toward mastering decision trees and understanding their pivotal role in machine learning.

Stay tuned for the next part of the "Climbing Trees" series, where we'll delve into implementing decision trees and how they evolve into forests, leading to cutting-edge algorithmic solutions!
