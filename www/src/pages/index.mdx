### PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08742) | 113 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37285396)

The paper titled "PMET: Precise Model Editing in a Transformer" by Xiaopeng Li and his co-authors proposes a new method for model editing in Large Language Models (LLMs). Model editing techniques modify a small portion of knowledge in LLMs at a low cost, and this paper aims to improve the precision of these edits.

Previous methods assumed that the hidden states of the Transformer Layer (TL) in LLMs are values of key-value memories of the Feed-Forward Network (FFN). These methods optimized the TL hidden states to remember target knowledge and used it to update the weights of the FFN. However, the TL hidden states contain information that is not specifically required for the FFN, and neglecting this fact reduces the performance of model editing.

To address this, the authors analyze the hidden states of the Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) and FFN, and discover that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns. This finding suggests that the MHSA weights do not need to be updated when new knowledge is introduced. Based on this insight, the authors introduce PMET, which optimizes the hidden states of the Transformer Component (TC, namely MHSA and FFN), while only using the optimized TC hidden states of FFN to precisely update FFN weights.

The experiments conducted demonstrate that PMET achieves state-of-the-art performance on both the COUNTERFACT and zsRE datasets. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of the enhancements introduced in PMET, emphasizing the finding that MHSA encodes certain general knowledge extraction patterns and stores a small amount of factual knowledge.

Overall, the proposed PMET algorithm improves the precision of model editing in LLMs, offering potential advancements in natural language processing and artificial intelligence.

### Interpretable graph neural networks for tabular data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models. Another user, "wstrnr," added that TabPFN (Transformers for Tabular Data) had similar performance to models like XGBoost, Catboost, LightGBM, KNN, SAINT, Reg Cocktail, Autogluon, and Auto-sklearn. They also noted the requirement of only 5 minutes to reach 20% ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) compared to TabPFN1.
