### Counterfactual Regret Minimisation or How I won any money in Poker?

#### [Submission URL](https://rnikhil.com/2023/12/31/ai-cfr-solver-poker.html) | 69 points | by [whoami_nr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=whoami_nr) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38823240)

Today's top story on Hacker News is about solvers in Poker and how they work. The author, who used to play Poker professionally, explains that solvers are tools used to analyze and optimize gameplay. Unlike games like Chess and Go, Poker involves imperfect information as players don't know their opponents' cards. Solving a Poker game means finding a Nash Equilibrium strategy, also known as a GTO (Game Theory Optimal) strategy, where neither player can improve their outcome by changing their strategy. However, while GTO ensures unexploitability, it may not maximize winnings. The best response strategy is one that maximally exploits an opponent's non-equilibrium play. Solvers determine the GTO play by using EV (Expected Value)-maximizing algorithms, where each agent represents a player and the goal is to maximize earnings. By iteratively playing against each other's strategies, the agents find the Nash equilibrium point. Regret is a measure of how well one could have done with an alternative action compared to their overall strategy. Minimizing regret is central to all GTO algorithms, with the most well-known being CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization). The author compares studying Poker to CFR, as they would play hands, review them with a coach, and aim to play more optimally in the future to reduce regret. The author also mentions the multi-armed bandit problem, which is a classic reinforcement learning problem and relates to Poker played in the partial information setting. The article concludes by discussing exploration vs. exploitation in decision making, using the example of picking travel destinations or restaurants.

The discussion on the submission includes various points and perspectives:

- One user mentions that CFR (Counterfactual Regret Minimization) solvers are slow and require a lot of RAM, but there is a smaller and abstract version of the game called Setback that doesn't need a perfect Nash equilibrium solution.
- Another user adds that commercially available solvers like CFR are not very strong and mentions Pluribus as an example of a precomputed solver that reduced state space and mapped hand combinations.
- A user shares their experience with using solvers like Monker Solver for multiple sports and states that they are fairly fast.
- The original poster mentions CFR in the context of transportation and logistics problems and gives other examples as well.
- A user comments that making money playing online poker by following computer-optimized strategies can be risky, but insights from optimized play are appreciated.
