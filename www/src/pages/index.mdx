### Wrongly Arrested Black Men Say CA Bill Would Let Police Misuse Face Recognition

#### [Submission URL](https://themarkup.org/2024/06/12/these-wrongly-arrested-black-men-say-a-california-bill-would-let-police-misuse-face-recognition) | 10 points | by [cdme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cdme) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40662980)

The article discusses the concerns of three Black men who were wrongly arrested due to police misuse of face recognition technology. These cases highlight the potential for civil rights violations and unjust consequences for individuals and their families. The men are now speaking out against a California bill that would restrict police from using face recognition as the sole basis for search or arrest, calling for more corroborating evidence.

Despite the bill's passage in the Senate Public Safety Committee, critics argue that a face recognition "match" is not conclusive evidence and can lead to wrongful arrests. The bill's author, Democratic Assemblymember Phil Ting, defends the legislation as a necessary step to prevent such injustices and improve civil rights protections in California.

The use of face recognition technology by law enforcement has raised concerns about accuracy and bias, especially in identifying individuals with dark skin or other underrepresented groups. The reliance on eyewitness testimony, coupled with face recognition results, can further complicate criminal investigations and contribute to wrongful convictions.

The experiences of these men underscore the importance of addressing the pitfalls of face recognition technology and ensuring that individuals are not unjustly targeted or arrested based on flawed or biased algorithms.

The discussion revolves around the argument that human judgment is critical in policing to ensure accuracy and benefit society by addressing errors and maintaining accountability. There is a comparison between human error in decision-making and the flaws of face recognition technology, highlighting the potential consequences of blindly trusting computer algorithms. 

The conversation delves into the issue of automation bias, where individuals have a tendency to rely on automated systems even when they present errors or questionable outcomes. An example from the 80s involving a Navy ship mistaking a commercial CD player for missile signals is used to illustrate the limitations of solely trusting computer systems.

There is a debate about the importance of human judgment versus computer analysis, with one side emphasizing the necessity of human questioning and accountability in decision-making, while the other side acknowledges the benefits of computer technology in certain fields like aviation. Additionally, the discussion touches on the challenges faced by law enforcement in utilizing face recognition technology and the need for a balanced approach that considers both human expertise and technological tools.

### The Geometry of Categorical and Hierarchical Concepts in Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01506) | 93 points | by [Anon84](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Anon84) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40640424)

The paper titled "The Geometry of Categorical and Hierarchical Concepts in Large Language Models" delves into how semantic meaning is encoded in representation spaces of large language models. The authors investigate how categorical concepts are represented, such as {'mammal', 'bird', 'reptile', 'fish'}, and how hierarchical relations between concepts are encoded. They extend the linear representation hypothesis to reveal a simple structure: categorical concepts are represented as simplices, hierarchically related concepts are orthogonal, and complex concepts are represented as polytopes constructed from direct sums of simplices. The study validates these results on the Gemma large language model, estimating representations for 957 hierarchically related concepts using data from WordNet. The paper provides insights into interpretability of language models and offers a novel perspective on how concepts are represented within them.

### Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03003) | 10 points | by [prince617](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=prince617) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40634775)

Today on Hacker News, a fascinating paper titled "Verified Code Transpilation with LLMs" was shared. The paper, authored by Sahil Bhatia and four others, explores the use of large language models (LLMs) to automatically transpile code while ensuring functional correctness guarantees. The proposal, called LLMLift, leverages LLMs to reason about programs and generate proofs for functional equivalence during code translation, ultimately outperforming previous tools in both benchmarks transpiled and transpilation time. This innovative approach not only streamlines the transpilation process but also reduces the expertise required to build such tools. For those interested in the intersection of programming languages and LLMs, this paper offers valuable insights and advancements in the field.

The discussion on the submission is centered around skepticism regarding the use of large language models (LLMs) in generating valid proofs for code transpilation. One user, "brfbggns," expresses doubt about the ability of LLMs to attach a proof engine and generate valid proofs, which seems to challenge the authority of Yann LeCunn, a prominent figure in the field. Another user, "prince617," responds by stating that LLM answers do not contain hallucinations or possess proof engines. "brfbggns" elaborates, mentioning that while they have engaged with LLM proof engines in a strictly defined formal context, they find them to be challenging as they seem to fall short on providing correct proofs. The conversation delves into the intricacies of LLMs in generating proofs and the potential limitations they might face in truly representing truth. The discussion highlights a critical examination of the effectiveness of LLMs in this context, despite the motivations behind their creation and utilization in code transpilation processes.
