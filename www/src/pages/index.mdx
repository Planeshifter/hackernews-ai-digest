#### [Submission URL](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/learningsystem) | 27 points | by [Curiositry](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Curiositry) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40841701)

In a thought-provoking piece titled "Escaping Flatland" on the Learning System, Henrik Karlsson explores the idea of decentralized knowledge and its role in education. He suggests that our world thrives on a vast, unseen reservoir of knowledge accumulated through informal processes, contrasting it with the formal education system. Karlsson argues that while schools and universities are vital, true learning occurs informally through on-the-job training, social interactions, and self-directed exploration.

He delves into the concept of the "learning system," which encompasses the organic spread of knowledge outside traditional educational institutions. Karlsson emphasizes the effectiveness of self-directed learning, citing examples of individuals gaining expertise in fields like blockchain technology through informal channels like online resources and mentorship. However, he acknowledges the potential pitfalls of decentralized knowledge transfer, such as the loss of critical skills or the perpetuation of harmful practices.

By examining the distinctions between the formal education system and the learning system, Karlsson prompts readers to consider how we can leverage decentralized knowledge reproduction to enhance the dissemination of valuable information. He challenges the conventional view of education by advocating for a more convivial, self-directed approach to learning that complements institutionalized education. Ultimately, his essay encourages a reevaluation of how we perceive and engage with knowledge in a rapidly evolving world.

The discussion on the submission "Escaping Flatland" revolves around contrasting intrinsic incentives and extrinsic incentives in education. One user, prst, emphasizes the importance of intrinsic incentives (like the internal motivation to learn) over extrinsic incentives (such as rewards and punishments) in promoting learning. They argue that the lack of intrinsic motivation in current educational systems is a significant drawback. Another user, shortrounddev2, points out the difference between intrinsic and extrinsic incentives, noting that intrinsic incentives are crucial for self-directed learning and can surpass the performance of students who rely on external motivators like rewards or punishments.

Additionally, a user named drkps shares insights on the state of public schooling, drawing on Henrik Karlsson's thoughts in the original submission. They raise questions about the effectiveness of public schools in preparing children for real-life situations, especially those coming from dysfunctional homes. By questioning the focus on learning practical life skills versus academic subjects, drkps highlights the potential disconnect between traditional education systems and the actual needs of students.

1. **srprstlk** announced the recent email notification detailing the AI features in Figma Design and its machine learning approach. They highlighted the start of training AI models to enhance features, understanding design concepts, patterns, and more.
   
2. **b3ing** expressed curiosity about starting file training and noted the upcoming change on August 15th, 2024, for content training settings. They brought up concerns about potential data privacy issues and the need for clarity on user rights related to content not provided to Figma AI.

3. **dpkrchnr** raised a point about ensuring clear rights for content not provided to Figma and the generated AI results. This could help identify customers who may claim ownership of extracted content results generated by limited AI requests.

4. **ko_pivot** discussed the use of binary file formats as a great test case for Figma's current AI limitations. They mentioned the potential for advanced approaches with Language Model Models (LLMs) and emphasized the significant work involved in such development.

5. **az226** and **ko_pivot** engaged in a discussion about different models, with **ko_pivot** pointing out the challenge of diffusing models into various applications like Figma while addressing the importance of language definitions and customer data privacy policies.

6. **jgalt212** shared a link to a blog post about simple ways to find exposed sensitive information in Language Model Models (LLMs), indicating a forward-looking perspective on the potential vulnerabilities and challenges associated with this technology.

### The Smart Principles: Designing Interfaces That LLMs Understand

#### [Submission URL](https://medium.com/@zhihao.zhou.bupt/the-smart-principles-designing-interfaces-that-llms-understand-aca00630c8c9) | 21 points | by [howard_zhou](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=howard_zhou) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40831200)

The article discusses the importance of designing interfaces that Large Language Models (LLMs) can easily understand to ensure the success and usability of products. It introduces the SMART principles for developing actions or plugins for platforms like GPTs, focusing on clear and effective interface design. The principles include keeping input parameters simple, using meaningful strings instead of numeric enums, and avoiding headers except for Authorization when designing interfaces for LLMs on platforms like GPTs. Simplifying inputs, using meaningful strings, and correct handling of Authorization parameters are key strategies to enhance the clarity and interpretability of data for LLMs, leading to more reliable interactions and a better user experience.

The discussion revolves around the importance of designing websites and interfaces that cater to Large Language Models (LLMs) to ensure better understanding and usability. 

- **ntrntgy** mentioned the challenge of designing websites specifically to cater to LLMs, making them understandable for humans as the models can sometimes find human interactions confusing.
- **mrbng** commented on the complexity of redesigning websites to make them accessible, mentioning screen readers and other considerations. They point out that the focus should not be solely on redesigning for specific use cases like stochastic processes.
- **az09mugen** highlighted the distinction between websites designed for humans versus LLMs, noting the increasing difficulty of web scraping due to protections like copyright laws affecting data availability.

- **skywhppr** suggested starting to design things with LLMs in mind, emphasizing the need to make logical and sensible structures that work well in the context of these models. They critiqued the current practice of bending software backwards to fit LLMs without making a genuine effort to create good software for humans first.
