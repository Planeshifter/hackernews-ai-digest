### Training is not the same as chatting: LLMs don’t remember everything you say

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2024/May/29/training-not-chatting/) | 196 points | by [simonw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=simonw) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40510668)

Simon Willison’s latest blog post dives into the misconception surrounding Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT regarding how "training" works. One common concern is users hesitating to interact with these tools out of fear of contributing to their training data. However, it's important to understand that LLMs, including ChatGPT, do not directly learn and memorize everything you say to them. They operate as stateless functions, treating each conversation as a separate entity without carrying forward memories from previous interactions.

Willison explains that starting a new chat conversation is akin to wiping the model's short-term memory clean, ensuring that each chat session is independent. Therefore, efforts to "train" the model by providing additional information during interactions are futile as the model resets with each new conversation. The concept of "context length" becomes crucial, dictating how much of the conversation the model can consider at a given time.

The idea of "training" in the realm of LLMs refers to the initial process of building these models through massive datasets, including vast amounts of text from various sources like Wikipedia, web scrapping, books, and more. It involves exhaustive pre-training to identify patterns in language and subsequent phases to refine the model's conversational abilities. Once trained, the model remains static, only occasionally undergoing updates that are distributed uniformly across servers.

Despite assurances that LLMs like ChatGPT do not directly train on user input, concerns about data usage persist due to vague terms and conditions allowing model improvements based on user interactions. The complexity lies in deciphering how providers utilize user data for enhancing their models, raising questions about data privacy and security.

Willison's insightful analysis sheds light on the nuances of LLMs' functioning, emphasizing the need for a clear understanding of how these models operate and how training processes shape their conversational capabilities.

The discussion on Hacker News around Simon Willison's blog post about Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT involved various viewpoints and clarifications. Some users emphasized that these models do not instantly remember all interactions, as each chat session operates independently without carrying memories from previous conversations. Others mentioned the technical aspects of training support points and the misconception of users believing the models instantly retain all information provided to them.

Additionally, there were discussions about potential misconceptions regarding human-like interactions with AI models and the expectations of memory retention. Some users highlighted the distinctions between different types of models, such as ChatGPT-the-model and ChatGPT-the-service, and the importance of correctly understanding and utilizing LLMs in product testing and development.

Furthermore, there were insights shared about the complexity and risks associated with the continuous improvement of AI models through training with external data sources. Some users raised concerns about potential risks of model crashes and the ongoing need for human oversight and intervention in the incremental training process of these models.

A team of researchers led by Sean McLeish has made a breakthrough in enhancing transformers' ability to perform arithmetic tasks. By introducing embeddings that encode the position of each digit relative to the number's start, the researchers were able to significantly improve the model's performance. This innovation not only boosted accuracy in arithmetic but also extended the transformer's capabilities to excel in tasks like sorting and multiplication. The study demonstrates that with the right enhancements, transformers can tackle complex arithmetic problems with up to 99% accuracy on 100-digit addition challenges. The findings open up possibilities for further exploration into the logical extrapolation abilities of transformers, paving the way for advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence research.

The discussion on the submission "Transformers Can Do Arithmetic with the Right Embeddings" explored various aspects of the research.

### Doing is normally distributed, learning is log-normal

#### [Submission URL](https://hiandrewquinn.github.io/til-site/posts/doing-is-normally-distributed-learning-is-log-normal/) | 240 points | by [hiAndrewQuinn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hiAndrewQuinn) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40497623)

The latest essay on gwern.net delves into the topic of "leaky pipelines" and log-normal distributions, shedding light on the challenges of software estimation and project management. The concept explores the idea that not all steps in a process follow a normal distribution, making it tricky to predict outcomes accurately.

In the realm of software development, the essay highlights the importance of just-in-time learning and the unpredictability of technical hurdles. It argues that the emphasis on relevant experience and specific tooling in job applications is justified, as the process of transitioning to new technologies often involves a significant learning curve.

Furthermore, the theory suggests that processes dominated by learning phases are more common than those that follow a normally distributed pattern. Mastering a new skill involves navigating through the leaky pipeline of uncertainty until it becomes routine and predictable.

The essay proposes that academic learning, with its structured curriculum and clear learning objectives, may offer a more controlled environment compared to the unpredictable nature of real-world projects. However, unexpected variations in learning times can still occur, highlighting the dynamic and non-linear nature of acquiring new skills.

Overall, the essay presents a thought-provoking perspective on the challenges of estimating project timelines in software development and the inherent uncertainties of the learning process in different domains.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various interesting points:

1. **Mathematical Analysis**: Users engaged in a mathematical analysis of the probabilities mentioned in the essay, highlighting potential errors in calculations and the importance of accurate mathematical reasoning in software estimation.

2. **Software Development Practices**: The conversation shifted towards discussing software estimation methodologies, contrasting traditional project management approaches like Waterfall and Gantt charts with the concept of just-in-time learning and non-normally distributed processes in software projects. The debate included perspectives on the challenges of estimating project timelines accurately in the dynamic environment of software development.

3. **Project Types Comparison**: Users compared construction projects to software development projects, emphasizing the differences in predictability, constraints, and solutions between the two domains. The discussion touched upon the complexities of managing uncertainty and adapting to changing requirements in software projects.

4. **Critique of Waterfall Approach**: A critical view of the Waterfall approach in project management was presented, noting its limitations in handling uncertainties and evolving project requirements effectively. The conversation highlighted the importance of flexible methodologies in software development to address changing needs and technical challenges.

5. **Industrial Engineering Perspective**: A user with an Industrial Engineering background shared insights on variance analysis and process design, drawing parallels between software estimation challenges and the fundamentals of engineering processes.
