### Beyond self-attention: How a small language model predicts the next token

#### [Submission URL](https://shyam.blog/posts/beyond-self-attention/) | 411 points | by [tplrbv](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tplrbv) | [72 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39251909)

In a recent blog post, the author shares their findings after diving deep into understanding how a small language model predicts the next token. They trained a small transformer model and wanted to explore what was happening internally to produce the model's results. The author discovered that each transformer block learns weights that associate a given prompt with a class of strings found in the training corpus. The distribution of tokens that follow those strings in the training corpus is what the block outputs as its predictions for the next token. Each block may associate the same prompt with a different class of training corpus strings, resulting in different predictions. The final transformer output is a combination of each block's predictions. The author implemented code that replicates this process and found that it produces outputs similar to the transformer model. The blog post provides a detailed walkthrough of the code implementation and presents supporting evidence for the proposed explanation. Overall, this research provides insights into how transformers make predictions and offers a unique perspective on the inner workings of language models.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to the article's content. Here are some key points mentioned:

- Some commenters discuss the implications of the research and the relevance of neural networks in understanding the phenomenon.
- The conversation touches on the use of language models in compression, copyright issues, and the challenges of training models with scrap internet content.
- There are also discussions about the limitations and possibilities of using discrete algorithms in optimizing models.
- The question of whether AI should be developed with energy-efficient gradient descent or specialized coprocessors is raised.
- Some commenters express confusion or lack of understanding about Shannon's treatment of systems and the relevance of mathematics in explaining neural networks.
- The topic of scraping web content for training data and the ethical implications of such actions is also explored.
- The discussion briefly delves into copyright laws and the concept of fair use in the context of AI training.
- Other comments touch on the technical aspects of implementing language models and the differences between GPT and transformers.

Overall, the discussion provides a mix of insights, questions, and debates around the research and its implications in areas such as AI development, copyright, and machine learning techniques.

### The FCC wants to criminalize AI robocall spam

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2024/02/02/fcc_ai_robocall/) | 222 points | by [mikece](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mikece) | [129 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39224249)

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the US is pushing for the criminalization of AI-powered robocall spam. The FCC has warned about the rising wave of scams enabled by voice-cloning technology, where machine-learning software can trick people into donating money to fraudulent causes. The agency believes that using AI voice cloning technology in robocalls should be deemed illegal under the 1991 Telephone Consumer Protection Act. The FCC's stance has received support from government officials across the US, and lawmakers are also working on legislation to address the issue. The goal is to protect consumers from being swindled by convincing robo-calls impersonating celebrities, politicians, and even loved ones.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to robocalls and spam.
- Several comments discuss the issue of fraudulent calls that claim to be refunding money. One user suggests that it could potentially be a problem if scammers exploit this scheme to trick people into providing sensitive information. Others suggest that it is important for customers to verify the legitimacy of such calls and be cautious about sharing personal information.
- There is a discussion about the inconvenience of receiving spam calls and texts. Some users express their dislike for unsolicited phone calls and texts, while others suggest that blocking numbers or implementing whitelists could help address the issue.
- The topic of international calls and how to handle spam from other countries is also brought up. Suggestions include blocking international calls unless they are from trusted contacts or implementing stricter terms for international carriers.
- The discussion shifts to the issue of spam SMS messages, particularly in the context of political campaigns. Some users raise concerns about the exemption of politicians from spam and junk mail laws, while others mention the importance of freedom of speech in political activities. The question of how to regulate political messages without infringing on free speech is also raised.
- There are comments about the benefit of existing laws for politicians and the potential abuse of automated calls in political campaigns. Some users express frustration with political spam and argue that it does not inform people or contribute to meaningful debates.
- The conversation concludes with a mention of a growing group of people in the UK who voted for Brexit, claiming that they were not properly informed about the consequences. This comment is in reference to the wider issue of misinformation and its impact on important decisions.

Overall, the discussion highlights various perspectives and concerns related to robocalls, spam, and the need for effective regulation in order to protect consumers and maintain the integrity of communication channels.
