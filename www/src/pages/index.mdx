### HyAB k-means for color quantization

#### [Submission URL](https://30fps.net/pages/hyab-kmeans/) | 41 points | by [ibobev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ibobev) | [16 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44514946)

Pekka Väänänen of 30fps.net dives into a fascinating exploration of color quantization using an intriguing twist on the traditional algorithm: the HyAB distance formula in CIELAB color space. At the heart of this exploration is the quest for enhanced image quality by converting the RGB values of an image into CIELAB space, where color differences can be calculated more in line with human perception. 

Väänänen is inspired by the FLIP error metric and a 2019 paper that introduces an alternative method for large color differences—HyAB, a hybrid distance formula combining "city block" and Euclidean distances. This method aims to improve perceptual accuracy by treating lightness and chroma as separate when calculating color differences. 

The real clincher in Väänänen’s research is applying the HyAB-inspired technique to k-means clustering, a statistical method popular for its applicability in color quantization. The idea is to select a suitable palette of colors from a high-color image by clustering similar colors together. By using the HyAB formula in place of the standard Euclidean distance within CIELAB space, the color quantization is allegedly more representative of actual visual differences.

The results of implementing this method show promise: images processed with the HyAB-adjusted k-means retain hues more accurately than those quantized with traditional methods, like sRGB or pure CIELAB with Euclidean distance. This method particularly shines in maintaining distinct hues in challenging colors like magenta and green, though with some caveats, such as a halo effect around red hues.

Väänänen explores further refinements, such as weighting the luminance differently in the HyAB formula, which offers more control over the final appearance without distorting hues, a common issue when other weights are adjusted in sRGB or CIELAB spaces. This weighting flexibility adds a layer of customization to how images can be processed under specific aesthetic goals or constraints.

While there's still ongoing debate about whether this method surpasses all traditional techniques, Väänänen’s experiment stands out by making the k-means clustering more adaptable through HyAB. It highlights how understanding and manipulating the theory behind color perception can translate into practical improvements in digital image processing, a critical concern in many fields including graphic design, printing, and digital media.

In summary, Väänänen's work is a testament to the power of rethinking established formulas with a perception-centric approach. It's an encouraging invitation for other developers and researchers to further explore color quantization's possibilities for more visually authentic and nuanced digital images.

The Hacker News discussion explores the trade-offs between color spaces like **OKLab**, **CIELAB**, **CAM16-UCS**, and **HyAB** for tasks like color quantization, gradient rendering, and dynamic design systems. Here's a distilled summary:

### Key Points of Debate:
1. **OKLab vs. CAM16-UCS**:
   - **OKLab** is praised for its simplicity, speed, and smoother gradients (e.g., in CSS), avoiding grays in blue-yellow transitions. Critics argue it’s a simplified, "good enough" model but lacks the perceptual rigor of **CAM16-UCS**, which is derived from complex color appearance models.
   - **CAM16-UCS** is considered more accurate but computationally intensive (e.g., converting 16M RGB colors to CAM16 takes ~6 seconds in Dart/JS), making it impractical for real-time applications.

2. **Performance vs. Accuracy**:
   - For web and design tools (e.g., CSS gradients), OKLab’s speed and deterministic results are prioritized. Real-time systems need conversions in **milliseconds**, not seconds.
   - Material 3’s dynamic color system uses clustering (Celebi’s K-Means) for accessibility and contrast, emphasizing deterministic outcomes over perfect perceptual accuracy.

3. **Perceptual Uniformity**:
   - OKLab claims perceptual uniformity but faces skepticism. Critics highlight edge cases (e.g., blue-yellow gradients) where CAM16-UCS might better model human vision. Proponents argue OKLab’s simplicity and smoother gradients suffice for most design needs.

4. **Gamut Mapping**:
   - OKLab’s approach (e.g., Oklch in CSS) is noted for smoother gamut mapping compared to CIE Lch, though some confusion arises about whether this is due to the color space or the mapping algorithm itself.

5. **Industry Use**:
   - Tools like Google’s Material Design balance theory with practicality. While CAM16 is scientifically robust, OKLab’s ease of implementation makes it a pragmatic choice for workflows requiring speed and simplicity.

### Conclusion:
The thread underscores the tension between **scientific rigor** (CAM16-UCS) and **practical application** (OKLab). Design systems prioritize speed and deterministic results, while academic contexts favor accuracy. OKLab’s adoption in CSS and tools highlights its niche as a "good enough" solution, even as debates about its perceptual fidelity persist.

### Is the doc bot docs, or not?

#### [Submission URL](https://www.robinsloan.com/lab/what-are-we-even-doing-here/) | 188 points | by [tobr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tobr) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44507244)

In a candid exploration of the challenges faced while modernizing Shopify email notification templates, Robin Sloan highlights a curious encounter with Shopify's LLM-powered developer documentation bot. The issue centers on figuring out how to detect if an order includes items fulfilled through Shopify Collective, a task that led Sloan to seek advice from the doc bot after traditional search methods fell short.

The bot's initial suggestion seemed plausible, proposing a Liquid syntax solution that should have worked. However, real-world testing (which involved repeated order placements and refunds) revealed that the requisite "Shopify Collective" tag wasn't attached to the order until after the confirmation email was sent. This delay in tagging, a nuance not documented, rendered the bot's advice ineffective.

Sloan questions the reliability of AI-powered documentation that may resort to educated guesses rather than providing infallible insights, especially when official documentation stakes are high. Despite some past successes in quick queries, this incident underscores the critical need for precise and dependable guidance in tech environments.

Ultimately, Sloan found a workaround by adapting existing code, checking product-level tags available at the email's generation time, successfully identifying Shopify Collective orders. This tale not only warns of the pitfalls of over-relying on AI but also celebrates the ingenuity required to navigate around them when they fall short.

The discussion revolves around the challenges and limitations of using AI, particularly Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, for technical documentation like Shopify's LLM-powered bot. Key points include:  
1. **AI vs. Human Judgment**: While AI can quickly generate plausible answers, it often struggles with **nuance** and **accuracy** in complex technical contexts. Users note that AI may confidently provide incorrect or incomplete solutions (e.g., missing real-world timing issues like delayed order tagging), highlighting the need for human oversight.  
2. **RAG System Limitations**: Technical hurdles with RAG—such as **context window constraints**, degradation in accuracy with larger documents, and inefficiency in filtering relevant information—make it unreliable for intricate queries.  
3. **Cost and Scalability**: Some argue AI documentation tools are cost-effective and faster than human efforts, but skeptics warn hidden costs (e.g., error correction) and context-handling flaws undermine scalability.  
4. **Human-Curated Documentation**: Participants stress that structured, **human-written documentation** remains critical, as AI cannot yet match the reliability, contextual awareness, and adaptability of expert-driven content.  
5. **Workarounds and Adaptability**: The incident underscores the necessity of developer ingenuity (e.g., using product tags) to bypass AI shortcomings when official documentation fails.  

Overall, the consensus leans toward **cautious integration of AI**—valuing its speed but recognizing its fallibility—while advocating for hybrid approaches that prioritize human expertise in critical technical domains.

In an unexpected twist fit for a sci-fi drama, one of the latest machine learning resources might be taking some creative liberties with the truth—when it comes to citations, at least. The book "Mastering Machine Learning: From Basics to Advanced" by Govindakumar Madhavan is raising eyebrows—and not just for its $169 price tag. Published by Springer Nature, it turns out that many of the book's citations might be more fiction than fact.

Retraction Watch, tipped off by a concerned reader, dug into this mystery and discovered a murky world of missing or incorrect citations. An analysis of 18 out of 46 references revealed that an astonishing two-thirds weren't quite what they seemed. Some researchers even found themselves surprisingly cited for works they never wrote, with one paper cited being no more than an unpublished arXiv preprint inaccurately referred to as an IEEE publication.

This citation conundrum hints at the possible use of AI-style generation methods, reminiscent of those employed by large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models, while proficient in creating human-like text, can sometimes fall prey to fabricating references, creating fictitious citations that look realistic but don't hold up under scrutiny.

Madhavan hasn't fully offered clarification on whether AI played a role in crafting his book, but he acknowledged the growing difficulty in distinguishing between AI- and human-generated content. As the debate over the use of AI in academia continues, this case underscores the importance of rigorous verification, lest we end up with scholarly versions of "alternative facts." The mystery deepens, awaiting further comment from the author, who is no stranger to the tech world, leading SeaportAi and creating an array of educational resources. Stay tuned as this tale of academic intrigue unfolds!

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the implications of AI-generated content in academia, sparked by a book published by Springer Nature containing fabricated citations. Key points include:

1. **AI’s Role in Content Creation**:  
   Users debate the difficulty of distinguishing AI-generated text from human writing, especially as LLMs advance. Some suspect the book’s citations were AI-generated, highlighting issues like "confabulation" (mixing real and invented references) and overconfident but inaccurate outputs.

2. **Publisher Accountability**:  
   Springer is criticized for damaging its reputation by failing to verify content. Commenters note a trend of declining textbook quality, with publishers prioritizing profit (e.g., high prices for poorly reviewed books) over rigorous peer review. References to past publishing errors (e.g., typos, incorrect images) suggest systemic issues.

3. **Verification Challenges**:  
   - Existing tools like DOI links and AI detectors are deemed insufficient, as they can’t always validate context or prevent circular dependencies (e.g., GPT-4 generating valid-looking but fake citations).  
   - Suggestions include manual checks, cross-referencing summaries with source material, and better institutional incentives for thorough peer review.

4. **Broader Academic Concerns**:  
   - Fear that AI could exacerbate problems like paper mills, fraudulent research, and "citation stuffing" to game academic metrics.  
   - Jokes about a future where AI reviews AI-written content, creating a self-referential loop of unverified information.  
   - Nostalgia for traditional, human-curated resources and lament over the erosion of trust in educational materials.

5. **Cultural Shifts**:  
   Mention of "Sturgeon's Law" (90% of content is "crap") underscores worries that AI might flood academia with low-quality work. Commenters stress the need for vigilance, better tools, and a return to quality-focused publishing practices to preserve scholarly integrity.  

In summary, the discussion reflects skepticism about AI's unchecked use in academia, frustration with profit-driven publishing, and calls for more robust validation mechanisms to combat misinformation.

### The Tradeoffs of SSMs and Transformers

#### [Submission URL](https://goombalab.github.io/blog/2025/tradeoffs/) | 64 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44503056)

In the world of machine learning, a fascinating discussion is taking place between enthusiasts and experts alike about State Space Models (SSMs) and Transformers. A blog post has been adapted from a popular talk, aimed at making this complex subject accessible to everyone, from casual readers to dedicated researchers. The crux of the conversation lies in understanding how SSMs are evolving as a strong contender in sequence modeling, traditionally dominated by Transformers, particularly in language processing.

State Space Models have come a long way, derived from a lineage of work that culminated in the development of models like Mamba. At their core, SSMs can be conceptualized as modern successors to recurrent neural networks (RNNs), with distinct advantages that help them rival the performance of Transformers.

Three essential ingredients characterize the success of SSMs:

1. **State Size**: SSMs feature a hidden state with a larger size than the inputs and outputs, enabling the model to store more context-rich information—a crucial trait for handling complex modalities like language.

2. **State Expressivity**: The recursive update functions in SSMs are expressive enough to store and selectively access needed information, akin to the gating mechanisms in classic RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs. This flexibility allows the model to handle sequences with varying information rates, a key requirement for language modeling.

3. **Training Efficiency**: While having a larger recurrent state boosts performance, it also increases computational complexity. Innovations like parallel scan algorithms have been employed to enhance the feasibility of training SSMs on modern hardware, balancing memory usage and computational workload.

The blog highlights that these strategies, though not entirely new, when combined effectively, bring SSMs to the forefront, demonstrating near-equivalence to Transformers in language modeling tasks.

The landscape of modern machine learning is rapidly shifting as researchers continuously seek to improve recurrent models. SSMs and other models like RWKV and Griffin are explored further, depicting diverse approaches in state expressivity and parallel training efficiency. The post delves into the nuances of linearity, selectivity, and the theoretical underpinnings of these models, underscoring a vibrant research area ripe with potential.

In sum, while Transformers have been the rockstars of sequence modeling, the advancements in SSMs suggest that the spotlight may start to share its focus, prompting an exciting era of innovation and rediscovery in the field.

The discussion around State Space Models (SSMs) versus Transformers reflects a mix of skepticism, optimism, and technical debate:  

### Key Themes:
1. **Tokenization Debate**:  
   - Some users argue that replacing tokenization schemes like BPE with raw bytes could simplify representations and better align with linguistic fundamentals. For example, one user claims raw bytes (as in Chinese characters or English letters) might offer a more basic, language-agnostic alternative to BPE.  
   - Counterarguments suggest Transformers *require* preprocessing to compress dense information efficiently, particularly for video/audio tasks. Current architectures still depend heavily on tokenization despite its limitations.  

2. **SSMs vs. Transformers**:

At Soundslice, the company renowned for its sheet music scanner, something unexpected yet oddly intriguing occurred. Adrian Holovaty, the man behind the operation, noticed an unusual trend surfacing within the error logs. Instead of dealing exclusively with faulty images of sheet music, they were flooded with screenshots of ChatGPT sessions. These weren't traditional music notations but ASCII tablature—guitar music’s rather rudimentary notation style. Unlike other types of uploads, these images weren't supported by their system.

So, why were these ASCII tab screenshots gaining traction on their platform? The mystery unraveled when Holovaty delved into ChatGPT himself. The AI was erroneously advising users to visit Soundslice for audio playback of ASCII tabs, a feature that didn't actually exist. This miscommunication had inadvertently turned into a stream of users seeking a solution that the platform didn’t offer.

Faced with a unique challenge–a steady influx of users misled by AI—and an unconventional market demand, Soundslice had a choice. They could dismiss the misconceptions with disclaimers or innovate by meeting this unforeseen demand head-on. In a twist to the tale, they opted for the latter, developing an ASCII tab importer—a feature Holovaty humorously admitted was at the bottom of his 2025 expectation list.

This situation presents an intriguing conundrum for modern businesses: How should companies respond when misinformation about their product inadvertently creates customer demand? Should strategic decisions be influenced by incorrect external narratives? While Holovaty finds satisfaction in creating a tool beneficial to users, there’s a lingering ambivalence—was their hand forced into development by AI misinformation? A quandary that sparks broad reflection on the ethical interplay between AI, misinformation, and product development.

The discussion revolves around AI's impact on technology, society, and ethics, sparked by the Soundslice case where users followed ChatGPT’s misleading advice, leading the company to adapt by adding unsupported features. Key themes include:  
- **AI’s Role in Development**: Users noted GPT-4’s ability to guess API code, but emphasized that opaque APIs and AI’s unpredictability risk confusion.  
- **Content Quality Concerns**: Tools like Grammarly, while helpful, were criticized for stripping human nuance (e.g., passive voice fixes harming stylistic intent). AI-generated text’s reliability was debated—praised for SEO efficiency but derided for “hallucinations” and threats to authenticity.  
- **Job Displacement Fears**: Many worried AI could rapidly replace jobs, disproportionately affecting workers without political safeguards (e.g., universal basic income). Historical parallels to the Luddite movement and industrial revolution underscored resistance to disruptive tech.  
- **Corporate Responsibility**: Critics blamed “greedy business managers” for prioritizing short-term cost-cutting via AI over long-term societal health, risking job markets and quality outputs.  
- **Ethical Regulation**: Calls for frameworks to ensure AI benefits society, not just corporations. Some argued societal structures, not tech itself, are the root issue (e.g., unnecessary jobs vs. equitable redistribution).  
- **Irony and Paradox**: The Soundslice incident exemplified unintended demand creation via AI errors. Others humorously compared worshipping AI to deity-like reliance, highlighting unease with unchecked power.  

Overall, the comments reflect cautious pessimism about AI’s rapid integration without ethical guardrails, stressing the need for human oversight, adaptive policies, and proactive regulation to mitigate disruption.

### AI cameras change driver behavior at intersections

#### [Submission URL](https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-intersection-monitoring) | 51 points | by [sohkamyung](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sohkamyung) | [107 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44489552)

In an effort to make roads safer and reduce traffic fatalities, U.S. cities are adopting Vision Zero, a strategy originally from Sweden that aims to eliminate road deaths by employing AI-driven camera systems. These systems, powered by companies like Stop for Kids and Obvio.ai, are being deployed at intersections to catch drivers who ignore stop signs and engage in risky behavior. Intersections are a critical focus since they are the site of about half of all car accidents, often resulting in severe outcomes.

One poignant story fueling this technological push is that of Kamran Barelli, CEO of Stop for Kids. Barelli founded the company after his wife and young son were nearly killed by an inattentive driver. Dissatisfied with traditional speed signs and intermittent police presence, Barelli and his team designed a more sophisticated solution. Their AI cameras, capable of operating around the clock and in all lighting conditions, automatically issue citations for violations while respecting driver privacy by not recording faces.

The system has shown promising results in pilot programs, such as in Saddle Rock, N.Y., where compliance with stop signs soared from 3% to 84% following implementation. These AI cameras not only encourage safer driving but also offer incentives like potential reductions in insurance rates, making them both a carrot and a stick for promoting road safety. As these technologies gain traction, they offer a glimpse into a future where AI plays a crucial role in transforming driver behavior and contributing to public safety.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the efficacy of **stop signs vs. rolling stops**, enforcement challenges, and comparisons of traffic safety infrastructure across regions (e.g., U.S., EU). Key points include:

1. **Stop Sign Compliance vs. Rolling Stops**:  
   - Critics argue many drivers perform "rolling stops" (slowing but not stopping completely), risking pedestrian safety, especially at intersections with poor visibility.  
   - Some defend rolling stops in low-traffic scenarios (e.g., empty intersections), claiming full stops waste time and energy. Others counter that incremental injuries from non-compliance add up over time.  

2. **Technology & Enforcement**:  
   - AI-driven cameras and computer vision are supported for 24/7 enforcement, particularly near schools/residential areas. Critics caution against over-reliance on tech without addressing systemic issues like road design.  
   - Mixed opinions exist on automated citations: supporters emphasize fairness and deterrence, while skeptics highlight privacy concerns and potential misuse.  

3. **Infrastructure Comparisons**:  
   - European designs (e.g., roundabouts, priority rules in Netherlands/Germany) are praised for reducing conflicts, contrasting with U.S. reliance on 4-way stops.  
   - Debate on signage clarity: U.S. "yield" conventions differ from EU road markings, impacting driver predictability.  

4. **Pedestrian Safety**:  
   - Poorly marked crosswalks, driver distraction, and lax enforcement create risks. Suggestions include better lighting, redesigned intersections, and stricter penalties for ignoring stop signs.  

5. **Statistics & Cultural Factors**:  
   - Higher U.S. traffic fatalities (vs. EU) are linked to urban sprawl, longer driving distances, and car-dependent lifestyles. Calls for public transit investment and reduced sprawl to mitigate risks.  
   - Cultural attitudes (e.g., prioritizing convenience over pedestrian safety) are seen as barriers to Vision Zero goals.  

**Conclusion**: The thread highlights tensions between pragmatic driving habits and stringent enforcement, advocating for balanced solutions combining AI enforcement, infrastructure redesign, and systemic shifts toward pedestrian-centric planning.
