In a shocking turn of events, OpenAI, the artificial intelligence company that brought us ChatGPT, is now making headlines for all the wrong reasons. While touting the release of ChatGPT 4o with its human-like conversational abilities, the company is also facing a major internal crisis. The resignations of key figures like co-founder and chief scientist Ilya Sutskever, along with his team leader Jan Leike, have sparked intense speculation and controversy.

The departure of these high-profile employees from OpenAI's superalignment team has raised concerns about the company's direction and culture. The lack of transparency surrounding their resignations has only fueled rumors and theories about what might be happening behind closed doors at OpenAI. One particularly troubling detail that has emerged is the strict off-boarding agreement that former employees are required to sign, which includes nondisclosure and non-disparagement clauses. This agreement effectively silences departing employees, preventing them from speaking out against the company or even acknowledging the existence of the NDA. Failure to comply with these terms can result in the loss of millions of dollars in vested equity, a severe consequence that acts as a powerful deterrent against speaking out. As OpenAI struggles to address the fallout from the resignations and the backlash over its restrictive policies, questions continue to swirl about the company's commitment to transparency and accountability. The once-celebrated tech giant now finds itself embroiled in controversy, raising doubts about its true priorities and values.

### Bye Bye, AI: How to block Google's AI overviews and just get search results

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/software/google-chrome/bye-bye-ai-how-to-block-googles-annoying-ai-overviews-and-just-get-search-results) | 53 points | by [adamcarson](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=adamcarson) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40382687)

Google's "AI Overviews" feature, known as SGE (Search Generative Experience), has stirred up controversy for its unreliable and often misleading AI summaries that dominate search results. Users have reported instances where the AI's advice, such as suggesting urine consumption for kidney stones, has overshadowed credible sources. The absence of an option to disable this function in Google settings has left users frustrated. However, there are workarounds to bypass these AI-generated summaries and access the traditional list of web pages.

For Chrome users, a simple tweak allows all searches to be directed to Google's web search tab. By adding a custom search engine with the parameter ?udm=14, queries from the address bar will skip the AI-overview-laden results. Additionally, a Chrome extension aptly named Hide Google AI Overviews hides these summaries on the search results page.

On mobile devices like Android or iOS, where Chrome lacks the flexibility of desktop browsers, Firefox offers a solution. By setting up a custom search engine in Firefox with the same parameter, users can search directly from the web tab, avoiding the AI summaries altogether.

While Google's attempt to enhance search results with AI may have missed the mark, users can take steps to ensure they receive accurate and reliable information without the interference of AI-generated content.

The author discusses the limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in performing effective brainstorming tasks, highlighting that while they exhibit some creativity, they tend to converge on existing patterns in data rather than generating truly innovative ideas. The author suggests that for cutting-edge problems, LLMs may not offer substantial insights beyond clichÃ©s. Proposing solutions such as curating specialized training datasets and implementing methods to reward creativity in LLM responses, the author reflects on the challenges and potential enhancements needed in LLM training processes. Overall, the article questions the current efficacy of LLMs in advanced brainstorming scenarios and presents avenues for potential improvements in their capabilities.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission regarding limitations of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 in brainstorming tasks involved various viewpoints and insights. 

1. Users debated the creativity of LLMs in brainstorming, with one user highlighting that LLMs tend to follow existing patterns in the data rather than generating truly innovative ideas. Another user emphasized the importance of prompt engineering to enhance creativity in LLM responses.

2. There was discussion on the training patterns of LLMs, with a user suggesting that LLMs need to be trained to diverge from existing patterns and reward creativity. This led to conversations about the impact of increasing temperature settings on the model's performance.

3. Some users criticized the methodology of a reviewed article regarding the validation of LLMs' creative thinking capabilities, pointing out flaws in the sample size and training data used.

4. Users discussed the role of randomness in LLMs and AI research, with some advocating for the incorporation of randomness to improve creativity and problem-solving abilities in models.

5. The conversation also touched upon the misconception of the novelty of ideas generated by LLMs compared to human creativity and highlighted the challenges in fostering creativity through AI training processes.

Overall, the discussion highlighted the complexities and areas for improvement in leveraging LLMs for advanced brainstorming tasks.
