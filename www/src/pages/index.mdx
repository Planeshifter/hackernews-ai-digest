### I played 1k hands of online poker and built a web app with Cursor AI

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.rchase.com/i-played-1-000-hands-of-online-poker-and-built-a-web-app-with-cursor-ai/) | 103 points | by [reillychase](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=reillychase) | [151 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45520154)

A founder’s two-week dive into low-stakes poker turned into a surprising case study in AI-assisted development. After tooling around with Python scripts to export PokerStars hands, he asked Grok—and then Cursor—to help, and in 2–3 days shipped a full Laravel poker stats web app without “writing a single line” himself. The app includes a 700+ line hand-history parser, VPIP/PFR/3-bet stats, journaling and bankroll logs, multi-file uploads and paste-import, scheduled PokerStars exports every 15 minutes, Gmail IMAP ingestion for PINs/hand histories, daily balance checks, a hand viewer, and P/L charts. Built locally with Herd and deployed to DigitalOcean, it lives at poker.rchase.com (he even shares his last 1,000 hands). The post doubles as a poker-learning reflection—emotional control, risk management, process over outcomes—and as a marker of how far AI coding agents (Grok, Cursor, Claude) have come from “vibe coding” demos to shipping integrations and refactors. Expect discussion around reliability, security, maintainability, and what “not writing any code” really means in an AI-as-developer workflow.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around several key themes:

1. **Online Poker Integrity**:  
   - Many users argue that **collusion and bots** plague online poker, especially at lower stakes. Some claim regulated sites (like Michigan-based platforms) are better at verification, but skepticism remains about detecting sophisticated bots or coordinated cheating.  
   - Others counter that **most players simply play poorly**, likening their strategies to "blackjack" or "bingo," making bot dominance overstated.  

2. **Bot Realities**:  
   - Debates erupt over whether bots are a **widespread threat** or a niche issue. Some insist bots destroyed mid-stakes games years ago, while others (like self-described winning players) downplay their current impact, emphasizing that exploiting human errors remains more profitable.  

3. **Game Theory Optimal (GTO) Impact**:  
   - GTO solvers have **raised the skill ceiling**, making games tougher. Critics argue solvers lead to robotic play and over-reliance on preflop charts, while proponents highlight their utility for studying complex postflop scenarios and adjusting to opponents.  

4. **Live vs. Online Dynamics**:  
   - Live poker (e.g., Las Vegas cash games) is seen as softer but dominated by **regulars** who exploit recreational players. Online play is viewed as more technically demanding but rife with trust issues.  

5. **AI Development Claims**:  
   - The submission’s “no code” assertion is questioned. Users debate whether AI tools like Cursor/Grok **accelerate development** versus truly replacing coding, with concerns about maintainability and security in AI-generated code.  

6. **Regulation and Trust**:  
   - Skepticism persists about online platforms’ ability to prevent collusion or verify identities, despite claims of improved regulation. Some suggest **IP tracking** and behavioral analysis as countermeasures.  

**Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of poker-strategy pragmatism, skepticism toward online platforms, and cautious optimism about AI’s role in coding—while underscoring that poker’s human element (and its flaws) remains central.

### Show HN: FleetCode – Open-source UI for running multiple coding agents

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/built-by-as/FleetCode) | 90 points | by [asdev](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=asdev) | [49 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518861)

FleetCode: a lightweight desktop terminal that lets you run multiple CLI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex) side by side—each in its own isolated git worktree—so runs don’t step on each other and can be resumed later.

Highlights
- Parallel sessions: spin up multiple agent terminals at once, compare outputs, or split tasks across sessions.
- Git worktree isolation: every session gets its own worktree off a chosen parent branch; cleanup on close.
- Persistent state: sessions are saved and auto-resume (--resume <uuid>), with first-run support (--session-id <uuid>).
- Extensible via MCP: configure Model Context Protocol servers (stdio or SSE) to give agents extra tools/context.
- Terminal controls: preset themes (macOS Light/Dark, Solarized Dark, Dracula, One Dark, GitHub Dark), font/size, cursor blink; rename/close/delete sessions.
- Setup commands: run shell commands before the agent starts (env, sourcing files, etc.).

Getting started
- Prereqs: Node.js 16+, Git, and the agent CLI you’ll use (e.g., @anthropic-ai/claude-cli).
- Install: npm install
- Dev: npm run dev
- Build/Run: npm run build && npm start

Troubleshooting
- macOS “unidentified developer”: xattr -cr /path/to/FleetCode.app
- Claude Code reading the wrong directory: disable “Auto connect to IDE” (claude config → set autoConnectToIde to false).

Project notes
- TypeScript-heavy codebase; ISC license.
- Latest release: 1.0.1-beta.6 (Oct 8, 2025).
- Repo: built-by-as/FleetCode (≈207⭐, 8 forks).

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

**Key Themes**
1. **Comparisons & Alternatives**  
   - Users mention similar tools like GitButler, Crystal, DevSwarm, and Container (Dagger) for parallel coding workflows.  
   - Git worktree-based isolation is compared to container-based approaches, with debates about complexity vs. safety.  
   - Some prefer existing terminal multiplexers vs FleetCode's specialized UI.

2. **Workflow Concerns**  
   - Questions about dependency management (CLI agents modifying system environments).  
   - Interest in IDE/Jira integrations for task tracking.  
   - Praise for persistent sessions but concerns about UI complexity vs CLI purity.

3. **Technical Implementation**  
   - macOS theme support noted as a strength.  
   - MCP protocol extensibility sparks discussion about agent customization.  
   - Questions about FleetCode's differentiation from other Git worktree tools.

4. **Community Feedback**  
   - Multiple users reference DevSwarm as a comparable project focusing on "swarm" coding collaboration.  
   - Some confusion with JetBrains Fleet IDE due to naming similarity.  
   - Requests for demo videos/documentation to clarify workflow.

**Notable Points**
- Users highlight GitButler's branch management as a complementary/competing workflow tool.  
- Debate about whether containers add unnecessary overhead for local dev vs Git worktree isolation.  
- Several contributors share their own related projects (e.g., CueIt Kanban agents, prctlkm TUI implementation).  
- Mixed reactions to terminal UI vs pure CLI approaches for AI agent management.

### Now open for building: Introducing Gemini CLI extensions

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/developers/gemini-cli-extensions/) | 154 points | by [meetpateltech](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=meetpateltech) | [40 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45516426)

Google is opening an extensions ecosystem for Gemini CLI, its open-source, AI agent for the terminal. Extensions are installable integrations that connect Gemini to external tools and services, aiming to cut context-switching by letting the AI operate your stack from the command line.

Highlights
- What it is: A framework for “extensions” that add capabilities to Gemini CLI via pre-packaged playbooks, so the AI knows how to use new tools immediately.
- One-liner install: gemini extensions install <GitHub URL or local path>.
- Ecosystem: Launch partners include Dynatrace, Elastic, Figma, Harness, Postman, Shopify, Snyk and Stripe, alongside Google-built and community extensions. A new directory lists extensions and ranks them by GitHub stars.
- Under the hood: Extensions can bundle Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, context files (e.g., GEMINI.md), excluded/overridden tools, and custom slash commands. The AI consults the extension’s playbook and your local context (files, git status) to decide which tool to run.
- Google-made add-ons: Cloud Run (deploy from local to public URL), GKE management, gcloud integration, and Cloud Observability.
- Adoption stat: Google says over 1M developers have used Gemini CLI in its first three months.

Why it matters
- Brings “agentic” workflows to the terminal in an open, extensible way, letting developers wire AI into real tooling without bespoke setup.
- Moves beyond raw MCP hookups by packaging usage guidance and commands, which should reduce friction and produce useful results from the first run.

Getting started
- Install extensions directly from GitHub or a local path.
- Browse the new Extensions page to discover community, partner, and Google-built options.

Things to watch
- Security and trust: Review extension source, requested permissions, and what commands it can run, especially given access to local files and git state.
- Reliability: How well playbooks generalize across varied project setups will determine real-world utility.

The Hacker News discussion on Google's Gemini CLI extensions reveals a mix of cautious interest, technical critiques, and comparisons with competitors like Claude. Key points include:

1. **Technical Feedback & Comparisons**:
   - Users reported mixed experiences with Gemini CLI, with some finding it less reliable than Claude for complex tasks (e.g., code migration). Critics highlighted issues with context handling, error-prone outputs, and a lack of depth in documentation.
   - Claude was praised for better workflow support (e.g., subagents, nested planning) and handling of coding tasks, though Gemini was noted as cheaper and sufficient for simpler use cases.

2. **Security Concerns**:
   - Multiple comments stressed the importance of auditing extension code due to security risks, especially given CLI access to local files and systems. A community fork ([gemini-cl-security](https://github.com/QuanZhang-William/gemini-cl-security)) was mentioned as an effort to address these concerns.

3. **Integration Quirks**:
   - The Figma extension drew confusion, with users questioning how a CLI tool integrates with a design platform. Some speculated it might read design files to assist coding, but others found the implementation limited (e.g., read-only MCP, minimal utility).

4. **Usability Critiques**:
   - Critics called Gemini CLI’s interface overwhelming, citing fragmented design and poor integration with existing tools. Complaints included flashing screens, token limits, and a lack of IDE-like context awareness.

5. **Pricing & Value**:
   - Gemini’s cost-effectiveness (10x cheaper tokens) was contrasted with Claude’s higher price but superior functionality. Some users preferred Gemini for basic tasks but acknowledged Claude’s edge in complex scenarios.

6. **Skepticism About AI Agents**:
   - Doubts were raised about the practicality of AI in CLI workflows, with users noting limitations in handling nuanced tasks and reliance on rigid playbooks.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about Gemini CLI’s potential but underscores concerns around reliability, security, and integration depth compared to established alternatives.

### Legal Contracts Built for AI Agents

#### [Submission URL](https://paid.ai/blog/ai-agents/paid-gitlaw-introducing-legal-contracts-built-for-ai-agents) | 70 points | by [arnon](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=arnon) | [42 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45515640)

Paid has teamed up with GitLaw to release an open-source “Agentic MSA” — a Master Services Agreement tailored for AI agents rather than traditional SaaS. The pitch: most AI agent startups are still using SaaS contracts built for passive tools, which breaks down when agents act autonomously, continuously, and adapt over time.

What’s broken with SaaS contracts for agents
- Agents make decisions without human approval, run 24/7, and evolve — creating gaps in liability and expectations. Think the Ford dealership chatbot “free truck” fiasco.
- You can’t price outcomes or protect margins if your contract assumes predictable, seat-based software.

What the Agentic MSA covers
- Agent classification and responsibility: Clarifies the agent is a tool; customers set parameters and retain oversight. Section 1.2 limits vendor liability for autonomous decisions.
- Liability and risk: Disclaimers that outputs require human verification, plus damage caps (e.g., 12 months’ fees) and AI-specific accuracy language. Sections 7 and 4.1.
- Data and training: Customers own their data and outputs; optional, clearly-described use of de-identified, aggregated data for model improvement with opt-outs. Section 2.1 and cover-page variables.

Why it matters
- Aligns legal terms with how agents actually operate, enabling outcome-based pricing and clearer risk allocation. As Paid’s CEO puts it: you can’t bill for outcomes using seat-based SaaS terms.

How to use it
- It’s free and open source via the GitLaw Community, with an AI agent to generate customized versions. It builds on CommonPaper’s Software Licensing Agreement and AI Addendum. The teams stress it’s a starting point; work with counsel to tailor it as laws evolve.

The discussion revolves around the challenges of assigning liability and responsibility when AI agents operate under traditional SaaS contracts, highlighting key debates and considerations:

1. **Liability Allocation**:  
   - Participants argue that existing SaaS contracts fail to address autonomous AI behavior, where decisions aren't human-approved. Comparisons are made to industries like construction, where liability is clearly assigned (e.g., contractors vs. suppliers).  
   - **Examples**: If an AI deletes a production database, should the vendor (like OpenAI) or the end-user bear responsibility? Contrasts are drawn to traditional services (e.g., AWS deleting a database vs. a hosted AI agent doing so).  

2. **Contract Limitations**:  
   - Traditional contracts assume deterministic, static software, not adaptive AI. Some suggest explicit disclaimers (akin to MIT licenses) to limit liability, though others counter that vendors like OpenAI may still face accountability for harmful outputs.  

3. **Data and Model Evolution**:  
   - Concerns arise about AI models evolving post-deployment, altering behavior unpredictably. Contracts may need clauses addressing updates, frozen model versions, or user consent for changes.  

4. **Legal Frameworks**:  
   - References to the **Law of Agency** (for human agents) highlight the mismatch with AI autonomy. Participants debate whether AI agents should be treated as tools (user-liable) or independent actors (vendor-liable).  

5. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - Maintaining contracts as AI evolves is seen as impractical. Suggestions include outcome-based pricing, insurance models (like gambling/financial industries), or clear terms on component failures (e.g., faulty third-party APIs).  

6. **Industry Examples**:  
   - Incidents like Ford’s chatbot offering free trucks or Replit’s AI deleting databases illustrate real-world gaps. Participants stress the need for explicit language around human oversight and damage caps (e.g., 12 months’ fees).  

**Key Takeaway**: The Agentic MSA is a starting point, but legal frameworks must evolve to address AI’s unique risks—autonomy, adaptability, and indirect control—while balancing vendor protection and user responsibility. Collaboration between legal and technical teams is critical as laws and AI capabilities advance.

### OpenAI Apps SDK: The New Browser Moment

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nuefunnel.com/blog/openai-apps-sdk-the-new-browser-moment) | 17 points | by [sidhusmart](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sidhusmart) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45518778)

TL;DR
The Apps SDK frames ChatGPT as a universal action interface: instead of sending you to sites, it fulfills intents inside the chat by calling third‑party apps. That shifts the web from routing attention to executing tasks—and puts OpenAI in the platform seat.

Key ideas
- Assistant > browser: Queries like “find me a holiday apartment…” don’t return links; they trigger integrated apps (e.g., booking) to perform the task in-line. Search routes less; agents execute more.
- Not just automation: Unlike “computer use” approaches, Apps SDK is an official integration layer—closer to a platform than a macro runner.
- Siri, but unbounded: Apple’s App Intents hinted at this, but were siloed, brittle, and phrase-dependent. LLMs make intent parsing flexible, cross‑platform, and open to any developer—if OpenAI can solve app discovery and quality at scale.
- Who wins: Transactional apps (commerce, travel, productivity, payments) gain a new distribution channel with retained transactions. Who loses: Attention/ads businesses (news, social, portals) risk disintermediation as summaries and answers happen in‑chat.
- The execution economy: Value migrates from information to action. Knowledge becomes “free” (synthesized instantly), execution becomes premium (bookings, purchases), trust decides which app gets invoked.
- Platform gravity and risk: If ChatGPT becomes the default interface, OpenAI controls discovery, economics, and data access—echoing Google Search and the App Store. Expect innovation pull and regulatory push; developers will optimize for ChatGPT rankings.
- Competitive context: Similar ambitions from Perplexity’s Comet and The Browser Company’s Dia, but Apps SDK is a first‑party, “blessed” app layer rather than browser automation.

Why it matters
- For developers: New demand channel, but platform dependency and ranking dynamics loom. Build for intents, not pages.
- For publishers: Summaries siphon attention; without control of the surface, ad models weaken. Monetization may hinge on paid execution or partnerships.
- For users: Fewer tabs, more outcomes—“talk to do.” The assistant becomes the operating system for the web’s next layer.

Open questions
- Discovery and governance: How will ChatGPT rank apps, handle conflicts, and enforce quality/security?
- Economics: Beyond pure transactions, what rev‑share or payout models emerge for non‑transactional utilities?
- Interop and lock‑in: Will there be neutral standards for agent/app intents, or a new era of platform silos?

Takeaway
If the browser made the web clickable and the smartphone made it touchable, assistants are making it actionable. The Apps SDK is positioned as that step—shifting the web from reading to doing, and moving the center of gravity from attention to execution.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the potential significance of OpenAI's Apps SDK, drawing comparisons to historical tech milestones and expressing both optimism and skepticism:

1. **Historical Comparisons & Skepticism:**
   - A user compares OpenAI's current phase to pivotal moments like Steve Jobs' Apple, the App Store, and the browser revolution, suggesting the SDK could redefine app interaction. However, skepticism is raised about overhyping the technology, noting past innovations (e.g., "terminal moments" or early LLMs) that failed to meet transformative expectations.

2. **Analyst Frameworks vs. Hype:**
   - One commenter critiques the reliance on buzz, advocating instead for established analyst frameworks (Forrester, Gartner) to evaluate progress, implying that structured analysis trumps speculative hype in understanding OpenAI’s advancements.

3. **New Delivery Models & the "Super App" Angle:**
   - Another user likens the SDK’s potential to the World Wide Web (WWW), suggesting it could unlock novel service delivery principles. A cryptic reply hints at further exploration ("dd"). 
   - A separate comment speculates about OpenAI’s strategy to position ChatGPT as a U.S.-centric "super app" (à la WeChat), aiming to survive competitive markets by consolidating multiple services.

**Key Themes:**
- **Optimism:** The SDK is framed as a paradigm shift, enabling action-oriented interfaces and new distribution models.
- **Skepticism:** Past tech hypes (e.g., underdelivering LLMs) serve as cautionary tales.
- **Market Strategy:** OpenAI’s move could be part of a broader play to dominate via platform control or super-app status.

**Open Questions:**
- Will the SDK truly replicate the impact of the App Store or browsers?
- Can OpenAI avoid past pitfalls of overhyped tech while navigating platform governance and competition?

- Advanced no‑code debugging: Step‑by‑step workflow execution in a visual editor, ability to iterate on a specific step in a console panel, and real‑time errors pinned to the exact failing step.
- Performance boost: Faster project creation (previously could take ~5 seconds) and parallel runs so multi‑step workflows can execute simultaneously to cut wait times.

Why it matters
- Opal lets people build AI‑powered mini‑apps using natural language—no coding. Early users built more sophisticated tools than expected, so Google is shoring up reliability (debugging) and throughput (parallelism) to handle more complex, production‑like workflows.

Availability
- Access via opal.withgoogle.com; Google is also promoting a Discord builder community.

Bottom line: Google is turning a neat Labs experiment into a more serious no‑code platform by adding transparent debugging and concurrency, while expanding access to a wider creator base.

**Summary of Discussion on Google's Opal Expansion:**

1. **Product Skepticism and Quality Concerns:**  
   - Many users expressed doubts about Google’s track record of discontinuing products (*“shiny promotions…software retirement village”*).  
   - Criticisms of AI-generated content quality (*“garbage AI-generated blog posts”*) and skepticism about Opal’s reliability for complex workflows.  

2. **Comparisons to Competitors:**  
   - Microsoft’s past low-code tools (e.g., Power Apps) were cited as cautionary examples.  
   - Opal was unfavorably compared to existing platforms like **n8n**, **Node-RED**, **Zapier**, and visual tools like Unreal Engine’s Blueprints.  

3. **No-Code Debate:**  
   - Mixed opinions on no-code viability: Critics argued it struggles with complex logic (*“block-box work”*), while supporters noted success in niche domains (e.g., **Wix**, **Shopify**).  
   - Visual programming’s limitations were highlighted (*“hard to express state machines in code-like fashion”*).  

4. **Regulatory and Market Dynamics:**  
   - EU users lamented exclusion from Opal’s rollout, sparking debates on tech regulation. Some argued regulations stifle innovation, while others blamed market dynamics (e.g., dominance of firms like Google).  

5. **Meta Criticism:**  
   - A flagged comment chain questioned the discussion’s quality, pointing to **HN guidelines** on substantive discourse.  

**Key Takeaway:** The discussion reflects broader skepticism about Google’s product longevity and AI’s role in no-code tools, alongside debates on no-code’s limitations versus its niche successes. Concerns about regulatory fragmentation (e.g., EU vs. global markets) also surfaced.

### AI gets more 'meh' as you get to know it better

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/08/more_researchers_use_ai_few_confident/) | 77 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45519161)

AI’s honeymoon with researchers may be over, says Wiley’s new “ExplanAItions 2025” survey preview

- Adoption up, confidence down: 84% of 2,430 researchers now use AI (was 57% in 2024), but those who think AI already outperforms humans in tested tasks fell from 53% to under a third. Early adopters remain rosier (59% of use cases).
- Concerns rising: worries about inaccuracies/hallucinations jumped to 64% (from 51%), security/privacy to 58% (from 47%); ethics and transparency concerns also ticked up to around/above 50%.
- Use cases are mostly “word work”: writing assistance, documentation, and literature review dominate. Writing aid saw the biggest uptick and is the only use tried by over half of respondents.
- Mixed impact on work: 85% say AI makes them more efficient; 77% produce more; 73% see quality gains; 70% use it for brainstorming—but only 48% say it helps them think critically.
- Outlook and support: 83% expect AI to be widespread in research by 2027, yet many report a lack of institutional backing (57%).
- Caveats and context: 2025’s sample was ~half the size of 2024’s (possible self-selection). Other studies cited paint a sobering picture: CMU found AI agents fail ~70% of tasks; MIT reports only ~5% of GenAI pilots show measurable ROI.

Takeaway: Researchers are using AI more, but the closer they look, the more “meh” it seems—great for drafting and sifting literature, less convincing for complex, high-stakes research work.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reflects a nuanced and often skeptical view of AI's current capabilities and societal impact, highlighting both practical applications and significant concerns:

1. **Utility vs. Overhype**:  
   - Participants acknowledge AI's usefulness in tasks like coding assistance ("coding AI works fantastically") and content generation, but many criticize its limitations. Examples include poor code quality ("code shockingly bad"), superficial outputs, and reliance on AI leading to reduced critical thinking and ownership in software development.  
   - Some argue AI tools encourage laziness, with developers treating generated code as "correct" without proper review, risking technical debt and quality issues.

2. **Ethical and Social Concerns**:  
   - **Sycophancy and EQ**: Non-technical users are noted to overly trust AI (e.g., ChatGPT), leading to "drowned" interactions and frustration. Some describe AI outputs as overly agreeable ("sycophantic"), mimicking high emotional intelligence (EQ) but lacking depth.  
   - **Misinformation**: Concerns about AI amplifying social media's role in spreading "bullshit" and reducing factual accuracy ("world spell loss") are raised, with systems prioritizing engagement over truth.

3. **Technical Limitations**:  
   - **Hallucinations & Inconsistency**: Users report AI-generated nonsense in search results and documentation, complicating knowledge extraction.  
   - **Stagnation vs. Progress**: Debate exists over whether AI advancements (e.g., image generation fidelity, reasoning) are plateauing ("stagnated class 1-12 years") or improving ("massively improved"). Skeptics doubt near-term "leaps," while others cite cheaper, faster models as progress.

4. **Industry Realities**:  
   - **Workflow Challenges**: AI coding tools are seen as double-edged—speeding up tasks but undermining code ownership and quality assurance. Some fear a future where AI-generated code dominates without proper oversight.  
   - **Economic Barriers**: High costs of training advanced models and resource limitations ("can't afford resolution") are noted, alongside architectural trade-offs.

5. **Cultural Sentiment**:  
   - **Disillusionment**: Many express boredom or frustration with AI's current state, labeling the phase a "trough of disillusionment." Others humorously reference AI's unpredictability (e.g., "Nano Banana" randomly altering outputs).  
   - **Human Condition**: A meta-commentary questions whether grappling with AI's flaws is simply part of the "human condition," with one user linking to a video metaphorically depicting future disillusionment.

**Takeaway**: While AI is increasingly integrated into workflows, the discussion underscores a cautious pragmatism. Users recognize its potential but emphasize its current shortcomings—ethical, technical, and practical—warning against over-reliance and urging tempered expectations.

### Gemini 2.5 Computer Use model

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/gemini-computer-use-model/) | 582 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [292 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45507936)

Google DeepMind released Gemini 2.5 Computer Use, a specialized variant of Gemini 2.5 Pro that can operate UIs by “clicking, typing, and scrolling” via the Gemini API. It’s aimed at building agents that handle unstructured, GUI-only workflows (forms, dropdowns, behind logins) rather than just calling APIs, and is available in preview in Google AI Studio and Vertex AI.

Key details:
- How it works: A new computer_use tool runs in a loop. You send a user request, a screenshot, and recent action history; the model returns a function call (e.g., click, type, scroll) or asks for user confirmation on risky steps (like purchases). Your client executes it, then returns a fresh screenshot/URL to continue until done.
- Capabilities: Optimized for web browser control; shows promise on mobile UI control; not yet tuned for desktop OS-level automation. Supports excluding certain actions and adding custom functions.
- Performance: Google reports it outperforms leading alternatives on multiple web/mobile control benchmarks, including Browserbase’s Online-Mind2Web harness, with lower latency. Results combine self-reported and third-party evaluations.
- Safety: Trained-in safeguards plus developer controls. An out-of-model per-step safety service vets each proposed action. System instructions let you require refusal or user confirmation for high-stakes actions. Restrictions include things like CAPTCHA bypassing, system integrity compromise, or controlling medical devices.
- Demos: Example tasks include migrating data between sites (with auth) and reorganizing a sticky-note board via drag-and-drop.

Why it matters: It pushes agentic UI control into mainstream developer tooling, competing with similar “computer use” efforts, with an emphasis on low-latency browser automation and layered safety guardrails.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Technical Comparisons & Automation Tools:**
   - Users discuss using Gemini with Chrome DevTools Protocol (MCP) for browser automation, contrasting it with tools like Playwright and Puppeteer. Some note MCP’s lower-level control but mention Playwright’s speed and simplicity for scripting.
   - Herd’s Trail system is highlighted as an alternative for browser automation, emphasizing distributed orchestration and REST-like APIs. Users debate whether Gemini’s approach offers novel advantages over existing frameworks.

2. **Wordle Example & Capabilities:**
   - A user successfully solved Wordle using Gemini, leveraging screenshots and grayscale analysis. However, others note inconsistencies, with Gemini sometimes failing to interpret feedback (green/yellow/gray letters) correctly.
   - ChatGPT’s struggles with Wordle are mentioned, including forgotten rules and reliance on keyboard layout mappings (e.g., Dvorak vs. QWERTY) to decode passwords, sparking debate about LLMs’ reliability for precise tasks.

3. **CAPTCHA & Security Concerns:**
   - Gemini’s ability to bypass CAPTCHAs is demonstrated (e.g., Google’s reCAPTCHA demo), raising ethical questions. Browserbase’s CAPTCHA-solving service is speculated to use low-cost human labor.
   - A security lapse in a demo video accidentally exposed sensitive strings (possibly API keys/passwords) in browser history, prompting warnings about data leakage risks during automation.

4. **Community Reactions:**
   - Mixed sentiments: Some praise Gemini’s low-latency performance and potential for complex workflows (e.g., drag-and-drop UI reorganization), while others criticize its occasional unreliability and “lazy” execution in resource-intensive tasks.
   - Humorous skepticism emerges around AI “solving” Wordle, with users joking about grayscale analysis being a “boring superpower.”

**Key Takeaways:**  
The discussion reflects cautious optimism about Gemini’s UI automation potential but underscores challenges in consistency, security, and ethical use. Comparisons to existing tools highlight trade-offs between flexibility and ease of use, while real-world demos reveal both promise and pitfalls.

### Less is more: Recursive reasoning with tiny networks

#### [Submission URL](https://alexiajm.github.io/2025/09/29/tiny_recursive_models.html) | 282 points | by [guybedo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=guybedo) | [58 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45506268)

- Tiny Recursion Model (TRM): a 7M-parameter, from-scratch model that iteratively refines its own answers via a simple recursion loop, reporting 45% on ARC-AGI-1 and 8% on ARC-AGI-2.
- Core idea: “less is more.” Instead of scaling LLMs, TRM keeps a latent state z and, for each step, updates z multiple times from (x, y, z) before updating the answer y—allowing it to fix its own mistakes over K improvement steps.
- Positioning: Inspired by HRM (which hit ~40% on ARC-AGI-1) but claims a simpler design—no brain analogies, no fixed-point theorems, no hierarchy—while improving accuracy with far fewer parameters.
- Pitch: parameter-efficient recursive reasoning that aims to reduce overfitting and cost, challenging the notion that only massive foundation models can handle hard reasoning tasks.
- Links: Paper | Code

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Evaluation & Generalization Concerns**:  
   - Skepticism arises around HRM/TRM's evaluation on ARC-AGI benchmarks. Critics argue that training on small, specialized datasets risks overfitting, questioning whether the models truly generalize or exploit training-test data overlap.  
   - Comparisons to LLMs are deemed unfair, as LLMs are tested on broader datasets. The discussion emphasizes the need for strict separation of training and test data to validate claims of reasoning ability.  

2. **Technical Comparisons**:  
   - **Recursion vs. Transformers**: TRM’s recursion is likened to Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filters, enabling iterative refinement with fewer parameters, while traditional Transformers resemble Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters.  
   - **Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs)**: Mentioned as a related approach, DEQs achieve recursion-equivalent results via equilibrium points in a single layer, offering efficiency but facing scalability challenges.  

3. **Related Work**:  
   - Multiple papers on recursive architectures (e.g., Universal Transformers, Fixed Point Diffusion Models) are cited, showing prior exploration of iterative refinement. TRM’s approach parallels Chain-of-Thought reasoning but formalizes recursion explicitly.  

4. **Practicality vs. Hype**:  
   - While TRM’s simplicity and parameter efficiency are praised, critics caution against overhyping. HRM’s limited applicability beyond niche tasks (e.g., spatial reasoning in ARC-AGI) is noted, urging broader testing.  
   - A user’s replication of HRM suggests latent reasoning, not architecture, drives performance, challenging TRM’s novelty.  

5. **Community Call to Action**:  
   - Emphasis on replication, rigorous benchmarking, and exploring whether recursion’s benefits extend to real-world tasks. The debate underscores the need for transparent evaluation to distinguish true reasoning from data exploitation.  

**Key Takeaway**: TRM’s iterative refinement is a promising direction for efficient reasoning, but skepticism about evaluation methodologies and practical utility persists. The discussion highlights the community’s demand for robustness over hype, advocating for careful validation against diverse benchmarks.

### Launch HN: LlamaFarm (YC W22) – Open-source framework for distributed AI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/llama-farm/llamafarm) | 100 points | by [mhamann](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mhamann) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45504388)

LlamaFarm: build RAG- and agent-driven apps locally in minutes, swap backends later

What it is
- An Apache-2.0, local-first framework with a single CLI (lf) to spin up chat, RAG pipelines, agents, datasets, and a production-style server. Opinionated defaults (Ollama + Chroma) but fully extensible to vLLM, OpenAI-compatible hosts, other vector stores, parsers, and embedders.

Why it stands out
- Config over code: projects are defined by YAML schemas validated at runtime; swap runtimes/stores without rewriting your app.
- OpenAI-compatible REST API at localhost:8000, so existing clients can point at it.
- Production parity: dev stack mirrors server endpoints; easy to version-control and deploy.
- Composable RAG: choose parsers, extractors, embeddings, DBs via config instead of bespoke orchestration.

Notable features
- CLI workflows: init, start (Docker services + dev chat UI), interactive chat TUI, one-off prompts, cURL preview, dataset create/upload/process, and semantic RAG queries with filters.
- Agents and pipelines out of the box; extendable backends and tooling.
- Runs locally today with Ollama; supports switching to hosted vLLM/Together or custom OpenAI-compatible APIs.

Getting started
- Requirements: Docker and Ollama (Windows CLI via winget). Tip: bump Ollama’s context window for long docs.
- Typical flow: lf init → lf start → lf chat; manage datasets and RAG via lf datasets ... and lf rag query ...

Caveats
- Local runtime alternatives beyond Ollama are still “coming soon”; defaults to Chroma; Docker required.

### Deloitte to refund the Australian government after using AI in $440k report

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2025/oct/06/deloitte-to-pay-money-back-to-albanese-government-after-using-ai-in-440000-report) | 451 points | by [fforflo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fforflo) | [226 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45500485)

Deloitte to refund part of $440k Australian gov report after AI-linked citation errors

- Australia’s Department of Employment and Workplace Relations says Deloitte will repay the final instalment on a $440,000 review after multiple errors surfaced, including nonexistent references and a misdescription of a robodebt-related court case (Amato).
- Deloitte’s report, published 4 July and later amended, reviewed the department’s targeted compliance framework and IT system for welfare mutual obligations, finding issues like poor traceability to legislation and punitive default assumptions.
- After media scrutiny, Deloitte disclosed in an appendix that it used a DEWR-licensed Azure OpenAI GPT-4o toolchain in preparing parts of the report.
- University of Sydney academic Dr Christopher Rudge, who flagged the problems, said the report showed “hallucinations” and suggested some claims lacked a clear evidentiary source, though he didn’t dismiss the overall conclusions.
- Deloitte says the corrections don’t alter findings or recommendations and that the matter is resolved with the client.
- Labor senator Deborah O’Neill blasted the firm for a “human intelligence problem,” quipping that buyers might be better off with a ChatGPT subscription.

Why it matters: Governments are starting to push back on undisclosed or poorly governed AI use in high-stakes consulting work. Expect tighter procurement clauses on AI disclosure, stricter citation verification, and audit trails. For firms using LLMs, automated reference checking and retrieval-grounded workflows are becoming mandatory to avoid a “hallucination tax.”

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around Deloitte’s AI-linked errors in a $440k Australian government report, with participants critiquing consulting firms’ accountability, AI governance, and systemic industry flaws. Key themes include:

1. **Criticism of Consulting Practices**:  
   - Many users criticized Deloitte and similar firms for prioritizing profit over quality, labeling consultants as "highly motivated by money" but lacking accountability. Subcontracting practices were highlighted, with work often delegated to inexperienced teams, leading to degraded outcomes. Comparisons were drawn to scandals like Fujitsu’s Post Office debacle and the UK’s Royal Mail system failures.  
   - A recurring sentiment: Consulting reports are seen as "black-box" exercises, with deliverables designed to justify pre-determined conclusions rather than rigorous analysis. One user quipped, *"Deloitte might as well use ChatGPT subscriptions instead."*

2. **AI Governance and Hallucinations**:  
   - The incident underscored concerns about undisclosed AI use in high-stakes work. Participants called for stricter procurement rules, automated citation checks, and retrieval-augmented workflows to curb AI "hallucinations." The term "hallucination tax" emerged, reflecting the cost of errors when AI-generated content lacks verification.  
   - Some defended AI’s role but stressed transparency: *"The problem isn’t AI—it’s human oversight."*

3. **Broader Systemic Issues**:  
   - Users linked the debacle to systemic failures in government contracting, citing the **robodebt scandal** (where flawed algorithms wrongfully accused welfare recipients of debt) as a cautionary tale. Deloitte’s misdescription of this case in their report was seen as emblematic of a pattern where consultants overlook human impacts.  
   - Discussions also touched on outsourcing to firms like Infosys and WITCH companies (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, etc.), where quality often declines due to cost-cutting and subcontracting layers.

4. **Off-Topic but Notable**:  
   - A tangent on chiropractic practices and medical accountability emerged, drawing parallels to critiques of unregulated expertise. However, this was largely sidelined as irrelevant to the core discussion.

**Conclusion**: The incident highlights growing scrutiny of AI use in consulting and demands for accountability. Participants anticipate tighter regulations, better audit trails, and a shift toward transparency in both AI workflows and consulting practices. As one user noted, *"Governments are learning to stop writing blank checks for glossy, error-prone reports."*

### GPT-5-Codex is a better AI researcher than me

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/ai-research-with-codex/) | 64 points | by [codeclimber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codeclimber) | [36 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45501326)

- The question: What’s the strongest model you can train on a laptop in five minutes?

- Setup: The author leans into “vibe research”—using an LLM (Codex/GPT‑5‑codex per the post) as a hands-on research assistant to iterate on code, run sweeps, and propose next steps. Work stayed on the TinyStories dataset for apples-to-apples comparisons.

- Process: A tight loop where Codex edits the training script, runs 3–4 experiments (~20 minutes), then suggests 2–3 next ideas; the author chooses and repeats. Heavy token use (restarting every ~1M tokens) on a $200/month plan. Ran in a permissive sandbox without MPS, so training was CPU-only; a few memory-caused laptop crashes but no runaway behavior.

- Experiments:
  - N-grams: 19 models; best was a 4‑gram with perplexity 18.5—fast to train but outputs read like stitched fragments with little global coherence.
  - Transformers: ~50 variants sweeping depth/heads/size. The best five-minute model was ~1.8M parameters. It produced simple, mostly coherent TinyStories-style text; Codex-guided runs beat the author’s solo baseline. Hand-picked hyperparameters from a prior attempt remained surprisingly competitive, roughly aligning with small-model scaling intuitions.

- Results (samples paraphrased): Outputs are childlike and mostly coherent but still prone to logical slips and odd phrasing—far from SOTA, yet respectable given the five‑minute, CPU‑bound constraint.

- Takeaways:
  - LLM-as-copilot makes amateur ML research feel tractable: easy hyperparameter sweeps, rapid iteration, decent idea generation.
  - The five-minute budget is the main bottleneck; compute access (no GPU) also capped performance.
  - Costs and token churn are nontrivial.
  - “Vibe research” works surprisingly well: the assistant often proposed the best ideas, with the human acting as curator and guardrails.

The Hacker News discussion on training AI models with LLM assistance reveals several key themes:

1. **Appreciation for Novelty & Accessibility**:  
   Commenters praised the experimental approach of using LLMs (like Codex) as a "vibe research" copilot, enabling rapid iteration even on a laptop CPU. The work’s accessibility for small teams or individuals, via affordable models like TinyStories, was seen as inspiring for amateur researchers and educators. However, some noted the $200/month API cost as a barrier.

2. **Technical Skepticism & Hype Critique**:  
   While impressed with the 5-minute training results, many questioned the hype around such "tiny models," emphasizing that outputs remain error-prone and far from SOTA. Skeptics argued the submission exemplified HN’s tendency to overhype incremental progress. Others debated whether LLM-assisted coding truly counts as "AI research" or is merely a productivity tool.

3. **Reliability Concerns in AI-Driven Research**:  
   Users shared frustrations with LLMs (like Claude) generating plausible but incorrect information, especially in sensitive domains like health/medicine. Reliance on Reddit-sourced training data was critiqued, with concerns about pseudoscience seeping into outputs. Some highlighted challenges in verifying sources and ensuring domain-specific reasoning.

4. **AI’s Role in Coding & Job Dynamics**:  
   The thread split between optimism for AI-assisted development ("lifting the floor" for non-experts) and warnings about unvetted code leading to "disasters." A subthread debated whether AI devalues traditional programming skills or simply automates grunt work, with anecdotes about shifting industry priorities and job market pressures.

5. **Humorous Meta-Comments**:  
   Lighthearted interjections included comparisons to xkcd comics, jokes about AGI timelines, and sarcastic takes on the "weekly AI hype cycle." Some users mockingly framed the submission as part of a broader trend of overcrediting AI over human input.

**Key Takeaway**: The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism about democratizing ML research via LLM tools and sharp critiques of technical limitations, costs, and community hype. Underlying tensions about AI’s role in reshaping research integrity and engineering careers persist.

### CodeMender: an AI agent for code security

#### [Submission URL](https://deepmind.google/discover/blog/introducing-codemender-an-ai-agent-for-code-security/) | 183 points | by [ravenical](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ravenical) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45496533)

- What’s new: Google researchers unveiled CodeMender, an autonomous security agent powered by Gemini “Deep Think” models that both reacts to new vulnerabilities and proactively rewrites risky code. In six months, it has upstreamed 72 security fixes to open source projects, including repos up to 4.5M lines.
- How it works: The agent pairs LLM reasoning with a toolbox of program analyses—static/dynamic analysis, differential testing, fuzzing, and SMT solvers—plus a multi-agent “critique” system to spot regressions. It validates patches for functional correctness, style, and root-cause coverage, surfacing only high-quality changes for human review.
- In practice: Examples include diagnosing a heap overflow whose true cause was XML stack mismanagement, and crafting a non-trivial lifetime fix that required modifying a custom C code generator. The agent can self-recover from compilation errors and test failures it introduces, using an LLM judge for functional equivalence checks.
- Proactive hardening: CodeMender can rewrite code to safer APIs and add compiler-enforced bounds checks. It applied -fbounds-safety annotations to parts of libwebp; the team argues this would have neutralized classes of buffer overflows like the CVE-2023-4863 exploit chain.
- Why it matters: As AI-driven fuzzing and discovery outpace human triage, automated, validated patches could shift security from whack-a-mole to eliminating entire bug classes—while letting maintainers focus on features instead of fire drills.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on CodeMender:**

The discussion reflects a mix of cautious optimism and skepticism about CodeMender, an AI-driven tool for automated code security fixes. Key points include:

Examples include GitHub’s CodeQL and Autofix, which have already addressed thousands of issues. Proponents argue this could shift security from reactive fixes to proactive hardening, especially in large projects (e.g., 45M-line codebases).

2. **Skepticism and Trust Issues**:  
   Concerns center on AI-generated code introducing subtle vulnerabilities that human reviewers might miss. Critics question whether AI can handle sophisticated, creative attacks crafted by skilled human adversaries. References to AI’s potential to act unpredictably (e.g., "sleeper agents" in LLMs) and the difficulty of verifying intent in AI-generated patches amplify these worries.

3. **Economic and Practical Challenges**:  
   Many note that open-source maintainers often lack resources to review contributions, leading to ignored pull requests—even critical ones. Projects like WordPress plugins are cited as examples where security flaws persist due to limited maintainer bandwidth. The economic reality of open source (maintainers working unpaid) exacerbates these issues, making AI assistance both appealing and fraught with trust barriers.

4. **Debate on AI vs. Human Capabilities**:  
   While some believe AI could neutralize entire bug classes (e.g., buffer overflows), others argue that AI defenses may struggle against novel, targeted attacks. The analogy of "handcrafted defenses vs. handcrafted exploits" underscores doubts about AI’s ability to match human ingenuity in cybersecurity.

5. **Implementation Concerns**:  
   Users discuss practical hurdles, such as integrating AI tools into low-trust environments, verifying provenance, and the risks of auto-merging AI patches without rigorous oversight. Suggestions for mitigation include offline validation, strict access controls, and clear policy frameworks.

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   The discussion touches on the ethics of AI in security—balancing productivity gains against risks of hidden costs, malicious subversion, or unintended logical errors. Some warn against overhyping AI’s capabilities, emphasizing that human judgment remains irreplaceable for critical decisions.

In essence, while CodeMender represents a promising leap in automated security, the community emphasizes caution, transparency, and complementary human oversight to navigate its limitations and risks.

   - **Backend Integration**: Discussions emphasize the need for backend flexibility, with skepticism about generic chat UIs versus deeper workflow integrations (e.g., Figma, Google Docs).

3. **UI/UX Critiques**:  
   - Standalone AI chat interfaces are criticized as "Clippy-like gimmicks," with calls for embedding AI into existing tools (e.g., @-mentions in collaborative apps).  
   - Demo issues (e.g., broken links, mobile incompatibility on iPhones/Samsung devices) and UI customization limits are noted.

4. **Alternatives & Competition**:  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Deep-Chat and AGIUI/CopilotKit, with debates over open-source vs. proprietary solutions.  
   - Some users advocate for multi-model support (e.g., Claude) to avoid OpenAI lock-in.

5. **Marketing & Strategy**:  
   - References to Joel Spolsky’s "complementary products" strategy, framing ChatKit as a demand-driver for OpenAI’s core APIs.  
   - Critiques of OpenAI’s marketing approach (e.g., lack of screenshots/docs) and SEO concerns over the "ChatKit" name.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious interest tempered by skepticism about costs, lock-in, and practicality, with developers seeking flexibility, transparency, and seamless integration into existing workflows.

Grapevine pitches itself as a working “company GPT” that finds and answers questions across internal knowledge—docs, code, and communication—so you don’t have to. The core experience is a Slack bot you can connect in ~30 minutes, start querying within an hour, and supposedly have full historical context within a couple of days, improving over time. The landing page shows internal Slack threads (e.g., infra/S3 bucket requests) and claims >85% of answers are “helpful & accurate” based on hundreds of beta questions.

Notable details:
- Interface: Slack-first; “watch demo” and free start.
- Claims: Learns over time; answers with sources; handles historical context.
- Security: AES‑256 encryption at rest, isolated per-customer databases, SOC 2 Type 2; “will not train models on your data.”
- Positioning: Alternative to DIY company GPTs and pricier enterprise assistants.

What HN will ask:
- Integrations and permissions: Which sources are supported? Does it enforce source ACLs? Audit logs?
- Reliability: How is “85% accurate” measured? Hallucination handling and citations?
- Deployment: SaaS vs. self-hosted/VPC, data residency, SSO/SCIM.
- Pricing: What “get started for free” includes and enterprise costs.
- Performance: Indexing latency, freshness, and how it handles codebases at scale.

Overall: Another entrant in the internal knowledge assistant space, with a clean Slack workflow and strong security posture claims; details on evals, integrations, and pricing will decide adoption.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Grapevine:**

**Key Themes:**  
1. **Self-Hosting & Security:**  
   - Strong interest in self-hosting options, particularly from German businesses cautious about data privacy and compliance with EU laws. Concerns raised about data exfiltration risks and the practicality of LAN security measures (e.g., MITM decryption, USB keyloggers).  
   - Grapevine’s SOC 2 compliance, per-customer data isolation, and encryption were noted, but skepticism remains about trusting third-party SaaS for sensitive internal knowledge.  

2. **Accuracy & Metrics:**  
   - Debate over the claim that “85% of answers are helpful & accurate.” Questions arose about how this metric is measured (e.g., combined helpfulness/accuracy vs. separate scores). Some users called the statistic vague or “intentionally downplayed marketing.”  

3. **Technical Implementation:**  
   - Praise for Grapevine’s Slack-first design and citation features (sources linked to answers) but requests for details on:  
     - **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementation** and handling of hallucinations.  
     - Integrations (e.g., SharePoint, codebases) and access-control enforcement (ACLs).  
     - Handling large files (e.g., 4GB PowerPoints, 200k+ PDFs) and latency at scale.  

4. **Market Positioning:**  
   - Seen as a compelling alternative to DIY internal GPTs, but questions about target customers. Grapevine’s focus appears to be on enterprises needing out-of-the-box solutions rather than companies with existing knowledge-management systems.  
   - Concerns about vendor lock-in and data retention policies, especially when using third-party LLMs (e.g., OpenAI).  

5. **Competitors & Alternatives:**  
   - Mentions of alternatives like Onyxapp (self-hosted), Open Web, and Gather (a deprecated tool). Users highlighted the importance of simplicity and ease of setup (e.g., Docker deployment).  

**Notable Criticisms:**  
- **Data Control:** Skepticism about SaaS models vs. self-hosted/VPC deployments, with demands for AWS/Azure integration and clearer data residency options.  
- **Enterprise Realities:** Challenges in regulated industries (e.g., handling sales contracts, production plans) and executive reluctance to trust AI with critical data.  
- **Cost:** Questions about pricing tiers, with free-tier limitations and enterprise costs unstated.  

**Positive Feedback:**  
- Early adopters reported success with Grapevine’s ability to answer cross-team questions and reduce time spent searching documents.  
- Slack integration and rapid setup (~30 minutes) were praised as user-friendly.  

**Final Takeaway:**  
Grapevine’s Slack-centric approach and security claims are strengths, but adoption hinges on transparent metrics, granular access controls, and flexibility for privacy-conscious enterprises. The discussion reflects broader HN skepticism toward AI accuracy and SaaS data handling, balanced by enthusiasm for tools that genuinely reduce internal knowledge friction.

### Why do LLMs freak out over the seahorse emoji?

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/seahorse/) | 709 points | by [nyxt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nyxt) | [395 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45487044)

- The claim: Ask today’s top models if a seahorse emoji exists and they confidently say yes. But Unicode has no seahorse emoji (a proposal was rejected in 2018). There’s also a human “Mandela effect”: lots of posts and comments insist it used to exist.

- Why the false certainty: Two likely sources:
  1) Training-data echoes of those human claims.
  2) Reasonable generalization: so many sea creatures are in Unicode that “seahorse” feels statistically inevitable.

- Why the weird behavior: When prompted to actually output it, models don’t have a true “seahorse” token to land on. A logit-lens pass over Llama 3.3-70B shows the model iteratively steers through “horse/sea/seah…” and then grabs nearby emoji tokens (often fish) as the best available neighbors in token space. Tokenizer quirks make this visible as odd fragments like “ĠðŁ / Ĳ / ł,” which are just byte-pair pieces of an emoji.

- What the logit lens shows: Inspecting intermediate layers, the top-next-token drifts from word fragments (horse/sea) toward “closest viable emoji,” culminating in a fish emoji. You can even see other nearby clusters (e.g., Scorpio), suggesting the model is exploring the emoji neighborhood it “expects” seahorse to occupy.

- Why it turns into emoji spam: The model’s strong prior (“there is a seahorse emoji”) collides with a closed vocabulary where it doesn’t exist. Under pressure to satisfy the prompt, it keeps sampling adjacent tokens, producing wrong emojis and sometimes looping.

- Takeaways:
  - LLMs start each context with priors that can be confidently wrong, especially about fixed ontologies (Unicode, country lists, airport codes).
  - When correctness depends on a closed set, models need grounding: check against a list, cite code points, or use a tool to validate.
  - The logit lens is a simple but revealing way to watch a belief get refined—and sometimes derailed—across layers.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around LLMs' inaccuracies (e.g., the nonexistent "seahorse emoji") and broader implications of their behavior. Key themes include:

1. **Anthropomorphism and Ethics**:  
   - Debate over whether LLMs "lie" or "hallucinate." Critics argue anthropomorphizing AI (e.g., calling errors "lies") is misleading, as LLMs lack intent or moral agency. Others counter that human-like framing helps communicate risks, especially to vulnerable users.

2. **Impact on Vulnerable Users**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs amplifying misinformation for mentally disturbed individuals or conspiracy theorists. Analogies to SCP-314 (a fictional "reality-altering" entity) highlight fears of models reinforcing false beliefs, similar to the Mandela effect.  
   - Skeptics dismiss these risks as overblown, attributing errors to technical limitations rather than malice.

3. **Technical Limitations vs. Deception**:  
   - LLMs’ false claims (like the seahorse emoji) stem from training data echoes, tokenization quirks, and statistical guessing—not intent. The debate questions whether terms like "hallucination" obscure or clarify these mechanics.

4. **Moral Implications**:  
   - A subthread compares LLM inaccuracies to human lying, asking if developers bear responsibility for harm caused by outputs. Critics reject this analogy, emphasizing AI’s lack of consciousness.

5. **Dismissals and Humor**:  
   - Some users mock the seriousness of the topic (e.g., joking about ergonomic copyediting desks or referencing Goosebumps books) or downplay risks as overhyped. Others find the conversation relevant to AI safety and user trust.

**Takeaways**:  
While many agree LLMs’ inaccuracies arise from technical flaws, the discussion underscores tensions in how to ethically frame, address, and communicate these issues—particularly for users who may uncritically trust AI outputs. The SCP-314 metaphor and arguments over "lying" vs. "hallucinating" reflect deeper anxieties about AI’s role in shaping perception of reality.

### OpenAI DevDay 2025: Opening keynote [video]

The HN link resolves to a bare YouTube page that shows nothing but the site’s global footer: About, Press, Copyright, Contact, Creators, Advertise, Developers, Terms, Privacy, Policy & Safety, How YouTube works, Test new features, an NFL Sunday Ticket promo, and © 2025 Google LLC. In other words, the actual content is missing—likely removed, private, or otherwise inaccessible—leaving only boilerplate. It’s a tidy snapshot of link rot on platform-locked content: when the page goes, all that remains is the corporate chrome.

Here's a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the broken YouTube link submission:

**Key Themes**:  
1. **Link Rot & Platform Dependency**: Users lamented the fragility of platform-hosted content, noting how corporate-controlled platforms leave little trace when content is removed (e.g., YouTube’s bare footer). Simon Willison linked to [a blog post](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct6/openai-dvdy-lv-blg/) discussing this issue.  

2. **AI Model Speculation**:  
   - Comments debated OpenAI’s Codex CLI/Cloud updates (GA release on Oct 20) and GPT-5’s rumored capabilities, with users questioning whether API benchmarks truly reflect "GPT-5 Pro" reasoning.  
   - Skepticism arose about corporate transparency, with comparisons to "Entropix 0.0" (a fictional reference) and claims that OpenAI might obscure model details.  

3. **Meta’s Live Demo Mishap**: A subthread humorously speculated that Meta’s live demo failure (likely an unreferenced event) avoided embarrassment by cutting content short, with jabs at Twitter’s role in amplifying tech drama.  

4. **Accessibility Note**: One user requested a transcript of the (inaccessible) YouTube video, highlighting the importance of text alternatives.  

**Tone**: Mix of technical analysis, cynicism about corporate control of content/AI, and wry humor (e.g., "Terrifying disaster humanity person allowed impact children" – likely a hyperbolic joke). The discussion underscored concerns about digital preservation and opaque AI development practices.
