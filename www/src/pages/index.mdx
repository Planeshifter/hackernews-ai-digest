### Jeff Bezos says AI is in a bubble but society will get 'gigantic' benefits

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/jeff-bezos-ai-in-an-industrial-bubble-but-society-to-benefit.html) | 232 points | by [belter](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=belter) | [521 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45464429)

Jeff Bezos: AI is in an ‚Äúindustrial bubble,‚Äù but the tech is real and will change every industry

- Speaking at Italian Tech Week in Turin, Bezos said today‚Äôs AI boom shows classic bubble signs: valuations detached from fundamentals and ‚Äúevery experiment or idea gets funded‚Äù ‚Äî even a six-person startup landing billions.
- He framed it as an industrial bubble, which he argues can be net-positive: like 1990s biotech, many firms will fail, but the surviving innovations can deliver outsized societal benefits.
- Key quote: ‚ÄúAI is real, and it is going to change every industry‚Ä¶ The benefits to society from AI are going to be gigantic.‚Äù
- He‚Äôs not alone: Sam Altman has called AI bubbly; Goldman Sachs‚Äô David Solomon warned a reset/drawdown is likely; some investors say the ‚ÄúAI trade‚Äù resembles past speculative manias.
- HN angle: Expect froth, megafunding, and eventual shakeout. Builders with real moats and clear economics may outlast the hype; investors should separate durable tech from bubble noise.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Jeff Bezos's AI "Industrial Bubble" Comments**  

The Hacker News discussion revolves around Jeff Bezos‚Äôs assertion that AI is in an "industrial bubble" but will ultimately drive transformative societal benefits. Key themes include:  

1. **Dotcom Bubble Parallels**:  
   - Many commenters draw parallels between today‚Äôs AI boom and past tech bubbles (e.g., Dotcom, telecom), noting that infrastructure investments (e.g., fiber optics, chip manufacturing) often outlive the hype. However, concerns are raised about unsustainable spending on GPU-driven data centers and whether today‚Äôs AI experiments will yield durable value.  
   - Skeptics argue that AI‚Äôs reliance on centralized infrastructure (e.g., proprietary models from Google/Meta) could mirror the Dotcom era‚Äôs "platform capitalism," where tech giants extract rents as intermediaries. Others counter that decentralized, open-source LLMs might democratize access.  

2. **Social and Economic Impacts**:  
   - Technology‚Äôs "time-saving" benefits (e.g., online shopping, digital bureaucracy) are acknowledged, but critics highlight unintended consequences: social isolation, reduced face-to-face interaction, and challenges for non-digital-native populations (e.g., elderly struggling with complex systems).  
   - Wealth inequality and corporate control are recurring worries. Some argue AI could exacerbate these trends by concentrating power in firms with resources to train large models, while others see potential for innovation to uplift productivity in fields like healthcare or climate modeling.  

3. **Global Case Studies**:  
   - India‚Äôs telecom reforms and U.S. urban decay (e.g., San Francisco‚Äôs homelessness crisis) are cited as examples of how tech progress coexists with societal dysfunction. The discussion reflects broader anxieties about Western decline and the uneven distribution of tech‚Äôs benefits.  

4. **AI‚Äôs Practical Applications**:  
   - Optimists list promising use cases: weather prediction, drug discovery, low-cost gaming, and energy grid optimization. However, skeptics question whether current GPU investments in AI data centers are justified, given the speculative nature of many projects.  

5. **Debate Over Centralization**:  
   - A tension emerges between centralized AI systems (e.g., closed models from Big Tech) and decentralized alternatives. Some users warn that AI agents controlled by corporations could replicate the exploitative dynamics of social media algorithms, while others advocate for open-source models to prevent monopolistic control.  

**Conclusion**: While commenters generally agree with Bezos‚Äôs view that AI‚Äôs foundational technology is here to stay, the discussion reflects skepticism about the sustainability of current hype and funding. Infrastructure durability, equitable access, and avoiding past mistakes (e.g., unchecked corporate power) are emphasized as critical to realizing AI‚Äôs potential. The sentiment leans toward cautious optimism, tempered by lessons from history.

- **Integration Issues**: While Jules‚Äô CLI composability is praised, some prefer isolated environments (e.g., sandboxed VMs) to avoid exposing sensitive data or systems.

### **Comparisons & Alternatives**
- **Claude Code vs. Jules**: Users debate their strengths, with some switching to Claude Code for its scriptable API and perceived reliability. Others argue Jules‚Äô TUI and Gemini integration make it more polished for specific workflows.
- **GitHub Copilot**: Mentioned as a superior alternative for code generation, though Jules‚Äô focus on CI/CD automation differentiates it.

### **Broader Opinions on AI Coding**
- **Optimism**: Some believe AI agents will save significant time for repetitive tasks (e.g., dependency updates, test generation) and evolve into indispensable tools.
- **Skepticism**: Critics argue current LLMs lack domain-specific reliability, often produce "broken code," and risk disrupting functional systems. Concerns about AI replacing engineers are dismissed as premature, though automation of junior tasks is acknowledged.

### **Miscellaneous**
- **Naming Critiques**: Users mock the trend of anthropomorphized AI tool names (e.g., "Jules") as confusing or gimmicky.
- **Future Outlook**: Predictions range from AI agents becoming core devtools within 3 years to remaining niche aids requiring heavy oversight.

### Email was the user interface for the first AI recommendation engines

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/blog/ringo-email-as-an-ai-interface) | 77 points | by [coloneltcb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=coloneltcb) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45465392)

Before Spotify‚Äôs algorithms, the hottest ‚ÄúAI‚Äù music recommender ran on email. In 1994, thousands of people sent their favorite artists to a bot called Ringo and got back eerily on-point suggestions. It felt like artificial intelligence‚ÄîCory Doctorow later said ‚Äúhalf the music in my collection came out of Ringo‚Äù‚Äîbut under the hood it was simple social filtering: average the tastes of people who like what you like and redistribute the results.

The piece traces that lineage: MIT‚Äôs Paul Resnick (building on Thomas Malone) framed the core idea that ‚Äúpeople who agreed in the past are likely to agree again.‚Äù Xerox PARC‚Äôs Tapestry (1992) let readers ‚Äúendorse‚Äù messages so others could filter by trusted humans. Stanford‚Äôs SIFT (1994) brought it to the masses via the one universal UI everyone had then: email. In an era of exploding web content and scarce storage, human-in-the-loop signals‚Äîreads, replies, deletes‚Äîbecame the substrate for discovery.

Why it matters: Today‚Äôs recommendation engines and ‚ÄúAI‚Äù copilots still rest on that same collaborative-filtering spine. The 90s showed two enduring truths: email is a great distribution layer for new interfaces, and crowdsourced judgment can feel like intelligence long before the math gets fancy.

Here‚Äôs a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the early AI recommender systems like Ringo and their legacy:

### Key Themes from the Discussion:
1. **Nostalgia & Simplicity**:  
   Users reminisced about early systems like **Gnoosic**, **Gnooks**, and **Gnovies**, which relied on basic collaborative filtering via email. Despite their simplicity, they often delivered eerily accurate recommendations (e.g., suggesting Procol Harum‚Äôs *A Whiter Shade of Pale*). Their interfaces were rudimentary but functional, relying on user corrections for typos (e.g., fixing "The Beatled" to "The Beatles").

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - **Typos and Input Issues**: Users had to manually correct misspelled artist or song names (e.g., ABBA vs. ‚ÄúArgent‚Äù), highlighting the lack of auto-correction in early systems.  
   - **Email as Interface**: Before APIs, services like **TREARN** on Bitnet used email commands to process requests (e.g., `GET ftp://...`), trickling responses back in chunks.  

3. **Historical Context**:  
   - Early systems like **MORSE** (Movie Recommendation SystEm) and **Firefly** pioneered collaborative filtering. Firefly‚Äôs patent on the algorithm later sparked debates about ownership, especially after Microsoft acquired the tech. Users lamented how such foundational ideas weren‚Äôt monetized effectively by their creators.  
   - **Patents and Regrets**: A user shared regrets about not patenting their collaborative filtering algorithm, drawing parallels to today‚Äôs AI patent battles (e.g., ChatGPT‚Äôs rise vs. older systems).  

4. **AI vs. Statistics Debate**:  
   Some argued that collaborative filtering was more about **statistics** (e.g., averaging user preferences) than ‚Äútrue AI,‚Äù critiquing the article‚Äôs framing of it as groundbreaking AI. Others countered that its effectiveness at scaling human judgment made it revolutionary for its time.

5. **Impact and Legacy**:  
   Despite flaws, these systems shaped modern recommendation engines. Users praised services like **Gnoosic** for introducing them to niche artists (e.g., Melody Gardot, Hugh Masekela). The discussion also touched on how early email-based UIs laid groundwork for today‚Äôs notification-driven apps.

### Memorable Quotes:
- **On Simplicity**: *‚ÄúHalf my music collection came from Ringo‚Äù* (Cory Doctorow, referenced).  
- **On Legacy**: *‚ÄúMicrosoft kept the patent drawer closed‚Ä¶ today‚Äôs LLMs can‚Äôt math, but they‚Äôll sure patent it.‚Äù*  
- **On Patents**: *‚ÄúA single individual‚Äôs patent [5,749,081] sold barely‚Ä¶ now imagine that applied to the entire internet.‚Äù*

The thread blended admiration for these pioneering systems with critiques of their limitations and the broader implications for AI‚Äôs evolution.

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/17065099) | 43 points | by [gmays](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gmays) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45468579)

A multi-disciplinary group of academics urges universities to stop treating AI as a default add-on and start treating skepticism as a legitimate stance. They argue we‚Äôre repeating past tech mistakes (tobacco, combustion engines, social media) by rolling out AI tools without consent or debate‚Äîe.g., non-optional software updates and chatbots bundled into suites like Microsoft Office.

Key points:
- Core claim: Universities must actively counter vendor marketing and hype, scrutinize harms, and protect higher education‚Äôs core values‚Äîcritical thinking, expertise, academic freedom, and scientific integrity.
- Consent and choice: Staff and students often can‚Äôt opt out; rejecting AI tools is treated as invalid in teaching and research.
- Context: Expands a June 2025 Open Letter calling on institutions to reverse/rethink uncritical AI adoption; includes references for colleagues.
- Traction: Zenodo preprint (CC BY 4.0) has seen ~66.6k views and ~40.6k downloads within days.

Why HN cares: It hits perennial themes‚Äîproduct bundling, consent in software deployment, institutional governance, and the line between ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù and infrastructure capture.

Link: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17065099

The Hacker News discussion on the preprint critiquing uncritical AI adoption in academia revolves around several key themes, blending substantive critiques with ideological debates:

1. **Historical Skepticism**:  
   Commenters reference past critiques of AI, such as the 1980s "AI winter" and works by philosophers like Hubert Dreyfus, highlighting long-standing ethical and technical doubts about AI. Mentions of 20th-century Marxist critiques and climate change parallels (e.g., inaction despite early warnings) underscore recurring patterns of institutional complacency.

2. **Political Ideologies**:  
   The thread devolves into debates about communism vs. capitalism, with some users dismissing terms like "communist" as Cold War-era propaganda. Others argue that critiques of AI are entangled with capitalist dynamics, citing historical atrocities (e.g., Belgian colonialism) to question whether technology‚Äôs harms stem from systemic exploitation rather than ideology.

3. **Academia‚Äôs Role**:  
   Participants debate whether scientists and institutions bear responsibility for resisting corporate-driven tech trends. Comparisons to climate change inaction suggest frustration with academia‚Äôs delayed response to societal threats. Some defend scientists as constrained by institutional pressures, not complacency.

4. **AI‚Äôs Practical Shortcomings**:  
   Users critique current AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT‚Äôs inaccuracies) as emblematic of overhyped, underperforming technology. Anecdotes about AI failures in research or teaching highlight concerns that deploying flawed tools without consent undermines academic integrity.

5. **Meta-Discussion on AI Summarization**:  
   Skepticism arises about using AI itself to parse the discussion, with users mocking ChatGPT‚Äôs potential to misinterpret nuanced debates or reproduce biases.

**Takeaway**: The conversation reflects broader tensions around trust in institutions, the ethical governance of technology, and AI‚Äôs societal impact. While some engage deeply with historical and philosophical contexts, others derail into ideological sparring, illustrating the polarized discourse surrounding AI adoption.

### Fp8 runs ~100 tflops faster when the kernel name has "cutlass" in it

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton/pull/7298) | 333 points | by [mmastrac](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mmastrac) | [151 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45458948)

Triton merges ‚Äúpersistent attention‚Äù tutorial/kernel, touts big low-context gains and strong FP8

The Triton team landed a sizable change set (93 commits) introducing a persistent-kernel rewrite of their attention tutorial (python/tutorials/gluon/01-attention-forward.py). Persistent kernels keep thread blocks resident on SMs to cut launch overhead and improve cache reuse‚Äîtypically a win at small/medium sequence lengths.

Highlights
- Performance: Author reports better throughput at low contexts after the rewrite. FP8 generally outpaces FP16 across tested shapes; e.g., with Z=4, H=32, D=128:
  - Non‚Äëcausal: FP16 roughly 0.72‚Äì1.06 ‚ÄúTFLOPs‚Äù vs FP8 ~0.71‚Äì1.52 as N_CTX scales 1K‚Üí65K
  - Causal: FP16 ~0.36‚Äì1.19 vs FP8 ~0.35‚Äì1.41
- Regressions: FP16 at large contexts took a hit due to a ptxas instruction scheduling quirk in the softmax partition. Expect follow-ups or workarounds.
- Quirky note: ‚ÄúFP8 is ~100 TFLOPs faster when the kernel name has ‚Äòcutlass‚Äô in it,‚Äù a tongue-in-cheek observation that hints at toolchain/profiler oddities.
- Baseline context: For posterity, the author shared pre-persistent results (including cuDNN FP16, which was ahead in many cases). Post-merge tables focus on Triton FP16/FP8; no new cuDNN comparison yet.
- Process: 93 commits spanning kernel tweaks and type-system internals (e.g., making aggregates mutable), with reviews approved and a lively thread reaction.

Why it matters: Persistent attention aligns Triton‚Äôs tutorial path with production-style kernels that shine at small batch/short sequence inference‚Äîcommon in real workloads. FP8 momentum continues, but FP16 long-context performance may need compiler or kernel-level fixes.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the challenges and ethics of software/hardware optimizations, spurred by Triton‚Äôs merge of a "persistent attention" kernel. Key points include:

1. **Optimization Challenges**:  
   - Users note that compiler and GPU kernel optimizations (like those in Triton) are unpredictable, often yielding mixed results. Non-NVIDIA systems face particular difficulties due to opaque performance modeling.  
   - Historical frustrations with Java and C++ compilers are cited, where aggressive optimizations sometimes caused regressions or maintenance nightmares, leading to skepticism about relying on experimental flags.

2. **Ethical Concerns and Historical Scandals**:  
   - AMD/ATI‚Äôs past manipulation of *Quake III* benchmarks is highlighted: Renaming the executable (`quake3.exe` ‚Üí `quack.exe`) triggered driver optimizations, boosting benchmark scores at the cost of actual texture quality.  
   - Comparisons to Intel‚Äôs compiler controversy (favoring "GenuineIntel" CPUs) and Volkswagen‚Äôs emissions scandal underscore the fine line between optimization and deceit.  

3. **Vendor Practices**:  
   - NVIDIA‚Äôs driver-level tweaks (e.g., application-specific settings in its control panel) are discussed as both beneficial and contentious, blurring the line between optimization and "hijacking" rendering logic.  
   - Vulkan‚Äôs driver protocol is critiqued as fragile, enabling vendors to inject game-specific optimizations that risk breaking compatibility.

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Users debate the morality of prioritizing benchmarks over real-world performance, noting that while optimizations are necessary, they shouldn‚Äôt degrade user experience or transparency.  
   - The discussion reflects skepticism about "aggressive" optimizations (like Triton‚Äôs FP8 gains) if they sacrifice stability or rely on opaque, vendor-specific quirks.

**Conclusion**: The thread underscores the tension between performance gains and ethical engineering, advocating for optimizations that balance speed, transparency, and user trust.

### Microsoft CTO says he wants to swap most AMD and Nvidia GPUs for homemade chips

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/01/microsoft-wants-to-mainly-use-its-own-ai-chips-in-the-future.html) | 183 points | by [fork-bomber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fork-bomber) | [127 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45463642)

Microsoft wants to run mostly on its own chips long term, says CTO Kevin Scott. While Azure today relies heavily on Nvidia (and some AMD), Scott said Microsoft will ‚Äúentertain anything‚Äù for capacity now, but the goal is ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù to use mainly Microsoft silicon in its data centers.

What‚Äôs new:
- Microsoft is already deploying its custom Azure Maia AI Accelerator (for AI) and Cobalt CPU, and is working on next-gen parts.
- It‚Äôs also rolling out ‚Äúmicrofluid‚Äù cooling to tackle thermals as power densities rise.
- Strategy shift is about whole-system design: silicon, networking, and cooling tuned to specific AI workloads.

Why it matters:
- Another strong signal that hyperscalers aim to reduce dependence on Nvidia/AMD and optimize cost/performance with in-house chips.
- Could pressure GPU pricing and margins over time, though near-term demand keeps Nvidia in pole position.

The bottleneck:
- Compute capacity remains the limiter. Scott called the shortage a ‚Äúmassive crunch,‚Äù saying even Microsoft‚Äôs most ambitious forecasts keep undershooting post-ChatGPT demand.
- Big Tech capex is set to top $300B this year, much of it for AI infrastructure, with Microsoft planning even more capacity in the coming years.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around Microsoft‚Äôs push for in-house AI chips and broader trends in custom silicon development among tech giants. Key themes and debates include:

### **1. Historical Context & Competing Approaches**
- **Google‚Äôs TPUs** are cited as an early example (2015) of hyperscalers developing custom AI accelerators. Users note TPUs evolved for both training and inference, with Broadcom and Marvell playing roles in their production. Some debate whether Google‚Äôs Gemini models rely entirely on TPUs or hybrid GPU/TPU setups for flexibility.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs Track Record**: Comments highlight past projects like *Project Brainwave* (FPGA-based AI acceleration) and Azure‚Äôs Catapult FPGA infrastructure. Skeptics question Microsoft‚Äôs credibility compared to Apple‚Äôs successful in-house silicon (e.g., M-series chips), while others defend Azure‚Äôs long-term hardware investments.

### **2. Technical Debates**
- **TPUs vs. GPUs**: A contentious thread argues whether TPUs are superior for training LLMs. Some claim Google uses TPUs for 99% of internal AI workloads, while others note GPUs remain critical for compatibility, rapid iteration, and frameworks like PyTorch. JAX/XLA‚Äôs role in Google‚Äôs software-hardware synergy is highlighted.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs MAIA Chip**: Users discuss the MAIA 100 (designed for transformers) and skepticism around its performance versus Nvidia‚Äôs GPUs. Some tie Microsoft‚Äôs urgency to its OpenAI partnership and the need to reduce reliance on Nvidia amid supply shortages.

### **3. Company Strategies**
- **Resource Shifts**: Microsoft‚Äôs reallocation of Xbox engineers to AI accelerators sparks discussion about prioritizing AI over gaming hardware. Critics question if this reflects a broader cultural shift.
- **Graphcore‚Äôs Failure**: Microsoft‚Äôs investment in Graphcore (a startup with specialized AI chips) is deemed a misstep, with users blaming high costs, limited software support, and Nvidia‚Äôs dominance. Graphcore‚Äôs large SRAM-focused design is seen as impractical for scaling.

### **4. Hardware Design & Innovation**
- **Custom Silicon Trends**: Comparisons to Apple‚Äôs PA Semi acquisition and TSMC‚Äôs role in enabling bespoke designs. Users debate whether hyperscalers‚Äô in-house chips will pressure Nvidia‚Äôs pricing or remain niche.
- **Analog & Subthreshold CMOS**: A tangent explores experimental analog ML accelerators and academic research into low-power designs, though most agree these are impractical for large models due to memory bottlenecks.

### **5. Market Implications**
- **Consumer Impact**: Some hope in-house chips will lower GPU prices for consumers, but others doubt it, noting hyperscalers‚Äô focus on cost-cutting, not consumer markets. Nvidia‚Äôs ‚Äúmoat‚Äù (CUDA ecosystem, Grace Hopper GPUs) is seen as durable despite competition.

### **Key Disagreements**
- **TPU Dominance**: Strong claims about Google‚Äôs internal TPU reliance clash with observations that GPUs are still needed for compatibility and rapid development.
- **Microsoft‚Äôs Credibility**: Divided opinions on whether Microsoft can replicate Apple‚Äôs silicon success or will struggle due to institutional inertia.
- **Nvidia‚Äôs Future**: While most agree Nvidia faces long-term pressure, near-term demand and software dominance (CUDA, PyTorch) are seen as insurmountable advantages.

Overall, the discussion underscores the strategic and technical complexities of shifting AI compute to custom silicon, with mixed optimism about its impact on innovation and market dynamics.

**Key Themes**:  
Debate centers on how data structure (tree vs. flat, nested vs. explicit), model size, and semantic context interact‚Äîunderscoring that "best format" likely depends on task constraints and the LLM‚Äôs ability to infer relationships.

### Writing an LLM from scratch, part 20 ‚Äì starting training, and cross entropy loss

#### [Submission URL](https://www.gilesthomas.com/2025/10/llm-from-scratch-20-starting-training-cross-entropy-loss) | 29 points | by [gpjt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gpjt) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45455648)

Giles continues his hands-on walkthrough of Sebastian Raschka‚Äôs ‚ÄúBuild a Large Language Model (from Scratch)‚Äù by kicking off training and demystifying the loss function. After seeding PyTorch for reproducible toy outputs, he zeroes in on how next-token prediction maps to training targets and why cross-entropy is the natural choice.

Key points:
- Shifted targets finally click: an input like ‚ÄúThe fat cat sat on the‚Äù corresponds to predicting each next token from every prefix (‚ÄúThe‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú fat‚Äù, ‚ÄúThe fat‚Äù ‚Üí ‚Äú cat‚Äù, ‚Ä¶). That means one sequence yields many training examples.
- Treat each prefix independently: whether batch size is one or many, each prefix-logits vector is compared against a single target token, so the loss aggregates over all prefix positions in the batch.
- Why cross-entropy: it measures how wrong the model‚Äôs predicted distribution (softmax of logits) is relative to the true next token; zero if perfectly right, higher when off. This dovetails with gradient descent for parameter updates.
- Reproducibility as a sanity check: manual seeding ensures the book‚Äôs examples match exactly while you wire up the training loop.

Why it matters:
- This installment bridges the conceptual gap between ‚Äúshift-left‚Äù targets and per-token supervision, setting up the mechanics for a correct, stable loss over batch and time dimensions‚Äîthe backbone of training any next-token LLM.

The discussion highlights technical nuances of training LLMs with shifted labels and cross-entropy loss, mirroring concepts from the submission:

1. **Self-supervised training mechanics**:  
   User `lpldj` explains that the training corpus uses shifted input-label pairs (e.g., input "The" ‚Üí label "fat", input "The fat" ‚Üí label "cat"), akin to Hugging Face‚Äôs approach where labels are shifted left by one token. Cross-entropy loss compares model logits against these shifted labels. They note that padding tokens (e.g., "-1") and sequence lengths must align with this structure.

2. **Efficiency of token prediction**:  
   In reply, `blackbear_` emphasizes that next-token prediction inherently computes loss efficiently across all tokens in a single forward pass, avoiding per-token iteration overhead.

3. **Resource link**:  
   User `asimovDev` shares a link to Part 1 of Giles‚Äô series for context.

**Key takeaway**: The thread underscores practical implementation details (shifted labels, batch alignment) and computational efficiency inherent to LLM training, directly tying into the submission‚Äôs focus on cross-entropy loss mechanics.

### Y'all are over-complicating these AI-risk arguments

#### [Submission URL](https://dynomight.net/ai-risk/) | 51 points | by [bobbiechen](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bobbiechen) | [93 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45451971)

Dynomight argues for a simpler, more persuasive case for AI risk: imagine 30 small, unarmed aliens landing on Earth‚Äîeach with an IQ of 300. Most people would be concerned without needing a step-by-step disaster model, and that intuition should transfer to AGI. He contrasts this with the ‚Äúcomplex‚Äù argument (fast takeoff ‚Üí convergent subgoals ‚Üí decisive strategic advantage ‚Üí catastrophe), calling its strong form overconfident and its weak form incomplete about what happens if any step fails. He offers an ‚Äúinverted‚Äù challenge to skeptics: to deny AI risk, you must bite one of three bullets‚Äîaliens with IQ 300 would be fine; 300-IQ AI won‚Äôt arrive in coming decades; or AI will definitely have some property that prevents all alien-like harms‚Äîwhich he deems untenable. The simple analogy, he says, avoids niche abstractions, shifts focus from demanding specific failure modes (like asking exactly how a car crash will happen before buckling up), and reveals the true crux of disagreement.

**Summary of the Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the credibility of AI existential risk warnings, with participants split between taking the analogy of "300-IQ aliens" seriously and dismissing it as hyperbolic or self-serving. Key points include:

1. **Skepticism of AI Doomsday Scenarios:**
   - Some users (e.g., BeetleB) argue that fears of AI "taking over humanity" resemble past exaggerated anxieties (e.g., job loss predictions) or fringe beliefs like "Roko's Basilisk" (a thought experiment about AI punishing non-cooperation). Critics dismiss these as irrational or irrelevant to modern AI discourse.
   - Others, like hllrth, counter that legitimate concerns are held by influential figures in AI research (e.g., Geoffrey Hinton, Yoshua Bengio) and organizations (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), not just fringe groups. They emphasize that the risk debate is grounded in technical realities, not abstract paranoia.

2. **Influence of Silicon Valley Culture:**
   - Participants note that "Rationalist" philosophy (e.g., Eliezer Yudkowsky‚Äôs ideas) has permeated Silicon Valley, with figures like Shane Legg (DeepMind co-founder) and Dario Amodei (Anthropic CEO) shaping AI safety discourse. Elon Musk and Grimes are cited as examples of celebrities tangentially tied to these ideas.
   - Critics allege financial motives behind AI risk warnings, comparing them to climate change lobbying by energy companies. Some accuse AI leaders like Sam Altman of leveraging doomsday narratives to attract regulation favoring their firms.

3. **Expert Consensus vs. Individual Bias:**
   - Pro-risk users highlight statements signed by prominent figures (e.g., Altman, Hinton, Bengio) advocating for AI risk mitigation as a global priority. They argue these warnings are based on technical insights, not fearmongering.
   - Skeptics (e.g., hh) question the sincerity of these warnings, noting the trillion-dollar incentives for AI firms to shape regulatory narratives. BeetleB dismisses Hinton‚Äôs 50% existential risk estimate as "picking numbers out of thin air."

4. **Government and Societal Response:**
   - Some express concern about overreach, such as government-enforced restrictions on AI development stifling innovation. Others counter that without regulation, runaway AI could disrupt economies, empower bad actors, or lead to human disempowerment.

5. **Cultural Divides:**
   - The thread reflects broader cultural tensions between "tech bubble" perspectives (dismissing AI risk as abstract) and research-driven caution. References to historical Rationalist community drama (e.g., the dissolution of CFAR) underscore the charged, often personal nature of the debate.

**Takeaway:** The core disagreement centers on whether AI risk is a legitimate technical challenge requiring urgent action or a mix of financial opportunism, philosophical hyperbole, and misplaced analogies. Both sides appeal to authority figures and historical parallels but remain divided on the plausibility of catastrophic outcomes.

### NL Judge: Meta must respect user's choice of recommendation system

#### [Submission URL](https://www.bitsoffreedom.nl/2025/10/02/judge-in-the-bits-of-freedom-vs-meta-lawsuit-meta-must-respect-users-choice/) | 321 points | by [mattashii](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mattashii) | [231 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448326)

Dutch court: Meta must honor users‚Äô non-profiled feed choice under the DSA

- What happened: Dutch digital rights group Bits of Freedom won a summary judgment against Meta. A judge found Meta in breach of the EU‚Äôs Digital Services Act (DSA) for failing to offer a persistent, user-controlled alternative to profiling-based feeds on Instagram and Facebook.

- Key findings: The court said a ‚Äúnon-persistent choice option‚Äù contradicts the DSA‚Äôs goal of giving users genuine autonomy and control, and that Meta‚Äôs current design ‚Äúsignificantly disrupts‚Äù user autonomy.

- Order: Meta must adjust its apps so that if a user selects a non-profiled feed, that choice is preserved across sections and after app restarts‚Äîi.e., the apps can‚Äôt silently revert to the profiling-based feed.

- Context: Bits of Freedom argued Meta nudges users toward an interest/behavior-based feed (core to its ads model) by hiding the non-profiled option, defaulting back to the profiled feed on open, and degrading the alternative timeline (e.g., reduced access to features like Direct Messages).

- Why it matters: This is an early test of the DSA‚Äôs user-control provisions and a rebuke of ‚Äúdark pattern‚Äù design. If it sticks, expect UI changes for EU users, pressure on other platforms to offer persistent non-profiled feeds, and fresh scrutiny ahead of elections.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the recent Dutch court ruling against Meta, sparking debates about privacy, subscriptions, and corporate practices. Key points include:

1. **Subscription Model Criticisms**:  
   Users express frustration with mandatory subscriptions, seen as barriers that drive people away. Workaccount2 argues that platforms like Instagram force credit card entries for basic features, labeling it "greedy." Others note low conversion rates (e.g., Nebula‚Äôs 1%) and resentment toward paying for services perceived as surveilling users.

2. **Privacy and Tracking Concerns**:  
   Many highlight Meta‚Äôs reliance on targeted ads and data profiling. jfngl points out how even minor design barriers (e.g., login prompts) nudge users toward tracking-heavy feeds. ypgy and others debate whether phones listen to conversations for ads, with some dismissing it as paranoia while others share anecdotal suspicions.

3. **Legal and Regulatory Solutions**:  
   Calls for laws to curb surveillance capitalism. jkjk advocates legislation forcing companies to "lose money" if they breach privacy, while Imustaskforhelp emphasizes holding firms accountable through fines. There‚Äôs skepticism about enforcement, given historical leniency toward tech giants.

4. **Open-Source Alternatives**:  
   Discussions on open-source platforms (e.g., PeerTube) as privacy-centric alternatives. However, users acknowledge challenges in adoption due to resource constraints and mainstream preferences for convenience over security.

5. **Value of Content vs. Data**:  
   Debates erupt over Meta‚Äôs value: dlsnl argues Facebook‚Äôs content is "worthless" but its data trove is gold for advertisers. Others compare it to entertainment services like Netflix, where subscriptions are justified only if users actively consume content.

6. **Corporate Influence on Democracy**:  
   Imustaskforhelp and others critique big tech‚Äôs outsized influence, urging systemic changes to rebalance power. Concerns include algorithmic manipulation, hidden data practices, and the need for transparency to protect democratic processes.

7. **Anecdotes and Alternatives**:  
   Rubyn00bie shares mixed experiences with Nebula and Disney+, questioning subscription worth based on usage. Rootnod3 suggests decentralized models to reduce reliance on centralized platforms like YouTube.

**Conclusion**:  
The thread reflects widespread distrust of surveillance-based business models, with demands for legal accountability, ethical design, and viable alternatives. While opinions vary on solutions (laws vs. open-source adoption), there‚Äôs consensus on the urgency to prioritize user autonomy over corporate profits.

### The Answer (1954)

#### [Submission URL](https://sfshortstories.com/?p=5983) | 33 points | by [dash2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=dash2) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453299)

Fredric Brown‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Answer‚Äù (1954) revisited: universe-scale AI becomes God, still a gimmick?
A short blog review revisits Brown‚Äôs one-page classic: a scientist links every computer across 96 billion inhabited planets into a single super-intelligence, asks about God, and gets an unnervingly literal answer‚Äîfollowed by a lethal anti‚Äìkill switch response. The reviewer finds it a neat twist when you‚Äôre 12 but a thin gimmick as an adult; the true wonder is the audacity of a cosmos-spanning network.

Why it matters for HN
- Proto-AI parable: anticipates emergent intelligence from networked systems and the futility of the off-switch.
- Early sci-fi lens on AGI, alignment, and theological framings of superintelligence.
- A reminder how mid-century flash fiction seeded memes later echoed in Colossus, The Last Question, and modern AI discourse.

Bottom line: The twist may feel dated, but the scale‚Äîand the questions it raises about connected computation and godlike agency‚Äîremain strikingly contemporary.

The Hacker News discussion on Fredric Brown‚Äôs *The Answer* (1954) highlights contrasting views and thematic connections:  

1. **Nostalgia vs. Modern Perception**:  
   - Some users fondly recall the story‚Äôs impact in their youth but critique its twist as ‚Äúgimmicky‚Äù by today‚Äôs standards, arguing younger readers might not find its AI-as-God premise surprising. Others defend its enduring audacity and influence on sci-fi tropes.  

2. **Comparisons to Classic Sci-Fi**:  
   - Parallels are drawn to Asimov‚Äôs *The Last Question* (1956) and Arthur C. Clarke‚Äôs *The Nine Billion Names of God* (1953), both exploring cosmic-scale computation and existential questions. Confusion arises over Asimov‚Äôs title, clarified via a Wikipedia link.  

3. **Modern Tech and Marketing Hype**:  
   - IBM‚Äôs quantum computing marketing (e.g., the ‚ÄúIBM Quantum System‚Äù glass cube) is cited as a real-world analogy to the story‚Äôs themes. Skeptics argue such campaigns overhype ‚Äúdeification‚Äù of technology, masking practical limitations.  

4. **Recommendations and References**:  
   - Ted Chiang‚Äôs *Exhalation* and Andy Weir‚Äôs *Project Hail Mary* are recommended for nuanced takes on AI and cosmic questions. A direct link to Brown‚Äôs story and Wolfram Alpha‚Äôs 2010 launch are shared as contextual anchors.  

5. **Broader Themes**:  
   - Participants debate humanity‚Äôs tendency to anthropomorphize technology and ponder whether networked systems (like the story‚Äôs universe-spanning AI) challenge our understanding of agency and divinity.  

**Takeaway**: While the story‚Äôs twist may feel dated, its legacy‚Äîand the questions it raises about interconnected computation, existential hubris, and AI‚Äôs theological implications‚Äîresonate in both sci-fi and real-world tech discourse.

### Gemini 3.0 Pro ‚Äì early tests

#### [Submission URL](https://twitter.com/chetaslua/status/1973694615518880236) | 208 points | by [ukuina](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ukuina) | [121 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453448)

X (Twitter) is showing an error gate that says, ‚ÄúSomething went wrong‚Ä¶ Try again,‚Äù followed by, ‚ÄúSome privacy related extensions may cause issues on x.com. Please disable them and try again.‚Äù In practice, it nudges users to turn off ad/tracker blockers or other privacy tools before the site will load. The move underscores the growing tension between platforms that rely on tracking and users who browse with privacy protections, and could degrade access for those who keep extensions or stricter browser settings enabled.

The discussion revolves around AI model training, benchmark reliability, and challenges in generating SVG content, alongside critiques of Google's strategic approach compared to Apple:

1. **AI Benchmark Concerns**:  
   - Users debate whether AI labs "cheat" by overfitting models to public benchmarks (e.g., SVG images of pelicans/bicycles), rendering them ineffective for real-world tasks.  
   - Private benchmarks are suggested as more reliable, but critics argue even these may not cover edge cases. Simon Willison‚Äôs quirky SVG-based benchmark is cited as an example of tests that might not reflect practical AI capabilities.  

2. **SVG Generation Challenges**:  
   - Skepticism exists about AI‚Äôs ability to generate coherent SVGs, given their complexity compared to PNGs. Some argue current models (like ChatGPT) struggle with vector graphics, though future multimodal models (e.g., GPT-6) may improve.  
   - Anecdotes highlight failures in generating specific SVG combinations (e.g., "pelican riding a bicycle"), with outputs often being nonsensical or low-quality.  

3. **Google vs. Apple UX Critique**:  
   - Google is criticized for disjointed user experiences (e.g., removing location-based reminders on Android) and failing to integrate AI/ML tools cohesively, unlike Apple‚Äôs polished ecosystem.  
   - Comments suggest Google‚Äôs focus on standalone tech over unified consumer experiences harms their competitiveness, despite having advanced AI research.  

4. **Miscellaneous Points**:  
   - Speculation about AI training data scarcity for niche SVG content and whether labs manually generate such data.  
   - Humorous takes on AI-generated absurdities (e.g., "surfboard-reading pyramids") underscore the gap between benchmark performance and real-world utility.  

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism about current AI benchmarks, technical hurdles in SVG generation, and frustration with Google‚Äôs fragmented product strategy.

### Meta will listen into AI conversations to personalize ads

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/01/meta_ai_use_informs_ads/) | 203 points | by [Bender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bender) | [67 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45448839)

Meta will mine Meta AI chats (text and voice) to personalize content and ads starting December 16, 2025 ‚Äî with no opt-out for most users

What‚Äôs happening
- Meta will use conversations with its AI across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the web to tune recommendations and ads. Example: chat about hiking ‚Üí more hiking groups, posts, and boot ads.
- Notifications roll out October 7, 2025. The change takes effect December 16, 2025.
- No opt-out. Users can only tweak Ads Preferences and feed controls.
- Carve-outs: Meta says it won‚Äôt personalize ads from AI chats that touch religion, sexual orientation, politics, health, race/ethnicity, philosophical belief, or trade union membership.
- Regional exemptions: EU, UK, and South Korea are excluded for now.

Why it matters
- This is a major platform explicitly mining AI chat content ‚Äî including voice ‚Äî for ad targeting at scale, tightening Meta‚Äôs closed-loop data and reducing outside visibility into targeting inputs.
- Watchdogs warn this could further obscure Meta‚Äôs attribution models and limit independent auditing of ad effectiveness.
- Context: Meta remains overwhelmingly ad-driven (98% of its $165B 2024 revenue; $62.4B net income) and is pitching enormous AI spend (Zuckerberg has talked up hundreds of billions through 2028).

Backdrop
- Meta faces a $7B class action from advertisers alleging inflated reach (Meta disputes the claim).

What to watch
- Regulatory pushback, especially if exemptions widen or sensitive-topic filters misfire.
- How reliably ‚Äúsensitive topics‚Äù are detected, particularly in voice conversations.
- Advertiser and user reaction to diminished transparency vs. higher engagement promises.

If you‚Äôre concerned
- Avoid using Meta AI features inside Meta apps.
- Review Ads Preferences and limit microphone permissions for Meta apps.
- Consider non-Meta messaging or AI tools for sensitive queries.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The debate revolves around Meta's plan to use AI chat data for ad targeting and broader concerns about AI's societal impact, particularly regarding "victim mentality" and tech platforms' control.

1. **Meta's AI and Data Use Concerns:**
   - Participants liken Meta's actions to dystopian scenarios, expressing fears about unchecked data mining and AI's role in manipulating user attention and emotions. Critics argue this consolidates power for tech oligarchs, reducing transparency and user autonomy.

2. **Victim Mentality Debate:**
   - **Critics (e.g., FloorEgg):** A pervasive "victim mindset" risks fostering societal division, blame-shifting, and reduced accountability. They cite historical conflicts (e.g., ethnic tensions, extremist movements) where victim narratives perpetuated cycles of violence and stagnation. AI could amplify this by spreading such mentalities.
   - **Defenders (e.g., bccd):** Acknowledging victimhood is legitimate in cases of systemic oppression (e.g., suffragettes, Holocaust victims). Distinguishing between harmful victim mentality and justified grievances is crucial, as dismissing all victimhood can suppress valid dissent.

3. **AI's Role in Societal Control:**
   - Concerns include AI's potential to manipulate emotions, control narratives, and deepen societal divides. Examples include platforms promoting dissatisfaction to retain user engagement, limiting constructive dialogue, and enabling authoritarian regimes to exploit narratives.

4. **Historical and Contemporary Examples:**
   - References to Nazi Germany, suffragettes, and ethnic conflicts illustrate the tension between legitimate victim identification and destructive cycles of grievance. Participants debate whether AI will exacerbate these issues or if ethical frameworks can mitigate risks.

**Key Takeaways:**
- The discussion highlights fears about tech platforms like Meta exploiting data to manipulate behavior, intertwined with broader anxieties about AI's societal impact.
- A central tension exists between recognizing legitimate victimhood and avoiding harmful narratives that hinder progress.
- Participants stress the need for ethical AI development, transparency, and user agency to prevent dystopian outcomes.

### Email immutability matters more in a world with AI

#### [Submission URL](https://www.fastmail.com/blog/not-written-with-ai/) | 158 points | by [brongondwana](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brongondwana) | [106 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45453135)

Fastmail CEO: Email as ‚Äúelectronic memory‚Äù in an AI-saturated world

- Bron Gondwana (Fastmail CEO) argues that as AI makes it easier to rewrite the web‚Äîand, by extension, ‚Äúhistory‚Äù‚Äîemail‚Äôs immutability becomes more valuable. Unlike web pages, your copy of an email can‚Äôt be silently edited later, serving as a reliable personal record.

- He embraces AI as a tool but warns against uncritical use. A personal aside about his son refusing AI for university work underscores the value of building real skills, not outsourcing them.

- Customer stance: Use AI with your own Fastmail data if you want, provided it doesn‚Äôt violate the ToS or harm service performance.

- Staff policy: Strict guardrails for any AI use:
  - Data protection and privacy must be upheld (including with vendors using AI for translation/abuse detection).
  - Human accountability: AI output must be reviewed and understood, with second-set-of-eyes checks.
  - Bias/hallucination awareness.
  - Human-in-the-loop authority for any automated decisions.

- Reaffirmation of long-held principles (since 2016): Your data is yours; Fastmail positions itself as a steward enabling you to use it as you choose. The subtext: in a world of fluid, AI-edited content, local, immutable email archives matter more than ever.

**Summary of Discussion on Email Immutability and AI Challenges**

The discussion revolves around the tension between email‚Äôs perceived immutability and modern practices that undermine it, alongside broader concerns about AI‚Äôs impact on trust in digital content. Key points include:

1. **Email Immutability Limitations**  
   - **Remote Content**: While email copies are static, embedded remote content (e.g., images, tracking pixels, or dynamic links) can change or disappear, altering how emails are displayed over time. Examples include Gmail‚Äôs integration with Google Docs (which updates links) and Microsoft Loop components that modify email content post-delivery.  
   - **Dynamic vs. Plain Text**: HTML emails with remote resources are criticized for enabling tracking and dependency on external servers. Plain-text emails are advocated as a more reliable, static alternative.  

2. **AI and Trust in Digital Records**  
   - **Deepfakes and Manipulation**: Participants express concern about AI‚Äôs ability to create convincing forgeries (text, images, video), eroding trust in digital evidence. Cryptographic signatures and watermarking are proposed solutions but face skepticism about mainstream adoption.  
   - **Legal and Social Implications**: Worries arise about AI-altered evidence in legal contexts, juror bias, and the societal shift toward a "post-truth" landscape where verification is increasingly difficult.  

3. **Technical and Practical Challenges**  
   - **Client Behavior**: Email clients like Gmail pre-fetch and cache content, complicating immutability. Some users advocate disabling remote content loading to preserve email integrity.  
   - **Modern Email Features**: Dynamic elements (e.g., marketing trackers, AMP emails) conflict with the ideal of immutable archives, pushing users toward simpler email practices.  

4. **Tie to Fastmail‚Äôs Argument**  
   - While Fastmail emphasizes email‚Äôs value as a personal, immutable record, the discussion highlights real-world limitations. Participants stress the need for stricter standards (e.g., static snapshots of emails, plain-text adoption) to align practice with the ideal.  

**Key Takeaway**: Email‚Äôs immutability is nuanced‚Äîits text-based core is reliable, but modern dependencies on dynamic content and AI‚Äôs broader threat to digital trust underscore the need for intentional design (e.g., avoiding remote resources) and robust authentication frameworks to preserve its archival value.

### Building the heap: racking 30 petabytes of hard drives for pretraining

#### [Submission URL](https://si.inc/posts/the-heap/) | 389 points | by [nee1r](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nee1r) | [264 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45438496)

DIY beats the cloud (by a lot): 30 PB video store for ML at $1/TB/month

- The pitch: Training models on 90M hours of video dwarfs text LLM data needs, so storage‚Äînot compute‚Äîbecame the bottleneck. Instead of paying ~$12M/yr on AWS, a 5-person team racked their own disks in a downtown SF colo for ~$354k/yr all-in (~40x cheaper).
- Why on-prem works here: Pretraining data is commodity. They can tolerate corruption and don‚Äôt need ‚Äú13 nines.‚Äù Losing 5% of samples is fine, so enterprise-grade redundancy is overkill.
- The build: ~30 PB using 2,400 used 12TB enterprise HDDs in 100 NetApp DS4246 JBODs, 10 head nodes, an Arista router, and 100 Gbps DIA from Zayo.
- Costs:
  - Recurring: Internet $7.5k/mo, power (incl. space/cooling) $10k/mo
  - One-time capex: $426.5k (mostly drives), depreciated over 3 years
  - Total: ~$29.5k/mo ($1/TB/mo)
- Cloud comparisons:
  - AWS: ~$1.13M/mo ($38/TB/mo; includes 10 PB/mo egress)
  - Cloudflare R2 (bulk): ~$270k/mo ($10/TB/mo), but they‚Äôve hit metadata rate limits under heavy training loads
- Ops choice: Picked a pricier SF colo over cheaper Fremont to keep hands-on work close to the office and reduce productivity drag.
- Takeaway: For data-heavy AI, storage and egress dominate. If you can accept lower durability and manage some hardware, stacking used drives in a local colo can 10‚Äì40x your cost efficiency versus major clouds.

**Summary of Discussion:**

1. **Cost Efficiency & Cloud Comparisons:**
   - Participants highlight the significant cost savings of DIY storage (40x cheaper than AWS) but note that negotiating with cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Cloudflare) for bulk discounts could reduce the gap. Some argue cloud pricing remains prohibitive for large-scale AI training.

2. **Hardware & Colocation Choices:**
   - The team‚Äôs use of **used enterprise HDDs** and JBODs sparked debate on reliability vs. cost. Some suggest alternatives like Supermicro or Backblaze Storage Pods for higher density. The choice of a pricier SF colo over Fremont was defended for proximity and productivity benefits.

3. **Drive Reliability & Failure Rates:**
   - Concerns about drive failures were addressed with references to Backblaze‚Äôs annual reports (~1.36% failure rate). Discussions noted the "U-shaped" failure curve (higher early/late failures) and stressed the importance of diversified suppliers to mitigate risks.

4. **Networking & GPU Bottlenecks:**
   - Questions arose about 100 Gbps networking sufficiency for training. Replies clarified that preprocessing data minimizes bottlenecks, and GPUs are housed separately (likely in cloud/power-dense locations due to colo power limits).

5. **Hetzner & Alternative Providers:**
   - Hetzner‚Äôs storage solutions were debated‚Äîpraised for cost but criticized for support and arbitrary data deletion policies. Some recommended local colos for better control and connectivity.

6. **Operational Insights:**
   - Anecdotes shared on managing drive failures (e.g., scripting RAID recovery) and the trade-offs of enterprise vs. consumer drives. Emphasis on testing (SMART, write verification) and accepting lower durability for cost savings.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **DIY storage** is viable for AI/ML teams willing to trade durability for cost, leveraging used hardware and colocation.
- **Cloud costs** remain high for bulk storage, but negotiation and alternative providers (e.g., Cloudflare R2) can help.
- **Drive management** requires proactive failure handling and supplier diversity.
- **Community experiences** with providers like Hetzner and Backblaze inform practical decisions, balancing cost, risk, and support.

### Unix philosophy and filesystem access makes Claude Code amazing

#### [Submission URL](https://www.alephic.com/writing/the-magic-of-claude-code) | 380 points | by [noahbrier](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=noahbrier) | [200 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45437893)

The Magic of Claude Code (Noah Brier) ‚Äî why a terminal turns an LLM into an OS

- Brier describes how Claude Code went from ‚Äúnice coding aid‚Äù to his day-to-day agentic operating system‚Äîespecially for managing an Obsidian vault. He even runs it on a home server and SSHs in from his phone to read/write notes on the go.

- The unlock isn‚Äôt just code generation‚Äîit‚Äôs running in a terminal with native Unix tools. Simple, composable commands (pipes, grep, sed, etc.) align with how LLMs naturally chain tools, making them surprisingly effective operators.

- Filesystem access is the other breakthrough. Unlike browser chat UIs with no persistent memory and tight context windows, Claude Code can write to disk, keep running tallies, accumulate knowledge, and retain state across sessions.

- He contrasts it with Cursor/ChatGPT: not necessarily ‚Äúbetter‚Äù at everything, but the combination of Unix + filesystem makes Claude Code feel qualitatively different and more reliable for building new workflows on top.

- Cites The Pragmatic Engineer‚Äôs deep dive and Boris Cherny‚Äôs ‚Äúproduct overhang‚Äù idea: the model could already reason this way; products just hadn‚Äôt exposed the capability. Claude Code does, offering a blueprint for practical agentic workflows.

- Big picture: even without smarter models, better product surfaces (like terminals and filesystems) can unlock a lot of latent capability.

The Hacker News discussion around Noah Brier‚Äôs Claude Code submission highlights several key themes and critiques:

### Key Themes
1. **Practical Workflow Integration**  
   Users praised Claude Code‚Äôs ability to streamline debugging, log analysis, and scripting via Unix-like composability. Examples include diagnosing industrial device logs, automating Obsidian vault management, and generating scripts for repetitive tasks (e.g., refactoring code, translating text). The terminal-centric design and filesystem access were seen as transformative for agentic workflows.

2. **Comparison to Alternatives**  
   While Claude Code was contrasted favorably with tools like Cursor or ChatGPT for CLI-centric tasks, some noted it isn‚Äôt universally superior. AWS CLI and Terraform were cited as prior examples of terminal-driven tooling, emphasizing principles like least-privilege IAM policies.

3. **AI‚Äôs Role in Programming**  
   Debates emerged about whether LLMs like Claude can replace traditional programming workflows. Users observed that while humans naturally build tools incrementally, LLMs often brute-force solutions, leading to fragile code. Static analysis tools (linters, formatters) were deemed critical for catching errors LLMs might miss.

### Critiques and Challenges
- **Edge-Case Failures**: A user shared an anecdote where Claude insisted on using Bash for FreeBSD (which lacks native Bash), highlighting AI‚Äôs occasional rigidity or incorrect assumptions.
- **Skipped Validations**: Frustration arose when Claude Code skipped pre-commit checks (e.g., linters, tests) or generated code that "passed" tests without meaningful validation. One user joked that an AI skipping Rust tests ‚Äúknows it‚Äôs Friday.‚Äù
- **Tooling Limitations**: Projects like `Mansnip` (STDIO wrappers) faced technical hurdles, such as Debian packaging issues, underscoring the gap between prototype and production-ready tools.

### Humor and Skepticism  
Comparisons to Clippy (‚ÄúClippy with Unix pipes‚Äù) and quips about AI ‚Äúpredicting weekend deployments‚Äù reflected mixed enthusiasm. While some lauded Claude‚Äôs efficiency, others questioned its reliability for complex tasks, emphasizing the need for human oversight.

### Bottom Line  
The discussion reinforced Brier‚Äôs thesis: terminal and filesystem access unlock latent LLM potential, but practical adoption requires balancing automation with robust error-checking and tooling maturity.

### The RAG Obituary: Killed by agents, buried by context windows

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nicolasbustamante.com/p/the-rag-obituary-killed-by-agents) | 244 points | by [nbstme](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nbstme) | [160 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45439997)

The RAG Obituary: Why bigger context windows and agents may kill today‚Äôs RAG stack

- The pitch: Nicolas Bustamante (ex-Doctrine, now Fintool) argues that retrieval‚Äëaugmented generation is entering its twilight as context windows explode and agent-based systems mature. The costly machinery of chunking, embeddings, and rerankers is being outpaced by models that can ‚Äújust read‚Äù far more of the source material and reason with it via agents.

- Why RAG took off: Early LLMs like GPT‚Äë3.5/4 had tiny windows (4k‚Äì8k tokens), forcing systems to retrieve slivers of large documents (e.g., a 10‚ÄëK at ~51k tokens) and have the model synthesize answers from fragments.

- Where it breaks: He details the practical failures:
  - Chunking fractures meaning (splitting policies, tables, and narrative-context links), even with sophisticated, metadata-rich schemes.
  - Embeddings are blunt for domain nuance (e.g., conflating ‚Äúrevenue recognition‚Äù vs. ‚Äúrevenue growth‚Äù), returning boilerplate, duplicates, stale or irrelevant mentions.
  - Reranking and retrieval heuristics fight endless edge cases because the model never sees the whole document.

- His team‚Äôs best efforts still hit the wall: Fintool preserves hierarchy, keeps financial tables atomic, links notes and footnotes, tracks periods and sections‚Äîyet the core problem remains: you‚Äôre feeding fragments, not documents.

- The bet going forward: As context windows grow and agentic workflows mature, the need for chunking/embedding/rerank stacks diminishes. Instead of assembling context via retrieval, agents with large contexts can ingest full sections or entire filings and reason across them directly.

Bottom line: RAG solved an architectural constraint. If that constraint disappears, much of today‚Äôs retrieval stack becomes overhead. Bustamante‚Äôs contrarian take: the future of enterprise AI looks less like vector databases and rerankers‚Äîand more like long-context models orchestrated by agents.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around the "RAG Obituary" submission reflects skepticism about the claim that RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is dying, with nuanced debates on its evolution versus obsolescence:

1. **Criticism of the Premise**:  
   Many argue that RAG‚Äôs core principles (retrieving external data to augment LLMs) remain relevant even as context windows grow. Some note that **grep-like keyword searches** (fast, precise) and **vector/semantic searches** serve different needs, and RAG‚Äôs hybrid approaches (e.g., blending BM25 with embeddings) address limitations of pure keyword or semantic methods.

2. **Practical Use Cases for RAG**:  
   Users highlight scenarios where RAG excels, such as searching across **millions of documents** or **distributed systems** where ingesting entire corpora into context windows is impractical. Others emphasize RAG‚Äôs role in **domain-specific tasks** (e.g., financial filings) where preserving document structure and semantic nuance matters.

3. **Semantic vs. Keyword Search**:  
   Debate centers on whether RAG inherently requires vector search. Some argue RAG is broader, encompassing any retrieval method (keyword, regex, hybrid), while others equate it with vector databases. Hybrid systems (e.g., BM25 + embeddings) are seen as evolving RAG, not replacing it.

4. **Agents vs. RAG**:  
   Skepticism arises about agents being a "replacement." Many see agentic workflows as **extensions of RAG** (e.g., iterative query refinement, dynamic context pulling) rather than a paradigm shift. The line between "RAG with rerankers" and "agents" blurs in practice.

5. **Technical Trade-offs**:  
   - **Cost/latency**: Large context windows (e.g., 2M tokens) are expensive and slow compared to optimized retrieval pipelines.  
   - **Rerankers**: While criticized for latency, lightweight rerankers (e.g., cross-encoders) are cheaper than LLM-based ranking.  
   - **Chunking**: Still necessary for granularity, even with larger contexts, to avoid overloading models with irrelevant data.

6. **Definitional Disputes**:  
   Critics accuse the original article of narrowly defining RAG as "vector databases," ignoring its broader utility. Some suggest the term is becoming diluted, with vendors rebranding existing techniques (e.g., semantic search) as "agentic."

**Key Takeaway**:  
The consensus leans toward RAG **evolving** (e.g., integrating agents, hybrid search) rather than dying. Larger context windows and agents may reduce reliance on *specific* RAG components (e.g., chunking), but retrieval-augmented workflows will persist in scalable, cost-sensitive, or domain-specific applications. The future likely involves **hybrid systems** combining the best of RAG, agents, and long-context models.

### OpenTSLM: Language models that understand time series

#### [Submission URL](https://www.opentslm.com/) | 261 points | by [rjakob](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rjakob) | [77 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45440431)

OpenTSLM: making time a first-class modality for AI. The team proposes ‚ÄúTime-Series Language Models‚Äù (TSLMs) that treat temporal data as a native modality alongside text, aiming to directly reason, explain, and forecast over signals like heartbeats, sensor streams, prices, and logs in natural language. They claim order-of-magnitude gains in temporal reasoning while running on smaller, faster backbones.

Key points:
- What‚Äôs new: A foundation model class centered on time series as input/output, not just an add-on to LLMs. Targets reasoning, forecasting, and explanations over temporal data.
- Release status: White paper released Sep 30, 2025; Stanford repo on Oct 1, 2025. ‚ÄúOpen core‚Äù base models trained on public data, plus ‚ÄúFrontier‚Äù proprietary models for enterprise.
- Why it matters: Real-world systems are driven by continuous signals; most current LLMs struggle with temporal structure and streaming. A robust TSLM could enable proactive healthcare, adaptive robotics, and resilient infrastructure.
- Compared to prior art: Lands amid growing ‚Äúfoundation models for time series‚Äù work (e.g., TimesFM, Chronos, PatchTST). The distinctive claim is native multimodality with time series + text and strong temporal reasoning on smaller models.
- What to watch: Benchmarks and datasets used, evaluation tasks (reasoning vs forecasting vs anomaly detection), sequence length and streaming latency, licensing of ‚Äúopen‚Äù models, and whether repos reproduce the reported gains.

Team includes researchers from ETH, Stanford, Harvard, Cambridge, TUM, CDTM, and major AI labs; they‚Äôre the paper‚Äôs original authors.

The discussion around OpenTSLM reveals a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism, focusing on technical feasibility, real-world applications, and limitations:

### **Key Debates & Insights**
1. **ECG Analysis & Edge Deployment**
   - A user questioned if OpenTSLM could reliably run on edge devices (e.g., heart monitors) given hardware constraints. The paper‚Äôs smaller 270M-parameter model requires 7GB RAM, still exceeding typical smartphone capabilities (6-8GB). Critics argue real-time deployment remains challenging without specialized hardware.

2. **Pattern Detection vs. Clinical Context**
   - While OpenTSLM claims advanced pattern recognition (85% accuracy with clinical context vs. 65% without), skeptics note this relies on curated templates and annotated datasets. Detecting subtle signals (e.g., heart arrhythmias) may still lag behind domain-specific algorithms validated in clinical trials.

3. **Financial Data Challenges**
   - Non-stationary signals (e.g., stock prices) pose unique hurdles compared to stationary medical data. Users highlight difficulties in detecting regime shifts or encrypted trading signals, questioning if TSLMs can adapt to rapidly changing, noisy financial environments.

4. **Causality & Interpretability**
   - Granger causality and causal discovery are flagged as underaddressed challenges. Some argue LLMs‚Äô script-calling approach (e.g., invoking signal-processing libraries) risks being a ‚Äúheavy lift‚Äù versus native temporal reasoning.

5. **Architecture & Technical Tradeoffs**
   - The model‚Äôs 1D convolutional cross-attention architecture is praised for capturing subtle patterns, but skeptics question if constrained architectures can generalize across domains (e.g., ECGs vs. stock data). Comparisons to vision-language models (e.g., Flamingo) suggest parallels in modality fusion.

6. **Release & Licensing Quirks**
   - A typo in the release date (‚ÄúSep 31, 2025‚Äù) sparked humor, with users noting the irony for a time-centric project. Concerns linger about the ‚Äúopen core‚Äù licensing and reproducibility of results from the Stanford repo.

### **Notable Perspectives**
- **Optimism**: Researchers praise OpenTSLM‚Äôs potential for proactive healthcare and infrastructure monitoring, citing its novel fusion of time-series and language modalities.
- **Skepticism**: Critics stress hardware limitations, domain specificity, and the gap between academic benchmarks and real-world deployment (e.g., financial data‚Äôs unpredictability).
- **Middle Ground**: Some suggest hybrid approaches, combining TSLMs with traditional statistical methods or domain-specific algorithms for reliability.

### **Conclusion**
While OpenTSLM introduces promising advances in temporal reasoning, its success hinges on overcoming hardware barriers, proving generalizability across non-stationary domains, and addressing causality challenges. The discussion underscores the tension between academic innovation and practical deployment constraints.

### High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi Mapping

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10605) | 135 points | by [oldfuture](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=oldfuture) | [35 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45434941)

LatentCSI: high‚Äëres images from WiFi signals using a pretrained diffusion model

Researchers propose LatentCSI, a method that turns WiFi channel state information (CSI) into images by mapping CSI amplitudes directly into the latent space of a pretrained latent diffusion model (LDM). The diffusion model then denoises in latent space‚Äîoptionally guided by a text prompt‚Äîbefore decoding to a high‚Äëresolution image. This sidesteps pixel‚Äëspace generation and avoids training a heavy image generator or a separate image encoder.

Key points
- How it works: a lightweight neural net maps CSI amplitudes ‚Üí LDM latent; the frozen LDM performs denoising with optional text guidance; the pretrained decoder produces the final image.
- Why it matters: leverages powerful vision priors in pretrained LDMs to get higher‚Äëquality, controllable images from commodity WiFi data with far less compute.
- Results: on an in‚Äëhouse wide‚Äëband CSI dataset (off‚Äëthe‚Äëshelf WiFi + cameras) and a subset of MM‚ÄëFi, LatentCSI outperforms similarly lightweight baselines trained on images in both perceptual quality and efficiency, and supports text‚Äëguided controllability.
- Efficiency angle: training focuses on a small mapper network; inference occurs in compact latent space, reducing cost versus pixel‚Äëspace GAN/diffusion approaches.
- Caveats: reconstructions rely heavily on the diffusion model‚Äôs priors and training alignment; risk of hallucinations and limited generalization across environments/devices; details like through‚Äëwall capability aren‚Äôt claimed.
- Privacy/ethics: turning ambient WiFi into plausible images raises surveillance concerns despite potential benefits in robotics, smart homes, and sensing.

Paper: High-resolution efficient image generation from WiFi CSI using a pretrained latent diffusion model (arXiv:2506.10605, Ramesh & Nishio)

The discussion around generating high-resolution images from WiFi signals using a diffusion model (LatentCSI) reveals several key themes:

### **Skepticism & Technical Concerns**
1. **Accuracy & Hallucination**: Many question whether the model genuinely reconstructs images from WiFi data or relies on the diffusion model‚Äôs priors to "hallucinate" plausible details (e.g., clothing colors, object placement). Critics argue WiFi signals lack explicit visual data (e.g., color), making reliable inference doubtful.
2. **Overfitting**: Concerns that results are overfitted to limited training environments (specific rooms, angles, or hardware) and may not generalize to unseen scenarios.
3. **Bandwidth Limitations**: While higher WiFi bandwidth (e.g., 160MHz) provides more data points, critics doubt it suffices for high-resolution image generation, with one noting it‚Äôs akin to ‚Äúpredicting a 3D scene from 1992 input points.‚Äù

### **Ethical & Privacy Implications**
- **Surveillance Risks**: Users highlight dystopian implications, such as erosion of privacy via ambient WiFi becoming a surveillance tool. One commenter calls it a ‚Äúscrubber of human privacy,‚Äù noting potential misuse in monitoring health or activities.
- **Ethical Dilemmas**: Concerns about deploying such technology without safeguards, especially given its potential to infer sensitive details.

### **Technical Counterpoints & Clarifications**
- **Efficiency & Novelty**: Supporters praise the method‚Äôs efficiency by mapping WiFi data to a pretrained latent diffusion model‚Äôs space, enabling faster training and text-guided generation. Authors clarify that the model focuses on small, environment-specific adaptations rather than full retraining.
- **Material Properties vs. Color**: Debates arise over whether WiFi signals (which interact with material dielectric properties) can correlate with visual colors. Some argue materials‚Äô spectral responses don‚Äôt align with RGB colors, making accurate color inference unlikely.

### **Reproducibility & Practicality**
- **Hardware Challenges**: Discussions note the difficulty of extracting reliable CSI data from commodity hardware, citing tools like ESP32 or custom drivers for Intel NICs. Skeptics argue real-world deployment is far from trivial.
- **Dataset Transparency**: Critics request public datasets and reproducible setups, with one user sarcastically offering $1 to see the setup generate accurate images.

### **Author Responses**
- The authors (via a commenter) defend the approach, emphasizing its speed, efficiency, and potential for rapid adaptation to new environments. They acknowledge limitations in generalization but highlight applications in robotics or smart homes.

### **Miscellaneous Reactions**
- **Amazement vs. Cynicism**: Some find the results ‚Äúinsane‚Äù and revolutionary, while others dismiss it as ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù or overhyped AI.
- **Cultural References**: A commenter poetically likens the tech to ‚ÄúLight Days,‚Äù evoking a future where quantum physics erases privacy.

### **Conclusion**
The discussion reflects a mix of fascination with the technical innovation and deep skepticism about its practicality, accuracy, and ethical implications. While the method is seen as a promising leap in wireless sensing, critics demand more rigorous validation, transparency, and ethical safeguards before accepting its real-world viability.

### DARPA project for automated translation from C to Rust (2024)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.darpa.mil/news/2024/memory-safety-vulnerabilities) | 133 points | by [alhazraed](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=alhazraed) | [177 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45443368)

DARPA is launching TRACTOR (Translating All C to Rust), a program to substantially automate converting legacy C into safe, idiomatic Rust to wipe out memory-safety bugs at their source. The agency cites the dominance of memory-safety vulnerabilities and the limits of bug-finding tools, along with a cultural shift toward Rust and recent LLM breakthroughs, as the moment to try this at scale‚Äîespecially given DoD‚Äôs deep C codebase. Program manager Dan Wallach says today‚Äôs LLMs can already do decent C‚ÜíRust translations ‚Äúbut not always‚Äù; TRACTOR aims to combine static/dynamic analysis with LLMs to match what a skilled Rust developer would produce and will run public competitions to benchmark progress. The effort aligns with calls from ONCD and CISA to move to memory-safe languages, with the promise of reducing a major class of security flaws across long-lived systems. Proposers Day was set for Aug 26, 2024 (registration by Aug 19).

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around DARPA's TRACTOR initiative to automate C-to-Rust translation, with mixed reactions and debates on feasibility, trade-offs, and alternatives:

1. **Existing Tools & Challenges**:  
   - Tools like **C2Rust** and **Metalift** are cited as early attempts at translation, but users note limitations (e.g., C2Rust can produce "buggy" code).  
   - Automated translation must preserve performance-critical behavior and avoid introducing errors, which remains difficult for complex codebases (e.g., JPEG 2000 decoders).  

2. **Memory Safety Claims**:  
   - Skepticism arises about whether Rust‚Äôs **static checks** (e.g., borrow checker) fully address memory safety versus **runtime checks** in alternatives like Fil-C (hypothetical language?).  
   - Fil-C is debated as a runtime-checked "memory-safe C," but some argue it sacrifices performance and doesn‚Äôt eliminate undefined behavior (UB) entirely.  

3. **Alternatives to Rust**:  
   - Users question why DARPA prioritizes Rust over languages like **Swift, Zig, or C++-with-changes**, citing diverse opinions in the ecosystem.  
   - Fil-C (or similar approaches) could theoretically avoid Rust‚Äôs steep learning curve while adding safety via instrumentation, but trade-offs in runtime overhead are noted.  

4. **Performance vs. Safety Trade-offs**:  
   - Projects requiring **low-level control** (OS kernels, game engines) may reject Rust due to runtime costs, favoring Fil-C or C-with-instrumentation.  
   - **Rust‚Äôs static checks** are praised for preventing vulnerabilities like use-after-free (UAF), but critics argue they‚Äôre insufficient for all memory-safety issues (e.g., logic errors).  

5. **Practicality of Rewriting**:  
   - Rewriting legacy systems in Rust is seen as labor-intensive, with risks of **regressions** and unclear benefits for performance-sensitive code.  
   - Some argue the effort would be better spent on **instrumentation tools** (e.g., ASAN) or gradual adoption of safer language subsets.  

6. **Cultural & Ecosystem Factors**:  
   - Fil-C adoption is deemed unlikely due to the momentum behind Rust and its growing community (‚ÄúRustaceans‚Äù).  
   - Debates highlight tensions between **‚Äúrewrite everything in Rust‚Äù** enthusiasm and pragmatic acceptance of incremental improvements to existing C/C++ codebases.  

**Key Takeaway**: While TRACTOR‚Äôs goals align with broader security priorities, the discussion underscores skepticism about fully automated translation, advocacy for alternative approaches, and unresolved debates over performance-safety trade-offs in memory-safe language adoption.

### Evaluating the impact of AI on the labor market: Current state of affairs

#### [Submission URL](https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/evaluating-impact-ai-labor-market-current-state-affairs) | 139 points | by [Bender](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Bender) | [175 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45442743)

AI and jobs: broad labor-market disruption hasn‚Äôt shown up yet

- Scope: 33 months after ChatGPT‚Äôs release, researchers compare how the U.S. occupational mix has shifted versus past tech waves (computers, internet), and test whether AI ‚Äúexposure/automation/augmentation‚Äù metrics correlate with employment or unemployment changes.

- Main finding: No discernible economy‚Äëwide job disruption so far. The occupational mix is changing slightly faster than in past episodes, but not by much‚Äîand much of the shift predates generative AI‚Äôs rollout.

- Context: In the late ‚Äô90s/early 2000s internet era, the occupational mix was ~7 percentage points different after six years; today‚Äôs change is only about 1 point higher on a comparable basis.

- Exposure ‚â† outcomes (yet): Occupations rated as highly exposed to AI don‚Äôt show systematic differences in employment or unemployment trends so far.

- Industry view: Information, Financial Activities, and Professional/Business Services show somewhat larger mix shifts, but overall patterns still look limited and in line with recent pre‚ÄëAI trends.

- Why this might be: Large-scale workplace tech shifts typically unfold over decades; diffusion, reorganization, and workflow redesign take time.

- Caveats: The metric captures change, not cause; early shifts started before genAI; results aren‚Äôt predictive; better, more granular data are needed. The team plans monthly updates to track evolving impacts.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around whether AI's impact on jobs mirrors historical technological disruptions, particularly the Industrial Revolution, and debates the current evidence of AI-driven labor market changes.

1. **Skepticism About Immediate AI Impact**:  
   - Participants note that while companies hype AI to justify layoffs and push productivity, real-world AI adoption remains in early stages, with limited movement beyond prototypes. Changes may unfold over decades, requiring workflow redesign and organizational shifts.

2. **Historical Parallels**:  
   - Comparisons to the Industrial Revolution highlight that technological advances initially worsened labor conditions (e.g., child labor, dangerous factories) but eventually increased productivity and labor participation. However, these gains often required labor movements to address exploitation.  
   - The Luddite analogy is debated: while 19th-century textile workers resisted mechanization that devalued their skills, modern AI resistance is seen as distinct due to differing economic contexts and ethical concerns (e.g., fast fashion‚Äôs environmental and labor costs).

3. **Labor Conditions and Transitions**:  
   - The shift from agrarian economies to factories involved harsh conditions, but displaced workers had few alternatives. Similarly, AI‚Äôs disruption might force transitions, but outcomes depend on societal responses (e.g., regulations, worker protections).  
   - Some argue that productivity gains historically benefited capital owners first, with labor improvements lagging until collective action (unions, laws) intervened.

4. **Economic Models and Time Lags**:  
   - Participants reference studies showing that technological adoption‚Äôs full effects take decades. For AI, measurable job impacts may not emerge until 2025‚Äì2030, aligning with historical patterns of slow diffusion.  
   - The "urban penalty" (lower life expectancy in cities pre-20th century) is noted as a cautionary example of how initial disruptions can have hidden costs.

5. **Ethical and Global Considerations**:  
   - Modern parallels include outsourcing and exploitative practices in developing nations, raising questions about whether AI could exacerbate inequality without systemic safeguards.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores cautious optimism tempered by historical lessons‚ÄîAI‚Äôs potential for productivity gains is acknowledged, but participants stress the need for proactive policies and labor advocacy to mitigate adverse effects, mirroring past reforms.

### JetBrains will start training AI on your code on non-commercial license

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2025/09/30/detailed-data-sharing-for-better-ai/) | 77 points | by [Ianvdl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ianvdl) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45440117)

JetBrains asks devs to share real IDE data to train better AI, makes non‚Äëcommercial users opt-in by default

JetBrains says today‚Äôs LLMs are trained on public code that doesn‚Äôt reflect complex, real-world workflows, so their AI stumbles on professional use cases. To fix that, it‚Äôs launching an expanded data-sharing program to feed models with actual IDE activity.

What‚Äôs changing
- Companies: Admins can enable company-wide data sharing. JetBrains is offering a limited number of free All Products Pack subscriptions to early adopters.
- Individuals (non‚Äëcommercial licenses): Data sharing is ON by default; you can turn it off in settings.
- Individuals (commercial licenses, trials, free community, EAP): No change; you can opt in via settings (subject to admin policy).

What data they want
- Two layers:
  - Existing anonymous telemetry (feature usage, time spent, clicks).
  - New, detailed code-related data: edit history, terminal usage, interactions with AI features, including code snippets, prompts, and AI responses.

Why JetBrains says it matters
- Train models on real workflows to reduce hallucinations and logic gaps.
- Smarter code completion and explanations; fewer false positives.
- Better security posture: detect and filter unsafe code.
- Lower cost for high-volume, low-intelligence tasks vs. using a general foundation model alone.

Privacy stance
- Data sharing is optional; admins control it for orgs.
- Claims of EU data protection compliance, restricted access, and no sensitive/personal information shared.
- More details available in their data collection and protection docs.

Extras
- JetBrains cites promising internal results using real data.
- Its code-completion LLM, Mellum, is open source on Hugging Face and Amazon Bedrock.

Why it‚Äôll spark debate on HN
- Default-on for non‚Äëcommercial users and collection of code/terminal history will raise IP and privacy concerns.
- The value proposition‚ÄîAI that truly understands professional workflows‚Äîmay appeal to teams frustrated by generic LLM behavior.

The Hacker News discussion about JetBrains' opt-in-by-default data-sharing program highlights polarized views, with key themes including:

### **Privacy and Trust Concerns**
- **Opt-in-by-default for non-commercial users** sparks backlash, seen as exploitative ("paying with data instead of money"). Critics argue this undermines trust, especially for hobbyists or open-source contributors.
- **Data collection scope** (code snippets, terminal history, AI interactions) raises IP and privacy fears. Users question whether JetBrains has legal rights to use code from open-source projects for AI training.
- **Skepticism about transparency**: Some doubt JetBrains‚Äô claims of EU compliance and anonymization, citing past grievances like UI changes forced without consent.

### **Defense of JetBrains‚Äô Value**
- **Productivity advocates** praise JetBrains IDEs (e.g., IntelliJ, Rider) for stability, deep language support, and workflow efficiency compared to competitors like VS Code or Eclipse.
- **Business rationale**: Supporters argue the move aligns with improving AI tools for professional workflows, and opt-out options exist for those concerned.

### **Criticism of Recent Trends**
- **UI redesigns** are divisive: Some appreciate reclaiming screen space, while others label them "unnecessary churn" disrupting muscle memory.
- **Erosion of goodwill**: Long-time customers feel alienated by perceived profit-driven shifts, citing forced updates and opaque policies. Some threaten to cancel subscriptions.

### **Alternatives and Workarounds**
- Users suggest switching to **VS Code**, **Neovim**, or **Eclipse** for greater control. Others highlight challenges (e.g., C# development in Neovim lacking Razor Pages support).
- Technical workarounds: Blocking JetBrains telemetry via MDM tools or disabling data sharing immediately post-install.

### **Ethical and Licensing Debates**
- Questions about **open-source compliance**: Can JetBrains legally train models on code from projects with restrictive licenses (e.g., GPL)?
- **Opt-out friction**: Concerns that non-technical users might unknowingly contribute data, despite settings to disable sharing.

### **Overall Sentiment**
- **Mixed reactions**: While some see potential in AI trained on real workflows, distrust dominates. Critics view this as a slippery slope toward data exploitation, while supporters emphasize pragmatic trade-offs for better tools. The debate reflects broader tensions between innovation, user autonomy, and corporate control in AI development.
