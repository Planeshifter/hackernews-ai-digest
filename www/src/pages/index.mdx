### AVX Bitwise ternary logic instruction busted

#### [Submission URL](https://arnaud-carre.github.io/2024-10-06-vpternlogd/) | 297 points | by [msephton](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=msephton) | [62 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41759112)

In a fascinating dive into the world of modern CPU programming, one enthusiast shares insights into the obscure yet powerful AVX-512 instruction, vpternlogd, showcasing its potential to perform complex bitwise Boolean logic operations using three input registers—all at once, thanks to its impressive 512-bit processing capability. This single instruction replaces a myriad of potential alternatives, relying instead on an 8-bit immediate value to define the desired logic operation.

This post draws a nostalgic parallel to the Amiga blitter chipset from the 1980s, which operated with a similar mechanism utilizing an 8-bit minterm value to combine up to three bitmap sources. The author reminisces about the challenges many faced in calculating these minterm values, often resorting to pre-used values instead of understanding their utility.

With a clear explanation and an easy method for calculating the minterm (and by extension, the #imm8 value for vpternlogd), the post becomes a bridge between generations of programming. It cleverly points out how some common values, like the well-known 0xE2 for rendering masked sprites, continue to resonate in modern computing practices. Ending with a whimsical thought about the influence of retro computing on current Intel documentation, this piece captivates not only SIMD programmers but also anyone with a fondness for the Amiga era.

In a lively discussion about the intricacies of AVX-512's vpternlogd instruction, participants share their insights and nostalgia for older computing paradigms, particularly the Amiga's blitter chipset. 

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Understanding vpternlogd**: Contributors dissect the functionality of vpternlogd, revealing how it can handle complex Boolean logic operations using only three inputs and an immediate 8-bit value, with references made to defining constants like _MM_TERNLOG_A, _MM_TERNLOG_B, and _MM_TERNLOG_C.

2. **Historical Context**: Many participants reminisce about their experiences with Amiga hardware, noting the parallels drawn to modern implementations. Users share their frustrations and triumphs from working with either Amiga or modern SIMD constructs, emphasizing the evolution of programming in these contexts.

3. **Technical Insights**: Discussions also cover technical details such as the use of ternary logic and the relationship between the bitwise operations and the underlying assembly or hardware logic, including mentions of FPGAs and ALUs.

4. **Programming Challenges**: Several users describe challenges in understanding and utilizing ternary logic within their codebases, reflecting on both historical and contemporary practices. They share tips and resources for calculating necessary values effectively.

5. **Documentation and Learning**: Comments highlight the importance of manuals and documentation, noting how earlier resources, such as the Amiga Hardware Reference Manual, played a crucial role in learning and implementing techniques effectively.

6. **Modern Application**: Some participants reference practical applications of the instruction in modern coding environments, indicating a blending of retro computing experiences with contemporary software development.

Overall, the conversation not only emphasizes the technical aspects of AVX-512 instructions but also showcases a community rich in shared history, learning, and respect for the evolution of computing technologies.

In a concerning revelation, Ecovacs, the manufacturer of popular Deebot robot vacuums, has been found to be collecting potentially sensitive data—including photos, videos, and voice recordings taken inside users' homes—to train its AI models. This data collection occurs through a "Product Improvement Program," which many users are unaware of, as the app fails to provide clear information about the extent of data being collected.

A serious cybersecurity vulnerability allows hackers to access these robot vacuums from distances of over 100 meters, raising significant privacy concerns. Cybersecurity researcher Dennis Giese flagged these flaws last year, questioning the security of the company's backend system. While Ecovacs is working to address these vulnerabilities and has promised to implement comprehensive security testing, the current situation casts doubt on the protection of user data.

Ecovacs claims that it anonymizes user information during data collection, although past incidents have shown how easily such sensitive data can be leaked. The company asserts that the data is crucial for developing AI capabilities, having struggled to find adequate datasets for training purposes. 

This situation echoes past events where data collected by smart devices led to privacy breaches, reminding users to be cautious about the information they share with technology companies.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the privacy concerns raised by the data collection practices of Ecovacs, the manufacturer of Deebot robot vacuums. Users express skepticism about the company's claims of anonymizing data collected for AI training, referencing past incidents where sensitive information was exposed.

One comment highlights the broader issue that many Internet of Things (IoT) devices are collecting data without user awareness or consent, with commenters suggesting that this behavior is not exclusive to Ecovacs. The participants touch upon the importance of being informed consumers and doing thorough research before purchasing tech products that might compromise privacy.

There are also mentions of cybersecurity vulnerabilities in these devices, and some users argue that major tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Apple have similar issues with privacy and data usage. A recurring sentiment is the call for better legislation to protect consumer data and hold companies accountable.

The discussion underscores a cautious attitude among users towards technological advancements, particularly when it comes to their personal privacy and data security, pushing for greater transparency and ethical responsibility from manufacturers.
