This ongoing advancement in AI-powered protein science has inspired new algorithms, biotech companies, and innovative ways of conducting scientific research, demonstrating the profound impact of artificial intelligence in shaping the future of molecular biology.

The discussion revolves around the article discussing the advances made in protein folding using artificial intelligence, particularly with AlphaFold2 and its successor AlphaFold3. Some users express skepticism about the claims made in the article, questioning the complexity of the protein folding problem and the effectiveness of machine learning tools like AlphaFold. Others delve into the technical aspects of protein folding, addressing concepts like global minimum energy configurations, stability of proteins, and the role of optimization in solving complex problems. References to mathematical progressions and analogies are made to elucidate certain points. Overall, there is a mix of opinions on the implications and future potential of AI in protein science, ranging from excitement about its transformative capabilities to cautious skepticism about its limitations.

In the latest masterpiece from Greg Egan, "Schild’s Ladder," we are transported into a universe where Cass is on the brink of a groundbreaking discovery. At Mimosa Station, she embarks on an experiment involving quantum graphs that could revolutionize physics as we know it. However, the consequences of her success lead to the emergence of a destabilizing novo-vacuum that threatens entire systems across space.

Caught between Preservationists seeking to undo the damage and the adventurous Yielders embracing the challenge of survival beyond the border, tensions rise as allegiances are tested. As Cass and her allies navigate through these two vastly different universes, the fate of civilizations hangs in the balance.

With a blend of scientific intricacies and gripping narrative, "Schild’s Ladder" takes readers on a journey through parallel worlds where the quest for knowledge collides with the struggle for survival. Dive into this riveting tale that challenges the boundaries of possibility and the essence of existence.

### 110 new languages are coming to Google Translate

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.google/products/translate/google-translate-new-languages-2024/) | 54 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40808584)

Google Translate is breaking language barriers yet again by adding 110 new languages, including Cantonese, NKo, and Tamazight. This expansion, made possible using AI, aims to help over half a billion people worldwide. From Afar in Africa to Manx in the Isle of Man, these new languages represent a diverse array of cultures and communities. Through initiatives like the 1,000 Languages Initiative and the use of PaLM 2 large language model, Google Translate continues to grow and connect people across the globe. Whether translating Afar from Djibouti or Tok Pisin from Papua New Guinea, the world is now more accessible through Google Translate's latest update.

1. **tkglly** pointed out that the accuracy of Google Translate's translations is not as great when compared to translations done by Large Language Models like ChatGPT or Claude. They explained that sensitive contextual prompts are required for accurate translations, and even when explicitly prompted, Google Translate tends to take a non-size-fits-all approach to text translation. For example, they provided an illustration using Japanese words to describe older and younger siblings, highlighting differences in translation by different models.

2. **southernplaces7** mentioned the importance of Google working to improve the quality of translations in existing languages, particularly major languages like English and Spanish. They noted that improving the quality of Google Translate could uncover myriad errors. **pfnnkchn** questioned whether complaining about NASA's funding would solve poverty on Earth.

3. **Yawrehto** provided a link to a full list of the newly added languages by Google Translate, mentioning the inclusion of Ladino and discussing the challenges in learning languages like this hybrid of Spanish and Hebrew. **gmby** and **ratg13** further elaborated on the difficulties and the historical context of the Ladino language.

4. **PoignardAzur** highlighted the Celtic language of Manx spoken in the Isle of Man, discussing its extinction and recent revival movement. **KptMarchewa** expressed hope that the quality of translations would improve with models like ChatGPT and possibly Gemini.

5. **anon1094** appreciated the broad range of languages supported by Google Translate, emphasizing the importance of preserving and promoting minority languages. **mncdr** added that language diversity enriches interactions and relationships, and the extinction of languages can accelerate due to various factors including climate change.

6. **Flimm** expressed delight at the addition of expected languages on Google Translate. **dbbk** discussed the extensive language support by DeepL and comparisons to Google Translate in supporting different languages like Spanish. **snhntr** highlighted the importance of preserving minority languages like Manx and the significance of their implementation in educational systems.

7. **trcrtps** and **dbgnk** elaborated on the challenges of translating Spanish into English and the nuances in regional language variants. **nxrbl** cautioned against solely relying on machine translations and recommended using native speakers for better translation quality.

8. **jinpa_zangpo** expressed disappointment at the unavailability of Tibetan on Google Translate and questioned the decision behind not including certain languages. **jnr** shared a link to the languages available on Google Translate and clarified that Tibetan was among the released languages.

In conclusion, the discussion highlighted various perspectives on the language expansion of Google Translate, the challenges in translation accuracy, the importance of preserving minority languages, and the impact of language diversity on global interactions.
