### Discord starts down the dangerous road of ads this week

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/discord-starts-down-the-dangerous-road-of-ads-this-week/) | 33 points | by [CharlesW](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=CharlesW) | [15 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39899765)

Discord, the popular communication platform for gamers, is breaking its tradition of being ad-free and is now allowing video game makers to advertise to its users through Sponsored Quests. These ads offer in-game rewards to PC gamers for getting their friends to watch them play via Discord. While this marks a shift in Discord's business model, the ads are designed to be less intrusive compared to traditional social media ads, as users can opt out of personalized promotions. The company aims to help game developers reach more gamers through this form of marketing. 

The decision to implement ads is a departure from Discord's previous stance against advertising, which was seen as a key feature setting it apart from other social media platforms. Despite the introduction of ads, Discord assures users that they have the option to control the ads they see and that their data privacy is respected. However, the long-term implications of this move remain uncertain. 

Apart from Sponsored Quests, Discord is also exploring other revenue streams like selling sponsored profile effects and avatar decorations. The platform's growing revenue, user base exceeding 200 million monthly active users, and potential plans to go public indicate its significant market presence. While the introduction of ads may not significantly disrupt users who are uninterested, Discord must carefully balance its monetization efforts to ensure they do not detract from the core user experience that has made it popular among gamers.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.righto.com/2024/03/idt-gate-array.html) | 138 points | by [codezero](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=codezero) | [29 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39876817)

In a captivating exploration of a military-grade chip from the 7400 series, a deep dive reveals a surprising layout. Integrated Device Technology's IDT 54FCT139ALB chip showcases a unique design with over 1500 transistors forming an orderly matrix, where less than 20% of these transistors are utilized in the circuits connected by delicate metal wires. The chip, a dual 1-of-4 decoder, features a grid of 1584 transistors arranged in nine rows forming a gate array, with each row housing pairs of NMOS and PMOS transistors working in harmony to execute CMOS logic circuits.

Detailed close-up images of the silicon die expose the wiring channels between the rows that connect the transistors into gates via metal layers, akin to standard-cell logic but with a fixed transistor grid resulting in unused transistors. The blog post delves into the construction of a NAND gate on the die, elucidating the intricate arrangement of transistors and metal wiring to implement the NAND function effectively. Similarly, the layout of a larger NOR gate, employing eight transistors, is dissected to demonstrate its enhanced output potential compared to the NAND gate.

This enlightening analysis not only sheds light on the intricate inner workings of this unconventional chip design but also underscores the ingenuity behind optimizing functionality within the constraints of the gate array structure. It showcases how even in the realm of microelectronics, inefficiency can sometimes pave the way for innovation and unique problem-solving approaches.
