### Finding near-duplicates with Jaccard similarity and MinHash

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/fuzzy-dedup/) | 226 points | by [brianyu8](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=brianyu8) | [33 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40872438)

In a recent blog post, the author delves into the topic of approximate deduplication using Jaccard similarity and the MinHash approximation technique. The post explores the concept of defining similarity between documents and the challenges of approximate deduplication at scale.

The Jaccard index, a measure widely used in text processing, compares sets by calculating the ratio of their overlap to the size of their union. The author explains how this index intuitively captures the similarity between sets based on their elements.

To scale up the process of finding approximate duplicates, the post discusses the use of locality-sensitive hashing techniques for Jaccard similarity. By creating MinHash signatures for documents, which are small, fixed-size representations of the original sets, similar documents can be grouped efficiently.

By employing random sampling techniques and permutations, MinHash signatures offer a way to estimate Jaccard similarity between documents without examining the entire sets. This approach provides a practical method for identifying approximate duplicates within a large collection of documents.

The paper "Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion" introduces a novel training paradigm that combines the strengths of full-sequence diffusion models and next-token prediction models. By training a diffusion model to denoise tokens with varying noise levels, this approach, called Diffusion Forcing, allows for flexible and compositional generation while offering sequence-level guidance.

Diffusion Forcing can stabilize auto-regressive rollout, guide over long horizons, and support planning with causal uncertainty by utilizing different noise levels across a sequence during sampling. The method showcases stable and consistent video prediction results in datasets like DMLab and Minecraft, outperforming traditional teacher forcing and causal full-sequence diffusion models.

Moreover, Diffusion Forcing enables the generation of long videos beyond the training horizon without the need for a sliding window approach, demonstrating its stabilization effect. It also extends to diffusion planning, offering a decision-making framework with causal relationships and the ability to model long-horizon tasks like real robot arm manipulations.

Overall, Diffusion Forcing presents a versatile approach that optimizes a variational lower bound on token likelihoods, leading to marked performance gains in decision-making, planning tasks, and video prediction applications.

#### [Submission URL](https://cprimozic.net/blog/trying-out-kans/) | 140 points | by [Ameo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Ameo) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40855028)

The recent buzz surrounding Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) has piqued the interest of many in the machine learning community. These networks claim to offer enhanced accuracy and faster training compared to traditional neural networks, sparking curiosity and prompting experiments among enthusiasts. One such individual who delved into this exploration is cprimozic, who detailed their journey of implementing KANs from scratch and testing them on various tasks.

The crux of the matter lies in how KANs diverge from conventional neural networks by concentrating on learning activation functions rather than static connections between neurons. By utilizing B-Splines as the activation functions, KANs revolutionize the typical neural network structure. B-Splines are versatile mathematical constructs composed of piecewise polynomials that seamlessly stitch together, offering a continuous and customizable activation function for the network.

cprimozic's experimentation with KANs revealed both promising and challenging aspects. While the networks showcased competency in replicating simple 1D functions with relative ease, scaling up to handle more complex tasks presented hurdles. Despite significant tuning efforts and adjustments, achieving satisfactory performance on image parameterization tasks remained elusive for cprimozic.

Upon inspecting the PyKAN library's implementation of KANs, cprimozic uncovered a treasure trove of techniques and enhancements that bolstered the network's capabilities. From incorporating learnable bias vectors to fine-tuning optimization strategies, PyKAN's bag of tricks offered valuable insights into optimizing KAN performance.

In conclusion, while KANs demonstrate potential benefits over traditional neural networks in specific use cases, they come with a steep learning curve and demand meticulous fine-tuning. cprimozic's journey encapsulates the intricate nature of experimenting with cutting-edge technologies in the field of machine learning, shedding light on the nuanced interplay between theory and practical implementation.
