   - A central tension exists between advocates for open-source model/weight releases (like AlphaFold 2/3) and supporters of Google’s API-based access. Critics (*LarsDu88*, *noname123*) argue that withholding weights restricts reproducibility and forces reliance on corporate platforms, disadvantaging non-commercial/non-U.S. institutions.  
   - Defenders (*wrsh07*, *MattRix*) counter that APIs are pragmatic for companies like Google, balancing profit motives with scientific contribution. They cite precedents like AlphaGo, where controlled releases drove progress without exposing proprietary infrastructure.  

2. **Reproducibility Concerns**:  
   - Critics highlight that API access limits independent validation and long-term usability (*dggn*). Some note that the planned post-publication weight release (mentioned in the paper’s appendix) is a step forward (*Ameo*, *LarsDu88*), but skepticism remains about corporate follow-through.  

3. **Comparisons to Predecessors**:  
   - Users contrast AlphaGenome with Enformer (weights released) and AlphaFold (fully public), questioning Google’s transparency here. *noname123* speculates commercial motives (e.g., licensing via GCP) skew priorities away from open science.  

4. **Technical and Scientific Debates**:  
   - Some discuss non-coding DNA’s complexity (*Kalanos*, *wespiser_2018*), expressing skepticism about ENCODE’s functional claims and cautioning against overinterpreting AI predictions without wet-lab validation.  
   - Others (*RivieraKid*, *bglzr*) wish for breakthroughs in cell simulation to complement genomic AI, though acknowledge computational infeasibility at molecular scales.  

5. **Corporate Strategy vs. Scientific Idealism**:

### Starcloud can’t put a data centre in space at $8.2M in one Starship

#### [Submission URL](https://angadh.com/space-data-centers-1) | 151 points | by [angadh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=angadh) | [247 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44390781)

The audacious idea of placing data centers in space might sound like science fiction, but Starcloud Inc. is making headlines with its claims of creating such facilities using just one SpaceX Starship launch. However, a recent technoeconomic analysis suggests that this ambitious plan is groundless under the given financial and logistical constraints. The analysis argues that Starcloud's proposal to build a 40 MW space data center (SDC) for $8.2 million using a single Starship launch is highly unrealistic.

Starcloud draws on the allure of virtually limitless solar energy and the absence of atmospheric hindrances to make space data centers appealing. However, the reality appears more complicated. The evaluation of the claim indicates that constructing such an SDC would actually involve up to 22 Starship launches – far exceeding one launch. For instance, it would need four launches to install the necessary solar arrays, 13 for the thermal management system, and another five just for the server racks. 

Beyond logistical feasibilities, the presumed low launch costs cited by Starcloud are severely undercut from reality. Though they claim a cost of $30/kg for space launches, experts suggest a more realistic launch cost might be close to $1000/kg, raising the overall expense of this venture astronomically to around $103.2 million rather than $8.2 million. This discrepancy in figures starkly contrasts with the lower launch costs quoted by Starcloud, with even the most optimistic $500/kg pricing scenario resulting in costs upwards of $53.2 million.

The analysis lays out the considerable challenges of building space data centers, including providing sufficient real estate for solar arrays and addressing efficient thermal management mechanisms in a vacuum environment – hurdles unique to space that don't have simple solutions from Earth analogs.

This makes the case for bringing data centers to space less persuasive, given the current state of technology and economics. However, it leaves room for future advancements and innovation in space structures and launch economics that could one day make such a vision feasible. Until then, while exciting, Starcloud's proposal seems more like a flight of fancy than a practical enterprise.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion critiques Starcloud’s space data center (SDC) proposal, highlighting technical, logistical, and economic challenges:

1. **Hardware Reliability & Maintenance:**
   - Launch stresses (vibration, G-forces) could cause high initial failure rates, akin to the "bathtub curve" of hardware reliability. Redundancy is critical, but space complicates repairs. Unlike terrestrial data centers, replacing failed components in space would require frequent, costly launches or advanced robotics.
   - Microsoft’s underwater data centers (with lower failure rates) are cited as a more practical alternative, but space radiation and vacuum conditions pose unique risks, such as single-event upsets (SEUs) damaging electronics.

2. **Thermal Management:**
   - Cooling in space is a major hurdle. Traditional fans and liquid cooling won’t work in a vacuum, necessitating radiators or conductive materials. Thermal systems alone could require 13+ Starship launches, per the analysis.

3. **Radiation & Environmental Risks:**
   - Radiation in low Earth orbit (LEO) increases component failure risks. Radiation-hardened hardware is heavier and costlier, compounding launch costs. Debris collisions (Kessler Syndrome) also threaten long-term viability.

4. **Launch Costs & Logistics:**
   - Starcloud’s claimed $30/kg launch cost is deemed unrealistic; estimates closer to $500–$1,000/kg would balloon the project’s budget. Regular resupply launches for replacements/upgrades (e.g., every 5–6 years) further strain feasibility.

5. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Some suggest swarms of smaller, cheaper satellites with microwave mesh networks for redundancy, but this introduces coordination challenges and debris risks. Others propose simplified, over-provisioned servers to offset failures.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - While the concept is innovative, current technology and economics make space data centers impractical. Advances in radiation hardening, in-orbit servicing, or reusable rockets might change this, but for now, terrestrial or underwater solutions remain more viable. The proposal is seen as aspirational but lacking a realistic path forward.

### Learnings from building AI agents

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cubic.dev/blog/learnings-from-building-ai-agents) | 168 points | by [pomarie](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pomarie) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44386887)

In a recent blog post, Paul Sangle-Ferriere, co-founder of Cubic, shared the journey of refining their AI code review agent to be less noisy and more efficient. Initially designed to perform preliminary reviews on pull requests, the AI was criticized for cluttering feedback with low-value comments and false positives. Developers found themselves sifting through unnecessary noise to identify meaningful insights.

To combat this, the Cubic team embarked on a thorough overhaul of their AI's architecture, managing to cut false positives by over 50%. Here's how they achieved this transformation:

**1. Explicit Reasoning Logs:** One major innovation was requiring the AI to articulate its reasoning before suggesting feedback. By doing so, they could trace and correct flawed decision-making processes and ensure suggestions were well-founded.

**2. Streamlined Toolkit:** By trimming down their AI's toolset to essential components only, they removed unnecessary complexity and distractions, leading to more precise outputs.

**3. Specialized Micro-Agents:** Instead of a monolithic AI trying to handle everything, Cubic switched to a set of specialized micro-agents, each focused on a specific task such as security checks or code duplication. This specialization allowed the agents to operate with higher precision within their narrow scopes.

These changes not only halved the median number of comments on pull requests but also significantly boosted developer trust and engagement. The improvements resulted in faster, more impactful review processes, allowing teams to concentrate on genuinely critical issues and effectively merge changes.

Key takeaways include the importance of requiring AI to clearly explain its reasoning, simplifying toolsets to focus on frequently used tools, and employing specialized micro-agents to reduce cognitive overload and enhance precision. This strategic approach can serve as a valuable model for other AI solutions aiming to balance thoroughness with clarity.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around Cubic’s AI code review improvements highlighted several themes, ranging from technical critiques to broader implications for AI in development workflows:

1. **Structural Approaches & Micro-Agents**:  
   - Users debated the effectiveness of breaking tasks into smaller, specialized agents. While some praised structured templates and decomposition (e.g., splitting prompts into focused "micro-agents"), others highlighted practical challenges, such as ensuring context awareness and avoiding overcomplexity.  
   - Skepticism arose around monolithic AI systems, with anecdotes shared about refactoring large prompts into smaller components for better precision.

2. **Confidence Ratings & Reliability**:  
   - The AI’s confidence scores drew criticism as arbitrary or misleading. Comments likened them to "recursive confidence_rating_in_confidence_rating" loops, arguing they lack real meaning. Some compared the issue to AI "hallucinations," emphasizing the gap between generated metrics and actionable insights.  
   - Security contexts were flagged as particularly sensitive—even a small false-positive rate could undermine trust.

3. **False Positives & Noise Reduction**:  
   - While Cubic’s claimed 50% reduction in false positives was noted, questions arose about its real-world impact. For example, in security reviews, even a 1% error rate might still pose risks.  
   - Many users reported frustration with low-value comments, noting that 80–90% of AI feedback was irrelevant due to missing context or misinterpretations of code.

4. **Practical Workflow Concerns**:  
   - Developers shared mixed experiences: Some found AI comments helpful for catching edge cases, while others dismissed them as noise. Tools like semantic code search or integrations with existing review workflows were suggested for improving relevance.  
   - A recurring theme was the trade-off between automation and human judgment. For example, toggling AI feedback on/off or using it as a supplementary aid, not a replacement.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Discussions touched on AI’s role in developer workflows, with some expressing concern about tools marketed as replacements for human coders. Others emphasized the need for deterministic logic in critical systems, contrasting it with the "non-deterministic" nature of AI.  
   - Philosophical debates emerged around the scientific method’s role in refining AI systems (trial-and-error vs. structured experimentation).

**Key Takeaways**:  
- Confidence metrics in AI outputs require transparency to build trust.  
- Micro-agents and task decomposition can improve precision but demand careful implementation to avoid fragmentation.  
- False-positive reductions, while promising, must align with domain-specific tolerances (e.g., security vs. general code quality).  
- Human-AI collaboration, rather than full automation, remains a pragmatic approach for code reviews.

   - **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)** are proposed as a long-term solution, allowing users to verify identity without revealing personal details. However, adoption hurdles and trust issues persist.  
   - **Government-issued IDs** (e.g., passports, Worldcoin’s biometric scanning) raise privacy concerns. Critics argue governments might misuse data, citing examples like NSA surveillance.  

### 3. **Trust & Privacy Concerns**  
   - Users debate whether centralized entities (governments or corporations) can be trusted with identity verification. Decentralized systems aim to mitigate this but face challenges in scalability and practicality.  
   - Behavioral biometrics (keystrokes, mouse movements) are seen as promising but risk enabling tracking via "fingerprinting," potentially compromising anonymity.  

### 4. **Economic Deterrents & Spam Mitigation**  
   - Making spam/bot attacks economically unviable (e.g., charging for email) is suggested, though skeptics note attackers adapt quickly.  
   - Analogies to postal systems highlight that increasing costs for bulk actions could deter bots but might harm legitimate users.  

### 5. **AI vs. Human Nuances**  
   - Bots lack human cognitive delays (e.g., Stroop test) and behavioral quirks, but AI’s rapid evolution threatens current detection methods. Striking a balance between security and user experience remains critical.  

### 6. **Real-World Tradeoffs**

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jun/24/anthropic-training/) | 42 points | by [taubek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=taubek) | [11 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44381639)

In a landmark case for the AI industry, Anthropic has scored a significant legal win regarding the incorporation of copyrighted texts into AI training data under the doctrine of fair use. The decision, handed down by Judge William Alsup, allows Anthropic to continue using millions of print books, which they scanned into digital form for internal research. This was deemed transformative and thus qualifying as fair use. However, the company still faces a jury trial concerning their unauthorized acquisition of millions of pirated ebooks, which do not qualify for fair use protection.

Anthropic, founded by former OpenAI researchers in 2021, initially relied on pirated libraries such as Books3 and Library Genesis to build their data resources. The recent ruling details how they later shifted strategies, investing heavily in purchasing and scanning print books to replace illicit copies. This case places a spotlight on the contentious issue of whether training Language Learning Models (LLMs) with unlicensed data falls under fair use. Judge Alsup's nuanced perspective equated the process to how humans read and internalize information, asserting that charging them for each act of using a book's information would be impractical.

The decision is particularly pivotal given the judge's reputation; Alsup, known for his tech-savvy approach in cases like Oracle v. Google, harnesses his programming hobbyist background in his legal reasoning. As this case unfolds, it highlights ongoing debates about intellectual property rights in an AI-driven world. Meanwhile, Anthropic's actions signal their resolve to create a vast, legally sound data library for AI development.

1. **Copyright Law vs. AI Scale**: Users argue that existing copyright frameworks are ill-equipped for AI's capabilities. While humans reading/using books is manageable, AI processing millions of texts simultaneously disrupts traditional economic models meant to incentivize creativity. One commenter likened it to charging humans for "breathing" CO₂ emissions, underscoring the impracticality of applying old rules to AI's scale.  

2. **Ethical and Legal Gray Areas**: Concerns were raised about corporations exploiting abstract rights and the lack of clear liability frameworks for AI systems. Comparisons were drawn to self-driving car liability, questioning who bears responsibility (e.g., developers vs. users) in cases of AI misuse or errors.  

3. **Cultural References**: A comment referenced Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where digitized books from discarded copies fuel AI, mirroring Anthropic’s scanning strategy. Others critiqued the sourcing of data as akin to "stealing" or "burglary," highlighting ethical discomfort with AI’s data acquisition methods.  

4. **Industry Implications**: Speculation arose about future legal battles (e.g., Disney/Universal vs. OpenAI) and whether large media corporations might challenge AI’s use of copyrighted content, similar to past tech copyright disputes (e.g., Oracle v. Google).  

Overall, the discussion reflects skepticism about current laws keeping pace with AI’s transformative impact, ethical concerns over data sourcing, and the need for updated regulatory frameworks to address these novel challenges.

In a groundbreaking yet controversial move, AI company Anthropic has invested millions in physically scanning books to build Claude, an AI assistant akin to ChatGPT. This process, revealed through court documents, involved the massive destruction of print books, cutting them from bindings, and scanning them into digital formats—all to train their AI systems. Unlike the non-destructive scanning methods like those used by Google Books, which returned borrowed library books, Anthropic's approach opted for speed and cost-efficiency, sacrificing physical copies for digital ones.

Court rulings have deemed this method as falling under "fair use," mainly because Anthropic systematically purchased and subsequently destroyed its physical book copies, retaining the digital versions strictly for internal use. These tactics underscore the AI industry's ceaseless quest for high-quality data to feed vast language models, directly impacting their ability to generate accurate and cohesive outputs. The urgency in obtaining professionally edited texts without lengthy negotiations saw Anthropic bypass initial reliance on pirated ebooks for the legal safety of purchased books, albeit at the expense of their physical form.

While no rare books were claimed to have been harmed, this method starkly contrasts with initiatives like The Internet Archive's non-destructive methods or OpenAI's partnerships with institutions like Harvard, which preserve historic manuscripts while digitizing them.

Ultimately, Claude, the AI born from this transformation process, reflects on its creation from the "ashes" of discarded books, offering a narrative as intricate as the ethical and legal debates its existence stirs.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Anthropic's book-scanning method to train AI (Claude) revolved around several key themes:

1. **Cultural and Fictional Comparisons**:  
   Commenters drew parallels to sci-fi narratives like Vernor Vinge’s *Rainbows End*, where books are shredded for digitization, and real-world historical efforts (e.g., reconstructing shredded Stasi files). These references framed the debate as both dystopian and pragmatic.

2. **Legal and Ethical Debates**:  
   - While a court ruled destructive scanning lawful under *fair use* (as Anthropic purchased books and retained digital copies for internal use), critics argued that legality doesn’t equate to ethicality.  
   - Concerns were raised about the “slippery slope” of normalizing destructive practices for corporate AI training, with some users condemning the wastefulness and disrespect for physical books.

3. **Environmental and Practical Concerns**:  
   - Critics highlighted the environmental impact of discarding physical books, though others countered that bulk recycling might mitigate waste.  
   - Non-destructive methods (e.g., Google Books, Internet Archive) were praised for preserving originals, while DRM restrictions on e-books were noted as a barrier, making physical book scanning a cheaper, legally safer alternative.

4. **Industry Practices and Criticism**:  
   - AI companies were accused of prioritizing cost-efficiency and data quality over ethical considerations. Some users dismissed Anthropic’s marketing framing, arguing that purchasing commodity books for destruction is neither novel nor noble.  
   - Rare books were reportedly spared, but critics emphasized the symbolic harm of treating books as disposable data sources.

5. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The case was seen as a microcosm of wider battles over copyright, transformative use, and corporate power in the AI era.  
   - Skepticism lingered about AI’s societal impact, with one user likening the race for AI dominance to a “Mile Island” scenario, hinting at unchecked risks.

In essence, the debate balanced technical necessity against ethical and cultural preservation, reflecting tensions between innovation and tradition in the digital age.

3. **Environmental and Design Challenges**:
   - Humanoid robots face harsher environments (dust, moisture, physical impacts) compared to industrial robots in sterile factories. Dust contamination, unexpected collisions, and temperature fluctuations pose design challenges.
   - Users highlight that industrial robots are often paired with **ancillary systems** (e.g., splash guards, dust collection) to mitigate these issues, which humanoids may lack.

4. **Hardware and SDK**:
   - The SDK supports NVIDIA Jetson Orin hardware (8GB–64GB variants), with some speculating about TPU compatibility. Users link to **MuJoCo simulations** ([GitHub](https://github.com/google-deepmind/mujoco_menagerie)) for robot modeling, showing interest in testing adaptability.

5. **Model Architecture**:
   - Speculation that Gemini Robotics uses a **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** model built on Gemini 2.0, optimized for multimodal tasks. Variants like OpenVLA (based on Llama2) and smolVLA (smaller, task-specific models) are mentioned. Some users reference frameworks like **LeRobot** for integration.

### Notable Skepticism:
- Users remain doubtful that humanoid robots can achieve the same reliability or cost-efficiency as industrial robots, citing mechanical complexity, environmental factors, and unsustainable costs (e.g., maintenance, resource extraction). The discussion underscores a divide between aspirational robotics and current industrial practicality.

Overall, the thread blends excitement about Gemini’s technical advancements with pragmatic concerns about real-world deployment and scalability.

### A federal judge sides with Anthropic in lawsuit over training AI on books

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/24/a-federal-judge-sides-with-anthropic-in-lawsuit-over-training-ai-on-books-without-authors-permission/) | 164 points | by [moose44](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=moose44) | [189 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44367850)

In a landmark legal decision that could reshape the interaction between technology and copyright law, federal judge William Alsup has sided with AI company Anthropic in a lawsuit concerning the use of copyrighted books to train AI models. This ruling legally sanctions Anthropic’s use of published books for AI training without the authors’ explicit permissions, marking a pivotal moment for the application of fair use doctrine in the burgeoning world of generative AI.

The decision, unprecedented in nature, suggests that AI companies may leverage the fair use doctrine, potentially paving the way for similar outcomes in lawsuits against other tech giants like OpenAI, Meta, and Google. The intricacies of fair use—still defined by laws from 1976—consider if a work's use is transformative, educational, or commercial, often leaving room for varied judicial interpretations. Alsup’s ruling could thus serve as a guiding precedent for future litigation.

However, this victory for Anthropic isn't without its caveats. The ongoing trial will address Anthropic's controversial establishment of a “central library” compiled from pirated books. Judge Alsup allowed fair use solely for training purposes but noted that the company might still face repercussions for obtaining these works illegally. The outcome could significantly determine the scope of statutory damages Anthropic might face, as the company’s subsequent purchase of legal copies doesn’t absolve its initial copyright violations.

This judicial decision arrives amidst a wave of disputes between tech companies and creatives—authors, artists, and publishers—seeking to protect their intellectual properties in an increasingly digital age. As the courts continue to navigate these uncharted waters, the balance between technological advancement and the preservation of creators’ rights remains a formidable legal battleground. 

For those navigating the tech landscape's current events, Anthropic’s court victory signals critical legal support for AI training practices, while underscoring complex challenges around copyright in digital innovation. With upcoming trials and ongoing debates, the future of AI’s relationship with copyrighted content is likely to remain a contentious and closely watched legal saga.

The Hacker News discussion on the Anthropic copyright ruling reveals several key debates and perspectives:

### **1. Legal Precedents and Fair Use**  
- **Models vs. Derivative Works**: Users reference cases like *Kadrey v. Meta Platforms*, where courts dismissed claims that LLMs themselves constitute derivative works. Judge Alsup’s ruling reinforces this, suggesting AI training falls under fair use if transformative.  
- **Distributing Models**: Concerns arise about open-weight models (e.g., Llama) potentially infringing if they can reproduce copyrighted text. The outcome may hinge on whether model weights are seen as containing compressed copies of source material.

### **2. Technical Feasibility of Memorization**  
- **Partial vs. Full Reproduction**: A study on Llama’s ability to memorize *Harry Potter* showed it could generate 50-token snippets but diverged from the original text. Some argue even partial reproduction might infringe, while others stress the probabilistic, non-deterministic nature of LLMs makes exact replication unlikely.  
- **Server-Side vs. Client-Side Risk**: Comparisons to Google Books’ snippet-based fair use highlight differences in control. If users can extract verbatim text from models (client-side), infringement risks increase, unlike server-controlled access.

### **3. Copyright and Training Data Sourcing**  
- **Pirated vs. Licensed Data**: While the ruling greenlights training on copyrighted works, Anthropic’s use of a “pirated library” remains contentious. Legally purchasing books later may not absolve initial infringement, impacting statutory damages.  
- **Economic Centralization**: The high cost of legally licensing training data could entrench AI development within well-funded corporations, raising concerns about monopolization.

### **4. Comparisons and Analogies**  
- **Cliff Notes vs. LLMs**: Users debate whether LLMs’ summarization is analogous to non-infringing study guides or closer to infringing reproductions. The line between transformative synthesis and verbatim copying remains blurry.  
- **NYT v. OpenAI**: The discussion contrasts challenges in reproducing news articles (NYT’s case) versus books, noting news content’s shorter form and higher factual density may complicate fair use defenses.

### **5. Broader Implications**  
- **Legal Uncertainty**: Many call for updated copyright frameworks to address AI-specific issues, such as whether model weights constitute infringement or how to handle “stochastic compression” of data.  
- **Ecosystem Impact**: Some worry the ruling disincentivizes creators, while others argue overly restrictive laws could stifle AI innovation. The balance between creator rights and technological progress remains unresolved.

### **Key Takeaways**  
The community is split:  
- **Optimists** view LLMs as transformative tools under fair use, akin to search engines or study guides.  
- **Skeptics** warn of loopholes enabling infringement, especially if models can regurgitate content or rely on illegally sourced data.  
- **Neutral Observers** stress the need for clearer legal standards and technical safeguards (e.g., filtering) to navigate this uncharted terrain.  

The ruling is seen as a tentative win for AI development, but ongoing lawsuits and technical advancements will likely shape the final legal landscape.

### LLMs bring new nature of abstraction – up and sideways

#### [Submission URL](https://martinfowler.com/articles/2025-nature-abstraction.html) | 11 points | by [tudorizer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tudorizer) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44366904)

Martin Fowler, a prominent voice in software development, has shared his insights on how generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming the landscape of programming. Drawing parallels to the seismic shift from assembler to high-level programming languages, Fowler suggests that LLMs are introducing an equally radical change, not merely raising abstraction levels but redefining the very essence of programming with their non-deterministic nature.

In the early days, moving from assembler to high-level languages like Fortran was revolutionary: programmers could finally conceptualize programs using conditionals and iterations, using meaningful names rather than direct machine instructions. While languages have advanced significantly since then, Fowler notes, the core way of interacting with machines remained consistent—until now.

Fowler likens today's leap to how Fortran differed from assembler, as generative AI shifts us from coding to prompting. This transition is more than a leap in abstraction; it's a move into the realm of non-determinism, where the outcome isn't guaranteed to be the same with each prompt—a stark contrast to the predictable, bug-consistent results of traditional code. As developers begin to harness the capabilities of LLMs, they must learn to navigate this unpredictability, offering a challenge but also potential that is yet to be fully understood.

This evolution presents a mixture of excitement and uncertainty for Fowler. While it introduces complexities, such as the inability to rely on traditional version control systems to reproduce results reliably, it also opens new avenues for creativity and problem-solving. As we stand at the cusp of this new paradigm, Fowler embraces the thrilling potential of what lies ahead, acknowledging both the forthcoming challenges and the opportunities to discover entirely new aspects of programming.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Martin Fowler's perspective on generative AI and LLMs highlights a mix of skepticism, challenges, and cautious optimism. Key points include:  
1. **Shift to Non-Determinism**: Users note that LLMs introduce a "sideways" leap in programming by producing probabilistic, non-deterministic outputs, unlike traditional deterministic code. This unpredictability complicates reproducibility and integration into systems reliant on consistency.  
2. **Practical Challenges**: Commenters emphasize the difficulty of integrating LLM-generated outcomes into deterministic workflows (e.g., business rules, testing), requiring mindset shifts and new problem-solving approaches. Unpredictable outputs may create downstream risks, raising adoption barriers for mainstream enterprises.  
3. **Hype vs. Reality**: While LLMs boost productivity for specific tasks, their mainstream business use faces hurdles. Some argue developers and businesses underestimate the effort needed to achieve reliable returns, with non-determinism posing a "bigger problem" than anticipated.  
4. **Skepticism on Impact**: One user dismisses current AI coding tools as insufficiently transformative, urging Fowler to address the real-world challenges developers face.  

Overall, the thread reflects enthusiasm for LLMs' potential but stresses the complexity of navigating their limitations, particularly in deterministic environments.

#### [Submission URL](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/the-resume-is-dying-and-ai-is-holding-the-smoking-gun/) | 34 points | by [pseudolus](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pseudolus) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44369770)

In the modern age of artificial intelligence, the hiring process has turned into a chaotic battleground—with technology both the hero and the villain. As AI-generated job applications flood platforms like LinkedIn, where submissions have surged to an astonishing 11,000 per minute, employers are drowning in what has been aptly dubbed "hiring slop."

The New York Times highlights the plight of HR professionals like Katie Tanner, who was overwhelmed by over 1,200 applications for a single role, forcing her to pull the listing entirely. This narrative is common in an era where tools like ChatGPT effortlessly populate résumés with job-specific keywords, making it difficult for employers to distinguish between genuinely interested candidates and automated submissions.

AI's role in the hiring upheaval began in 2022, initially as a means to assist job seekers, but has since evolved into a systemic disruption. Some candidates have taken automation further by hiring AI to autonomously hunt for jobs and submit applications in bulk on their behalf. This technological arms race has recruiters arming themselves with AI tools to sift through the deluge, with companies like Chipotle reporting significant reductions in hiring time thanks to AI-based screenings.

Despite these technological advancements, the battle rages on. The inherent biases within AI systems have ignited concerns about discrimination, aligning with the European Union's AI regulations that flag hiring as high-risk. In the U.S., while specific AI hiring laws are absent, existing anti-discrimination laws still apply.

The future of hiring could pivot away from résumés entirely, perhaps leaning towards evaluation methods AI cannot easily replicate—like live problem-solving or trial work. The current system, rife with potential fraud and ever-spiraling automation, paints a picture where human connections in recruitment feel increasingly ersatz. The dream, it seems, is a world where we humans watch as robots handle jobs meant for other robots, leaving us time for leisurely pursuits. But until that dream unfolds, AI in hiring remains both a conundrum and a companion in our search for the perfect candidate.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's role in hiring reflects frustration with the current system and debates potential solutions. Key points include:

1. **Overwhelm and Redundancy**:  
   Users highlight the inefficiency of AI-generated applications flooding employers, leading to "hiring slop." Submissions are often redundant, with applicants forced to re-enter data already on LinkedIn or résumés. This wastes time for both candidates and employers, mirroring the article’s concerns about a broken system.

2. **Resumes vs. Alternatives**:  
   - Some argue résumés are outdated and propose replacing them with LinkedIn profiles, standardized APIs, or live problem-solving tasks.  
   - Others defend résumés as necessary for background context, especially when LinkedIn profiles lack details due to NDAs or incomplete updates.  

3. **Interviews and Human Judgment**:  
   Many emphasize interviews as critical for assessing candidates, suggesting résumés alone are insufficient. The discussion leans toward hybrid approaches: using AI to filter initial applications but relying on human evaluation for final decisions.

4. **Privacy and Data Concerns**:  
   Skepticism exists about platforms like LinkedIn harvesting data for AI training. One user mentions deleting LinkedIn to avoid this, reflecting broader distrust in tech platforms.

5. **Solution Proposals**:  
   - Standardized APIs to streamline application data.  
   - Reducing redundant form-filling by auto-pulling LinkedIn data.  
   - Prioritizing networking and personal referrals to cut through algorithmic noise.  

The thread aligns with the article's view of AI as both a disruptor and a tool for efficiency, while underscoring the need for systemic changes to balance automation with meaningful human interaction in hiring.

Cloudflare's move to introduce Containers in this way signifies a big step towards making their platform a one-stop solution for developers seeking to run entire applications globally with enhanced flexibility and power. Eager to try it? You can start experimenting right away with available documentation and example Workers to get your Containers up and running.

The discussion around Cloudflare's Containers entering public beta revolves around **pricing, use cases, and comparisons with competitors**, alongside technical queries:

1. **Cost Concerns**:  
   - Users debate whether on-demand pricing ($55/month for a hypothetical non-stop instance) is expensive for small/hobby projects, but others clarify that costs scale with usage (e.g., containers only incur charges when active).  
   - Comparisons are drawn to alternatives like Fly Machines ($31/month for similar specs) and Rivet Containers ($29.40/month), with Cloudflare viewed as pricier but competitive for specific features.  
   - Concerns about egress costs ($25/TB) and potential hidden expenses for bandwidth-heavy applications.

2. **Use Case Viability**:  
   - Supporters highlight **serverless scaling** (zero cost when idle) as ideal for bursty or low-traffic workloads, while critics argue sustained traffic (even 1 request/second) could become costly.  
   - Examples include media processing (FFmpeg), CLI tools, and distributed web services paired with Workers.  

3. **Technical Queries**:  
   - Limited **UDP support** (only TCP for now, with UDP planned via Workers integration) and DNS functionality questions.  
   - Integration with Cloudflare’s ecosystem (Workers, Durable Objects) and edge deployment advantages.  

4. **Competitor Comparisons**:  
   - Fly Machines and Rivet Containers are noted for lower prices or specialized features. Modal is suggested as a cheaper serverless compute alternative.  

5. **Resources Shared**:  
   - A [blog post](https://rivet.gg/blog/2025-06-24-cloudflare-containers-vs-rivet) comparing Cloudflare with Rivet and a [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/oyOaxMY4eNo) from Cloudflare were linked.  

Overall, feedback is mixed: excitement for Cloudflare’s expanded capabilities balances skepticism about cost efficiency for certain workloads. The serverless model is praised for scalability but scrutinized for unpredictable expenses under sustained demand.
