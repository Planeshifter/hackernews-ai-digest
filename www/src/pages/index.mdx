### Translating blog posts with GPT-4, or: on hope and fear

#### [Submission URL](http://antirez.com/news/141) | 73 points | by [grep_it](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=grep_it) | [53 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38932428)

In his blog post titled "Translating blog posts with GPT-4, or: on hope and fear," Salvatore Sanfilippo, also known as antirez, shares his process of writing blog posts and his experiment with using GPT-4 to translate his posts from Italian to English. Sanfilippo explains that his typical process involves thinking about a topic for weeks or months before writing a blog post. Once he has enough ideas, he spends about 30 minutes writing the post without focusing too much on the form. This approach allows him to quickly share his thoughts while juggling other responsibilities. However, he admits that this often results in blog posts that are poorly written, with limited vocabulary and grammar errors.

To address this issue, Sanfilippo decided to try a new approach for his post about LLMs and programming. He wrote the post in Italian and used GPT-4 to translate it into English. Surprisingly, he found that the translated post was much better in quality than his usual English posts. He was able to hear his own voice in the translation, and tools that detect AI-generated text couldn't tell the difference.
While the process may seem synthetic and raise concerns about losing confidence in writing English, Sanfilippo is uncertain about how his blog will be written in the future. He appreciates that the translated post represents his true voice in his mother tongue and wonders if English writing is somewhat of a bluff. He ponders whether style is more about sentence construction or vocabulary selection and believes it's a combination of both.
Sanfilippo concludes with a mix of hope and fear for the possibilities of machine-assisted communication. He sees the potential for machines to talk as a positive development for humanity but also worries about the potential laziness that AI could cultivate, with people no longer willing to put in the effort of learning a new language.
In the comments section of the blog post, readers can engage in further discussions.

### An "AI Breakthrough" on Systematic Generalization in Language?

#### [Submission URL](https://aiguide.substack.com/p/an-ai-breakthrough-on-systematic) | 46 points | by [picometer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=picometer) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38916596)

In a recent paper, researchers Brenden Lake and Marco Baroni presented a neural network that demonstrates "human-like systematic generalization" in language understanding. This is significant because neural networks have traditionally struggled with this kind of generalization, where they can understand and produce related sentences if they can understand or produce a particular sentence. The researchers created a set of puzzles that tested this ability and found that their neural network performed on par with humans, including making similar errors. The media covered this as an "AI Breakthrough" and a method for helping AI "generalize like people do." However, there is still debate over the extent to which this achievement fulfills those enthusiastic characterizations.

The discussion on this submission focuses on the significance and limitations of the research paper. 
User "sgt101" finds the paper interesting and suggests that it makes some fascinating contributions to the field of AI, particularly in abstract reasoning. They also mention the importance of in-depth reviews of such papers.
User "shrmntnktp" provides three points to consider. Firstly, they refer to Betteridge's law of headlines, which suggests that the answer to any headline question is most likely "no." Secondly, they mention a study that involved 25 participants from Mechanical Turk, implying that the sample size is small and the results may not be directly comparable to human performance. Lastly, they express skepticism about the media coverage of this research, emphasizing the need for scrutiny and caution when interpreting results.
User "vrptr" engages with "shrmntnktp" and asks for clarification on their criticism. 
User "shrmntnktp" responds, agreeing that the sample size of 25 is small and may not adequately characterize human reasoning. They argue that this is a classic problem in psychology and AI research, where small sample sizes often lead to claims that do not hold up to scrutiny. They emphasize the need for a stronger foundation and extrapolation of the results.

A recent paper titled "Thousands of AI Authors on the Future of AI" presents the findings of the largest survey of its kind, involving 2,778 researchers who have published in top-tier artificial intelligence (AI) venues. The researchers were asked to give their predictions on the pace of AI progress and the potential impacts of advanced AI systems. The aggregate forecasts suggest that there is at least a 50% chance of AI systems achieving several significant milestones by 2028, including autonomously constructing a payment processing site from scratch, creating a song indistinguishable from a new song by a popular musician, and autonomously downloading and fine-tuning a large language model. The study also found that if science continues undisrupted, there is a 10% chance of unaided machines outperforming humans in every possible task by 2027 and a 50% chance by 2047. However, there is still substantial uncertainty among respondents about the long-term value of AI progress, with disagreement about the potential outcomes, including extremely bad outcomes such as human extinction. While most researchers expressed optimism about the positive outcomes of superhuman AI, many also acknowledged the need to prioritize research aimed at minimizing potential risks from AI systems. Overall, the study highlights the diverse perspectives and concerns within the AI research community about the future of AI and its implications for society.

The discussion on this submission involves various points of disagreement and clarification regarding the topic of AI and the simulation of the human brain. Some users express skepticism about the approach of simulating chemical processes and neural networks in the brain, arguing that it is not an accurate representation of its functioning. Others delve into the complexity of chemical processes in cells and the challenges of understanding and modeling them.
There is a debate about the capability of AI systems to simulate the human brain and achieve general intelligence. Some argue that current AI research has not shown the ability to fully represent the brain's neural network, while others suggest that estimates of the parameter counts in AI models imply that sufficient representation is possible.
The discussion also touches on the limitations of simulating neural networks and the computational resources required. Some users discuss the bandwidth and processing limitations of systems compared to the vast number of synapses and channels in the brain.
Additionally, there are arguments about the definition of general intelligence and whether humans possess it. Some users highlight the difference between humans and computers in terms of their ability to perform intellectual tasks, while others emphasize that humans do possess general intelligence.

Overall, the discussion reflects a range of views and opinions on the topic of AI and its potential to simulate the human brain and achieve general intelligence.
