Malicious hackers are using a clever tactic that starts with adding a link to the victim's calendar on Calendly, a popular scheduling application. The attackers pose as well-known cryptocurrency investors, scheduling video calls that lead to the installation of malware on macOS systems. One startup seeking investment for a blockchain platform fell victim to this scam, as detailed by KrebsOnSecurity.

The scam begins with an impersonator on Telegram, using the name and profile of a legitimate investor, to schedule a video call through Calendly. When the victim clicks the meeting link, a script is run quietly installing malware. In this case, the scam artists pretended to be from Signum Capital, a reputable investment firm based in Singapore. The victim, known as "Doug," eventually realized the ruse after encountering technical difficulties during the video call setup, prompting a suspicious response.

This incident sheds light on a sophisticated phishing campaign linked to North Korean state-sponsored hackers who use social engineering tactics. The malicious script, disguised as a legitimate meeting link, leads users to unwittingly download and execute malware, granting hackers control over the victim's computer. The attackers, associated with the group BlueNoroff, a subgroup of the notorious Lazarus hacking group, target various industries to steal funds and cryptocurrency.

While macOS systems are not immune to such threats, the incident emphasizes the need for vigilance and cybersecurity measures, especially as cybercriminals evolve their tactics to bypass existing defenses. It serves as a critical reminder for individuals and organizations in the cryptocurrency space to stay wary of social engineering attacks and prioritize security protocols to safeguard sensitive information.
