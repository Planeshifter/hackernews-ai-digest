#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08945) | 75 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37269376)

Researchers have proposed a new approach called IGNNet (Interpretable Graph Neural Network) that aims to make graph neural networks (GNNs) more interpretable when applied to tabular data. GNNs have become popular for handling tabular data due to their ability to capture feature interactions through representation learning. However, the models produced by GNNs are often considered black boxes, making it challenging to understand how the predictions are computed. IGNNet addresses this issue by constraining the learning algorithm to produce an interpretable model that shows the exact computation process from the original input features. The researchers conducted a large-scale empirical investigation and found that IGNNet performed on par with state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for tabular data, such as XGBoost, Random Forests, and TabNet. Furthermore, the explanations obtained from IGNNet were aligned with the true Shapley values of the features without incurring additional computational overhead. This approach holds promise for improving the interpretability of GNNs in real-world applications.

The discussion surrounding the submission on Hacker News includes various points of interest. One user, "PaulHoule," commented that significant regional articles related to the field of research don't handle tabular data and mentioned that there are other things that graph neural networks (GNNs) can't handle, similar to ChatGPT-like models.

### Show HN: PlotAI – Create Plots in Python and Matplotlib with LLM

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/mljar/plotai) | 50 points | by [pplonski86](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=pplonski86) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37260913)

PlotAI is a new Python library that makes it incredibly easy to create plots in Python using Matplotlib. The library harnesses the power of the LLM (Language Models for Plots) to generate the necessary Python code for creating plots based on user input. Here's how it works: users provide a DataFrame and a prompt, and PlotAI constructs a prompt for the LLM that includes the first five rows of the DataFrame and the user's prompt. The LLM then generates Python code as output, which is executed and the resulting plot is displayed. The PlotAI API is incredibly simple, with just one method called `make()`. Users can use this method in Python scripts and notebooks (such as Jupyter, Colab, and VS Code) to create plots. To get started with PlotAI, users need to install the PlotAI package (`pip install plotai`) and provide their OpenAI API key in the `.env` file. Once that's done, they can import PlotAI and start making plots using just a single line of code. While PlotAI is currently in an experimental form, there are plans to extend its compatibility to other LLM models in the future. However, it's important to note that PlotAI sends the first five rows of the DataFrame to the OpenAI ChatGPT model, so users should remove or encode any sensitive data before using it. Additionally, since PlotAI executes the Python code returned by the LLM, caution should be exercised, and it would be beneficial to have the option to review the response code before execution. The developers of PlotAI provide it "as is," without any warranty, and users are responsible for any risks associated with its use. It's also important to note that the use of OpenAI language models can be costly due to token usage, so users should monitor and manage their own token usage to avoid unexpected charges. Overall, PlotAI aims to make plot generation in Python more accessible and intuitive for users. With its simplicity and integration with LLM technology, creating visualizations has never been easier.

The discussion around the PlotAI submission on Hacker News covers a few different points:

1. A user suggests exploring Vega and Vega-Lite for visualization grammar and mentions the use of Vegavoyager and CompassQL for chart recommendations.
2. Another user mentions the potential benefits of using OpenAI's language models to generate synthetic data for graphing but raises concerns about the formatting and potential misuse.
3. A user comments on the potential usefulness of LLMs like the ones used by PlotAI and suggests the Code Llama tool as an alternative with the ability to generate appropriate chart types based on natural language metadata.
4. One user appreciates the simplicity of PlotAI's API and suggests an example of how to use it in Python scripts and notebooks.
5. There is a discussion about the capabilities of the LLM model in understanding and generating prompt-specific Python code and surprise at its ability to generalize from the first five rows of a DataFrame.
6. Another conversation arises about a potential major acquisition and ML projects, with one user seeking advice on the topic.
7. Lastly, there is a short exchange regarding string arguments and comments in code.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23837598/tesla-elon-musk-self-driving-false-promises-land-of-the-giants) | 32 points | by [ra7](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ra7) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37242435)

In the latest episode of Land of the Giants: The Tesla Shock Wave, The Verge explores the false promises of Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature. Back in 2016, Elon Musk announced that all Tesla vehicles would come equipped with the hardware necessary for full self-driving capabilities. However, the reality is that Tesla has yet to deliver on that promise. While they have released an advanced driver-assist system called FSD beta, the idea of a Tesla owner being able to nap in their car while it drives itself is far from becoming a reality. In fact, there have been hundreds of crashes involving Tesla vehicles using FSD and Autopilot, as well as multiple deaths. Government agencies are investigating Tesla's claims around self-driving, and a major recall could be on the horizon. The episode features firsthand testing of FSD and other autonomous vehicles, interviews with experts and former Tesla employees, and insights from competitors like General Motors-backed Cruise. The Verge's investigation raises questions about whether Tesla will be able to fulfill its promises without rethinking its hardware strategy.

The discussion revolves around the skepticism surrounding Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) feature and the safety concerns associated with it. One commenter highlights that many people, including technical experts, wrongly believe that Tesla is leading the self-driving industry when in reality, they have not delivered on their promises. Another commenter points out that Waymo and Cruise have significantly more miles logged with fewer incidents compared to Tesla. They argue that Tesla's FSD system requires constant monitoring and is not as advanced as Waymo and Cruise. However, another commenter disagrees and mentions that many people enjoy using FSD and understand its limitations. The discussion also covers the issue of Tesla's safety reports, with one commenter asserting that they consist of unverified crash rates and misleading statistics. They suggest that Tesla's marketing department manipulates the data to present an incomplete safety profile. In contrast, Waymo's reports are said to provide detailed analysis of crash differences. Another commenter brings up multiple instances of Tesla's safety defects, such as failing to recognize road signs and critical deficiencies in its Driver Monitoring System. They argue that these issues persist despite several months of demonstrations and highlight the importance of addressing safety concerns in a self-driving product. One commenter expresses appreciation for the Dawn Project's comprehensive coverage, pointing out that their videos showcase the discrepancies between Tesla's claims and the reality of the FSD system.

#### [Submission URL](http://marble.onl/posts/code_of_practice_and_bias.html) | 13 points | by [andy99](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=andy99) | [9 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37220885)

In a recent article, Andrew Marble discusses the topic of bias in generative AI and explores a newly introduced code of practice for generative AI models. Marble highlights that while addressing bias is important, it is crucial to differentiate between dataset bias and biased system performance. With bigger and smarter models, the focus should shift from data bias to configuring the system properly to ensure unbiased performance. Marble also reflects on a voluntary "code of practice" for generative AI published by Industry Canada, which includes points like identifying malicious and inappropriate use, curating datasets, mitigating biased output, and providing clear identification of AI systems. Marble critiques the requirement to watermark AI-generated content, deeming it unnecessary and easily bypassed. However, Marble agrees with the idea of labeling AI systems to ensure transparency and accountability. Marble then delves into the discussion of bias, emphasizing the need for datasets that are both appropriate and representative. While acknowledging the importance of training data and bias, Marble suggests exercising judgment based on the specific application. In some cases, bias may not be a significant concern. Overall, the article provides insights into bias in generative AI and offers a critical perspective on the proposed code of practice.
