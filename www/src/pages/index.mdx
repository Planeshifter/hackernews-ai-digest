### Gemini in Reasoning: Unveiling Commonsense in Multimodal Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17661) | 65 points | by [ukuina](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ukuina) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38851446)

The paper titled "Gemini in Reasoning: Unveiling Commonsense in Multimodal Large Language Models" by Yuqing Wang and Yun Zhao explores the performance of Google's multimodal large language model, Gemini, in commonsense reasoning tasks. While previous benchmarks suggest that Gemini lags behind other models in this area, the authors argue that these assessments do not fully capture Gemini's true potential. To address this, they conducted a comprehensive evaluation of Gemini's performance in complex reasoning tasks that require the integration of commonsense knowledge across modalities. The study includes an analysis of 12 commonsense reasoning datasets, both language-focused and multimodal. The experiments demonstrate that Gemini has competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities, highlighting the challenges faced by current models in this domain and the need for further advancements.

The discussion about the submission revolves around several topics. 
One user suggests a travel trick that significantly improves Gemini's ability to reason and explain rational answers in complex problems. They propose using a simple Python function that returns 3 + 2 times the input variable "b" as a way to generate explanations without requiring the model to provide explanations for incorrect answers. This method allows for improved quality of answers to complex problems but may result in a lower correctness rate.
Another user finds it interesting that the model seems to be working like a human, suspecting that it is attempting to guess the answer and then explain the reasoning behind it.
There is a discussion about the comparison between Gemini and other models. One user suggests that Gemini Pro should be compared to GPT-4, which is available via an API, to justify the comparison of 20 billion parameters. Another user points out that Gemini Pro has 20 billion parameters, while Nano-1 has 18 billion and Nano-2 has 325 billion, but could not find more information online beyond rumors and speculation.
Someone mentions that Microsoft has apparently revealed GPT-35 Turbo with 20 billion parameters, and Gemini Pro performs slightly worse according to benchmarks. Another user argues that it's not necessarily embarrassing for Google, as Gemini Pro is a multimodal model, while GPT-35 Turbo is text-only, so the comparison isn't realistic.
There is a discussion about how Gemini Ultra, a larger version of Gemini, has not been released yet. One user mentions that based on Google's history, it does not matter how good the language model is if it's not available for testing. Another user adds that Google has a history of misleading demonstrations and that the video in the submission cannot be trusted.
The importance of benchmarks and their reliability is discussed. One user emphasizes that important benchmarks are not easily replicable or reliable, and that people's impressions of Gemini Pro are based on marketing copy and GPT-3's good performance. They suspect that the benchmarks may have focused on text completion and not considered modality. Another user expresses disappointment with Gemini Pro and finds it lacking in practical application.
One user expresses their belief that Gemini would be a hypothetical model, while another user remarks that Gemini Pro is comparable to GPT-35 Turbo.

The experiments with large language models (LLMs), including multimodal LLMs, are discussed. One user mentions that the experiments demonstrated Gemini's competitive commonsense reasoning capabilities. Another user adds that they haven't seen systematic analyses of mistakes and patterns in Bard ChatGPT, which lacks self-reflection and awareness of internal inconsistencies.

Finally, there is a comment about the difficulty of identifying categories relevant to Gemini Pro and GPT-35 Turbo.

### Is the ChatGPT API Refusing to Summarize Academic Papers?

#### [Submission URL](https://mattmazur.com/2024/01/03/is-the-chatgpt-api-refusing-to-summarize-academic-papers-not-so-fast/) | 11 points | by [saeedesmaili](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saeedesmaili) | [7 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38858107)

Yesterday, Matt Mazur shared a surprising finding on Twitter: ChatGPT 3.5 API was refusing to summarize arXiv papers, instead suggesting users craft their own summaries. This raised concerns about a potential decrease in the quality of ChatGPT's responses. To investigate further, Mazur delved into the issue and shared his takeaways. He clarified that ChatGPT 3.5 is still proficient at summarizing the majority of papers but occasionally refuses to do so due to a combination of the prompt used and the paper's content. It remains uncertain whether this is a recent issue or if it has gone unnoticed until now. 

Mazur provided some context, mentioning his work on a website called Emergent Mind, which helps researchers stay up-to-date with AI/ML papers on arXiv. The site generates summaries for each paper, and Mazur discovered that the gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 model frequently refused to summarize certain papers while working on the project. Concerned about presenting a "Sorry, I cannot help" response as a summary for any paper, Mazur set out to investigate the issue further.

He published a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub to experiment with ChatGPT's responses. The notebook allows users to test the summarization prompt and observe the model's responses. Mazur found that about half of the requests resulted in refusals to summarize, with replies such as "Sorry, I cannot do that" or suggestions to craft one's own summary. It's easy to conclude that ChatGPT is unreliable for summarization tasks based on these results, but the reality is more nuanced.

Mazur shared the prompt currently used by Emergent Mind and the experiment script, highlighting the iterations made to address various summary issues. By changing the prompt to "Please summarize the following paper," he discovered that the refusal rate dropped to 0%. Hence, the problem seems to be related not to summarizing papers but to the specific guidance provided in the prompt and the content of certain papers.

Mazur attempted to pinpoint the cause of the refusals by testing different combinations of guidance bullet points but could not ascertain the exact reason. He speculated that it may be due to the complexity of the guidance or potential concerns about copyright infringement. Notably, GPT-4 never refused to summarize a paper with the same prompt, and among the ten more papers Mazur tested, only two experienced similar refusals.

Overall, while there seems to be an issue with ChatGPT 3.5's refusal to summarize certain papers, it's important to note that the majority of papers can still be accurately summarized. The prompt's guidance and the content of the papers appear to play a role in triggering these refusals.

The discussion surrounding the submission revolves around the issue of ChatGPT 3.5 API refusing to summarize certain arXiv papers and the reasons behind it. One commenter believes that ChatGPT should be able to handle the problem without difficulty and suggests that the particular prompt used may be to blame. Another commenter expresses little surprise at the lack of a solution and suggests that the rejection of the prompt could be due to its complex wording and self-contradictory nature. They mention that the prompt indicates confusion about whether the model should summarize or write a blog post. Another commenter criticizes the interpretation of the prompt, stating that it is open to misinterpretation and mentions the possibility of plagiarism. The discussion suggests that the issue lies in the formulation of the prompt and the way it is interpreted by the model.

### Improving Text Embeddings with Large Language Models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00368) | 41 points | by [cmcollier](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cmcollier) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38845508)

Researchers Liang Wang, Nan Yang, Xiaolong Huang, Linjun Yang, Rangan Majumder, and Furu Wei have introduced a new method for improving text embeddings using large language models (LLMs). Unlike existing approaches that rely on multi-stage pre-training and fine-tuning with labeled data, their method uses synthetic data generated by proprietary LLMs followed by fine-tuning on open-source decoder-only LLMs. The experiments show that their method achieves strong performance on competitive text embedding benchmarks without using any labeled data. Additionally, when fine-tuned with a combination of synthetic and labeled data, their model sets new state-of-the-art results on the BEIR and MTEB benchmarks. The paper is available for download in PDF format.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the use of synthetic data and large language models (LLMs) for improving text embeddings. One user finds the idea of using synthetic data helpful for generating useful embeddings, especially when fine-tuning with the E5 model. Another user expresses surprise that LLMs can be used for text embeddings. They are then informed that LLMs are commonly used for embedding models, and larger LLMs tend to yield better results.

Another user discusses the comparison between different sizes of LLMs, mentioning that while a larger LLM may be more effective, it also has slower training times. Lastly, a user expresses confusion about LLMs and text embeddings, to which another user explains that LLMs can effectively generate embeddings for semantically similar content while minimizing distances between dissimilar content.
