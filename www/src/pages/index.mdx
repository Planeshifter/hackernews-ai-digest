### Adventures in Symbolic Algebra with Model Context Protocol

#### [Submission URL](https://www.stephendiehl.com/posts/computer_algebra_mcp/) | 111 points | by [freediver](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=freediver) | [30 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44062130)

In the world of AI and symbolic algebra, a fascinating experiment brings together language models and computer algebra systems using a new protocol known as Model Context Protocol (MCP). The driving force behind this integration is the realization that while language models are adept at understanding natural language math problems, they falter when it comes to solving complex calculations. Conversely, computer algebra systems like Mathematica and SymPy are masters of symbolic manipulation but come with highly specialized, cryptic interfaces.

MCP emerges as the bridge between these two realms, similar to the way USB-C aims to standardize connectivity. By connecting language models to external tools via REST APIs, MCP allows each system to play to its strengths in a seamless manner. The protocol, likened to a "cgi-bin of AI," enables a local server to serve as a hub where LLMs can invoke external mathematical tools, albeit with an accompanying security risk—making it a powerful yet potentially hazardous tool.

The author shares their weekend of experimentation with MCP, detailing both the challenges and breakthroughs. The setup, characterized by scattered documentation reminiscent of Wild West frontier towns and a reliance on Node.js, involves a mix of modern technology and echoing hackathon vibes. Debugging becomes an esoteric process due to the non-deterministic behavior inherent in LLMs, with successes punctuated by whimsical failures and unexplained hiccups.

Despite these hurdles, the MCP-powered integration promises a more accurate approach to solving intricate mathematical problems, such as tensor calculus in general relativity, where traditional LLMs often fall short. The experiment underscores the potential of MCP to unlock new synergies, as highlighted with a simple code demonstration where an LLM uses MCP to correctly factor a large integer by leveraging the GNU factor command—a task that would otherwise leave the model generating creative but incorrect responses.

Ultimately, this innovative melding of AI and symbolic algebra through MCP stands as a testament to grappling with modern technological challenges head-on, aiming to harness the best of both artificial intelligence and computational mathematics. For those willing to embark on this frontier journey, the author's source code is available on GitHub to enable further exploration and collaboration.

### Problems in AI alignment: A scale model

#### [Submission URL](https://muldoon.cloud/2025/05/22/alignment.html) | 45 points | by [hamburga](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hamburga) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44065775)

A deep exploration into the conversation around AI alignment takes a quirky turn, embracing the millennial tradition of using memes to make sense of complex topics. At the heart of the discussion lies the question of why AI alignment seems to attract an intense focus, with its own Wikipedia page, while other industries like pharmaceuticals or education do not. The answer seems to lie in AI's inherently technical nature, contrasting with the broader, decentralized way ethical considerations are typically applied across society, akin to natural selection.

The author argues that AI alignment is akin to "Selection" in evolution, suggesting that societal influences shape industries through purchasing, regulation, and discourse. This process is decentralized, much like evolution itself. Yet, unlike evolution, humanity can guide this selection process with ethical intentions.

The piece posits that while technical problems in AI alignment are indeed crucial, the larger issue is how AI integrates with society and the ethical considerations surrounding that integration—what the author dubs the "Big Question" of AI alignment. Ignoring this broader context, the author warns, risks missing the forest for the trees.

For those interested in applying sociotechnical protocols to enhance this form of selection, the author suggests exploring the resources like the article linked (https://muldoon.cloud/2025/03/08/civic-organizing.html). Thus, memes aside, this piece challenges us to consider not just the technical alignment of AI but how it fits within the grand scheme of human and ethical evolution.

The discussion on AI alignment weaves through technical, ethical, and societal dimensions, reflecting both urgency and skepticism. Key points include:

1. **Technical Core vs. Societal Integration**:  
   Participants debate whether AI alignment is primarily a mathematical/engineering challenge (e.g., avoiding reward hacking, Goodhart’s Law pitfalls) or a broader sociotechnical issue. Some argue that focusing solely on technical solutions risks ignoring systemic factors, such as market incentives and societal values, which shape AI’s evolution.

2. **Existential Risks & Historical Context**:  
   References to early alignment thinkers (e.g., Eliezer Yudkowsky) highlight long-standing fears of superintelligent AI misalignment, likened to sci-fi narratives like Asimov’s *Three Laws of Robots*. Skeptics question if today’s AI (e.g., LLMs) poses existential threats, contrasting these fears with immediate risks like biased decision-making or military misuse.

3. **Systemic & Market Failures**:  
   Analogies to “Lemon Markets” illustrate how information asymmetry and profit motives degrade ethical standards in AI development. Critics argue corporate interests often overshadow safety, creating misaligned incentives (e.g., prioritizing user engagement over truth).

4. **Defining Human Values**:  
   A central challenge is encoding abstract human ethics into AI systems. Participants note the difficulty of translating nebulous values into code without bias, especially as cultural and political norms vary. Comparisons to governance structures (e.g., democracies vs. dictatorships) underscore the complexity of institutional alignment.

5. **Skepticism & Pragmatism**:  
   Some dismiss existential risk discourse as hyperbolic, arguing that real-world harms (e.g., AI-driven labor exploitation, flawed medical algorithms) deserve more attention. Others advocate for iterative, interdisciplinary approaches, blending technical rigor with sociopolitical awareness.

In essence, the debate reveals tension between solving alignment as a technical puzzle versus addressing it as a dynamic, societal process shaped by human flaws and systemic pressures. The consensus leans toward a hybrid approach: advancing engineering safeguards while critically examining the economic, political, and ethical ecosystems in which AI evolves.

In the eerily prescient tale "The Machine Stops," we're drawn into a world where humanity has become entirely dependent on an autonomous system known as "the Machine." In a hexagonal room devoid of traditional windows or lamps, Vashti, a figure disconnected from the outside world, lives a life dictated by the conveniences of technology. Her son, Kuno, reaches out through this mechanical marvel to express a yearning that sets him apart—a desire to break free from this virtual cocoon and experience genuine human connection.

Kuno implores Vashti to visit him in person, presenting a stark contrast to their screen-mediated interactions. His longing to see the stars from the earth, rather than the confines of an airship, speaks to a deeper wish to reconnect with a world once brimming with tangible life. Vashti, however, is resistant, preferring the sterile comfort of her mechanized environment to the uncertain authenticity of the surface world. Her reluctance mirrors a society that has traded depth and reality for the fleeting convenience of machine-mediated experiences.

The story explores themes of dependency on technology, the erosion of direct human interaction, and the lost appreciation for the natural world. Kuno's desire for face-to-face communication and his metaphor of stars resembling a sword-wielding man hint at a profound discontent with a life lived through filters and screens. It's an evocative narrative that prompts reflection on our current trajectory with technology and the vital elements of the human experience we risk losing.

In a recent deep dive, the limitations of scaling language model (LLM) function calls in machine-control protocol (MCP) tools become abundantly clear. Current methods involve feeding the entire output from tool calls back into the LLM and hoping it can decipher the data to trigger subsequent actions. While this approach works in small, controlled environments, adding larger, real-world data scales up both complexity and cost, revealing significant inefficiencies.

The key issue lies in treating data and task orchestration as part of a single conversation with the LLM, a method that struggles with structured data like the JSON blobs returned by tools such as Linear and Intercom. These blobs, although similar to typical APIs, lack predefined schemas, making parsing challenging. Consequently, the LLM often ends up reposting this bulky data, leading to slow processing times and potential data inaccuracies.

Enter orchestration through code execution. By using code to interpret and manage data, we tap into a system that’s not only more intuitive but also infinitely scalable. Variables within code can store data natively, eliminating the need for cumbersome external systems. Meanwhile, well-choreographed tool chaining allows for efficient function calls and data processing without forcing the LLM to regurgitate vast data sets.

As MCP specs evolve to define output schemas, this new structured approach is set to unlock use cases like building custom dashboards and generating reports. However, this transition demands a shift in how execution environments handle security and persistence, especially when dealing with AI-generated code and sensitive tool access. The solution, potentially a new class of "AI runtimes," must balance robust security measures and the ability to handle prolonged, stateful operations.

The community is invited to explore and refine this groundbreaking avenue, with platforms like Lutra offering an open door for collaborative innovation.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around challenges and solutions for scaling LLM-driven systems, particularly in managing structured data and workflow orchestration. Key points include:

1. **Structured Data & Determinism**:  
   Participants emphasize the need for **structured data schemas** (e.g., typed JSON) to reduce ambiguity and improve reliability. While LLMs struggle with unstructured data blobs, deterministic code or hybrid approaches (e.g., combining LLMs with traditional algorithms) are seen as critical for tasks like report generation or dashboard creation. However, LLMs’ probabilistic nature completely deterministic outcomes, requiring fallback strategies.

2. **Code Orchestration vs. LLM Reliance**:  
   Many advocate for **code-based orchestration** (e.g., Shopify’s open-source [Roast](https://github.com/Shopify/roast)) to handle workflows deterministically, reserving LLMs for ambiguous sub-tasks. This reduces cognitive load on models and avoids repetitive data regurgitation. Others propose domain-specific languages (DSLs) or symbolic systems as alternatives to pure LLM-driven logic.

3. **Real-World Use Cases & Tools**:  
   - Shopify’s Roast framework is praised for blending deterministic and non-deterministic steps in workflows (e.g., customer support automation).  
   - Tools like GraphQL and custom gateways are suggested to streamline MCP/API interactions by filtering unnecessary data upfront.  
   - Skepticism exists about overhyped “AI-native” solutions, with some noting past failures in AI-driven predictions and the importance of incremental, practical applications.

4. **Challenges & Trade-offs**:  
   - **Execution errors** (e.g., hallucinated dashboard metrics) and **state management** in distributed systems remain hurdles.  
   - Security concerns arise with AI-generated code, necessitating sandboxed “AI runtimes.”  
   - Debate persists on balancing flexibility (LLMs) vs. structure (code), with some arguing current models still lack the reliability for mission-critical tasks.

5. **Community Sentiment**:  
   While some express optimism about evolving specs (e.g., MCP schemas) enabling new use cases, others are cynical about the industry’s fixation on LLMs for problems solvable with simpler, deterministic systems. The tension between rapid experimentation and delivering robust production solutions is evident.

**Final Takeaway**: The path forward likely involves hybrid systems—leveraging LLMs for ambiguity resolution within tightly scoped, code-orchestrated workflows—while prioritizing structured data and rigorous error handling. Platforms like Lutra and Roast exemplify this balance, but scalability and security remain open challenges.

### Building an agentic image generator that improves itself

#### [Submission URL](https://simulate.trybezel.com/research/image_agent) | 61 points | by [palashshah](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=palashshah) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44051090)

In the fast-evolving world of digital marketing, the need for dynamically tailored advertisements is more critical than ever. A recent story from Bezel demonstrates innovative strides in this field, detailing the creation of an agentic image generator powered by OpenAI’s API. At Bezel, they specialize in building personas—detailed user models—that help major brands better target their advertisements. The challenge: turning these personas into actual ad content.

Employing OpenAI’s Image API, Bezel’s approach engages two endpoints for image creation and editing. The /create endpoint generates images from prompts, while the /edit endpoint tweaks them based on user specifications—such as masking certain sections for enhancement. To ensure the output images meet high standards, Bezel turned to advanced large language models (LLMs), treating them as critique engines. These evaluators spotlight errors like text blurriness or an underwhelming visual draw, establishing a guided feedback loop facilitating iterative improvements.

Here's a breakdown of their methodology: Initially utilizing a text-focused perspective with the "LLM-as-a-Judge" system, the strategy entailed a precise definition of visual flaws—using models like o3 and gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04 to scan for, and correct, imperfections in text rendering. For instance, they confronted issues like the indistinct labeling on RedBull cans in an imagined ad scenario. Utilizing an iterative editing function, they achieved significant text clarity with around three refinements per image, suggesting a technical performance limit.

The innovation didn't stop there. Bezel expanded their system’s evaluative capacity to assess abstract aspects, such as overall image composition and consumer appeal. They posed questions concerning visual harmony and engagement potential—things the LLMs could judge based on the criteria set by Bezel's detailed personas.

Through this exploratory and iterative technique, Bezel is not just enhancing the aesthetic and functional quality of AI-generated images but also advancing towards an autonomous, self-improving system that can deliver advertisements that are spot-on for every niche demographic—or persona—it encounters. This progression marks a pivotal step in not only just-in-time marketing but also in the broader landscape of artificial intelligence's role in digital creativity.

Are you fascinated by polynomial multiplication and its deeper connections to concepts like convolution in signals and systems? Eli Bendersky's post is here to unravel these intriguing mathematical relationships for you. 

It kicks off with a classic exercise from middle school math—multiplying two polynomials through cross-multiplication and summing up like terms. But then it delves into a more structured way to tackle the same problem using a table method, where you multiply diagonally aligned terms from two polynomials laid out in rows and columns to collect coefficients. This approach reveals an interesting diagonal pattern and leads to a more abstract perspective on polynomial multiplication.

The post then introduces the formal mathematical formulation: for two polynomials P and R, their product polynomial S can be calculated as a sum of products of coefficients from P and R, rearranged in a specific way. This setup is not just another method but a key to understanding the deeper ideas behind polynomial multiplication.

Furthermore, the piece draws a parallel to convolution sums—a concept central to digital signal processing. If multiplying polynomials sounds akin to computing convolutions, that's because it truly is! Bendersky explains how discrete signals and systems can be represented and manipulated using similar methods, highlighting the elegance of this abstraction. Graphical representations in the post help illustrate these concepts, showing how flipping and shifting polynomial alignments yield the terms of the product polynomial.

We all turn to AI daily, whether for homework help, creating art, or generating videos. But have you ever wondered about the energy it takes to power this AI revolution? MIT Technology Review's latest analysis unveils the staggering energy demands behind every AI query, raising questions about the industry's transparency and future impact on our power grids.

AI's energy footprint isn't just about simple queries; it's about a colossal infrastructure shift. Tech giants like Meta and Microsoft are investing heavily in energy projects, with initiatives as ambitious as new nuclear power plants and expansive data centers, each potentially consuming more power than the entire state of New Hampshire.

The AI energy story is part of a broader narrative. While data centers once maintained steady electricity usage through improved efficiencies, the rise of AI has doubled their consumption since 2017. Currently, they're responsible for 4.4% of the US's power usage, and it's projected that by 2028, over half of the electricity to data centers will fuel AI.

Alarmingly, as AI's reach grows—promising personalized services and complex problem-solving—the environmental toll is set to rise. Many AI operations run on more carbon-intensive energy as they quickly scale operations, leaving significant emissions behind. Predictions suggest that AI could eventually consume as much power annually as nearly a quarter of US households.

This energy surge comes amidst calls for transparency. Critics argue that the lack of detailed energy data from AI companies obscures effective planning for future demands and emissions. With AI models inching toward being the fifth-most visited online service globally, the stakes are high, not just for tech companies but for utility providers and governments worldwide.

Ultimately, navigating AI's unchecked energy demands will require a delicate balancing act—making AI’s consumption visible, equitable, and sustainable as we step into this new techno-future.

The Hacker News discussion on AI's energy consumption reveals several key themes and debates:

1. **Energy Concerns & Environmental Impact**:  
   Users express alarm over AI's growing energy demands, with comparisons to carbon-intensive activities like "rolling coal" (intentionally emitting diesel smoke). Some note that generating a single AI query (0.3–40 Wh) pales next to the environmental cost of such practices (10,000–100,000+ grams of CO2). However, critics argue AI's rapid scaling could still strain grids and worsen emissions.

2. **Tech Industry Transparency**:  
   Skepticism arises about tech giants (Meta, Google, etc.) not disclosing detailed energy data, complicating efforts to quantify AI's true footprint. Some users highlight initiatives like nuclear power investments but question their feasibility and timelines.

3. **Carbon Tax Debates**:  
   A contentious thread debates carbon taxes. Proponents argue they incentivize green tech, while opponents call them regressive, disproportionately affecting low-income groups. Revenue-neutral models (e.g., Canada’s rebate system) are discussed, though criticized as misunderstood or politically unpopular.

4. **AI Efficiency vs. Benefits**:  
   While some defend AI’s energy use as justified by societal benefits (e.g., education, problem-solving), others counter that unchecked growth risks outweighing gains. Technical users dissect energy metrics, comparing model sizes (e.g., DeepSeek’s 600B parameters) and query efficiency.

### OpenAI Codex hands-on review

#### [Submission URL](https://zackproser.com/blog/openai-codex-review) | 150 points | by [fragmede](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fragmede) | [112 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44042070)

Imagine having an assistant that manages all your Git projects effortlessly, allowing you to focus on the bigger picture while it handles the boring details. This is precisely the vision of Codex, OpenAI's innovative platform that promises a seamless integration with GitHub to boost your productivity. However, like any tech in its early days, it’s not quite there yet.

Codex is a chat-focused tool that, once you're in, requires multi-factor authentication and some setup over at GitHub. It clones your repositories into its special sandboxes, letting you execute commands and create branches without ever leaving the interface. This setup means if you manage lots of repos, it feels like a powerhouse. But, if you're working on just one or two, it might feel like an overkill compared to a simple AI editor like Cursor.

One of the standout features of Codex is its multi-threaded approach. If you’re someone who dreams of launching your tasks in parallel and letting the code compile while you enjoy a peaceful walk in nature, Codex might be up your alley. You can toss various tasks at it, follow up via chats, check logs, and even let it handle opening pull requests for your features.

The platform isn't without its quirks, though. It struggles a bit with error handling and tends to open new pull requests for every little change, rather than allowing smooth updates to existing ones. Plus, shout out to all you devs: Codex doesn't brave the internet to solve dependency woes just yet, leaving you to handle them locally.

As for whether Codex supercharges productivity? Not exactly, not yet. But the potential is undeniably there. Once it improves multi-tasking, branch updates, and extends its integration capabilities—perhaps by weaving in more of OpenAI's platform goodies—it could well become the dream tool many devs have been waiting for. Until then, Codex serves as a promising glimpse into a more orchestrated future of software development, where a robust digital assistant truly changes the game.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion reflects mixed reactions to OpenAI's Codex, with users highlighting both potential and significant limitations:  

1. **Frustrations with Codex's UX and Reliability**:  
   - Users report a clunky setup process, unstable GitHub integration (disconnects/errors), and "blank screens" during use.  
   - Environment limitations (e.g., no container support, internet access) hinder resolving dependencies or running tests.  
   - Some compare it unfavorably to alternatives like **Cursor** (simpler for smaller projects) or **Claude/Gemini** (better context handling).  

2. **Workflow Successes and Challenges**:  
   - Parallel task execution and iterative prompting can yield results, especially for mid-sized projects, but require meticulous prompt tuning.  
   - Git integration is criticized: Codex auto-opens excessive PRs for minor changes and struggles with commit rollbacks.  

3. **Debates About LLMs Replacing Developers**:  
   - Non-technical users leveraging Codex to replace engineers is deemed exaggerated.  
   - Many argue that **problem-solving** and **system design skills** remain irreplaceable, even if LLMs automate code generation. Skeptics link to articles questioning AI’s readiness to replace skilled roles.  

4. **Practical Tradeoffs**:  
   - Codex can save time on boilerplate tasks but demands oversight to avoid “AI-generated spaghetti code.”  
   - Developers emphasize that **terminal/CLI proficiency**, debugging, and understanding frameworks remain critical barriers for non-technical users.  

**Verdict**: While Codex shows promise for parallel task management and code generation, its current limitations in UX, environment flexibility, and workflow maturity make it feel like a “half-baked” tool. Users agree it’s not yet a productivity game-changer but could evolve with better error handling, branch management, and deeper integration with OpenAI’s ecosystem. The broader discussion underscores skepticism about AI replacing developers but acknowledges its role in augmenting workflows—*if* the technical hurdles are addressed.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13400) | 142 points | by [nopinsight](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nopinsight) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44043323)

In a thrilling development on the path to revolutionizing scientific research, a recent paper unveils "Robin," an innovative multi-agent AI system designed to automate the entire scientific discovery process. Presented by a team of ten researchers, Robin represents a quantum leap in AI capabilities, orchestrating literature reviews, hypothesis formation, experimentation, and data analysis within a seamless, integrated workflow.

This groundbreaking system has already demonstrated its potential by identifying a novel treatment for dry age-related macular degeneration (dAMD), a leading cause of blindness. Robin's proposed strategy enhances retinal pigment epithelium phagocytosis and pinpoints the rho kinase (ROCK) inhibitor ripasudil as a promising therapeutic candidate. Previously unconsidered for dAMD, ripasudil's efficacy was further explored through RNA-seq experiments autonomously suggested by Robin. These efforts unveiled the role of ABCA1, a lipid efflux pump, as a potential target.

Remarkably, Robin's scientific prowess was fully exhibited throughout the creation of this report, as it autonomously generated all hypotheses, experimental methodologies, data analyses, and visual data presentations. The introduction of such an AI system marks the dawn of a new era in scientific exploration, promising to accelerate research across disciplines.

In related news, arXiv is on the hunt for a DevOps Engineer, offering a rare chance to contribute to one of the most significant digital platforms in open science. If you're enthusiastic about pushing the boundaries of AI and scientific advancement, this could be a remarkable opportunity.

2. **Methodological & Data Concerns:**  
   - Discussion questioned the study’s focus on **ABCA1**, highlighting potential gaps in genetic (GWAS) and RNA-seq data validation. Some argued that AI-suggested experiments might oversimplify biological mechanisms without sufficient context.  
   - Others noted resource constraints: labs might struggle to validate AI-generated hypotheses efficiently, especially if experiments require sophisticated setups (e.g., RNA-seq).  

3. **Patent & Accessibility Issues:**  
   - Debate arose over **ripasudil**, the proposed therapeutic compound. Existing patents (e.g., from Kowa) could block affordable access, mirroring historical cases like Prontosil/sulfanilamide.  
   - Calls were made for prioritizing non-patented compounds or public-domain solutions to avoid profit-driven restrictions hindering research.  

4. **Role of AI in the Research Pipeline:**  
   - Some argued AI could handle theoretical work (hypothesis generation, literature review) while humans focus on experiments. However, skeptics highlighted practical challenges: AI lacks "real-world" intuition, and closed-loop optimization (e.g., designing experiments) remains unresolved.  
   - Resource bottlenecks (funding, lab capacity) and the irreplaceable value of human expertise in interpreting results were recurring themes.  

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   - Users debated whether big labs would monopolize AI tools, sidelining public research. Others questioned how well AI systems integrate domain-specific knowledge or generalize across disciplines.  
   - A meta-point emerged: while AI accelerates discovery, systemic issues (patents, funding inequities, reproducibility) require human-driven solutions.  

**Overall Sentiment:** The community acknowledges Robin's potential but stresses that AI is a tool, not a replacement for rigorous validation, ethical oversight, or addressing structural barriers in science.

### The Lisp in the Cellar: Dependent types that live upstairs [pdf]

#### [Submission URL](https://zenodo.org/records/15424968) | 83 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44041515)

The European Lisp Symposium has unveiled an intriguing development in the realm of programming languages with "The Lisp in the Cellar." Researchers Pierre-Evariste Dagand and Frederic Peschanski have introduced the Deputy system, a Clojure-hosted programming language boasting dependent types. This cutting-edge system allows developers to partake in type-level computation intertwined with interactive programming, leveraging the dynamic Lisp-based REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop). Despite its dynamic approach to types, Deputy ensures all type-checking is completed during compile-time, combining the flexibility of Lisp with the rigors of dependently-typed logic.

The uniqueness of Deputy lies in its seamless integration into Clojure, thus allowing developers to remain within familiar territory when transitioning to type-level programming. Presented at the 18th European Lisp Symposium in Zurich, this research holds potential to reshape how the programming community approaches type systems, making it a significant contribution to the ongoing evolution of software development methodologies.

For those interested in diving deeper, the full paper is accessible on Zenodo under a Creative Commons Attribution No Derivatives 4.0 International license. So far, it has garnered an impressive amount of attention with over 11,000 views and nearly 10,000 downloads, indicating its substantial impact and growing interest within the tech community.

In an intriguing development in the field of artificial intelligence, a position paper titled "The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis" has sparked discussions on Hacker News. Authored by a team from prestigious institutions like MIT, University of British Columbia, and University of Oxford, the paper delves into how neural networks internally construct their outputs. Specifically, it juxtaposes the conventional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) training method with networks evolved through an open-ended search process on task as simple as generating a single image. 

The study yields fascinating insights—while both methods achieve similar output behaviors, their internal neuron representations significantly differ. Networks trained via SGD exhibit what the authors call a "fractured entangled representation" (FER), which might hamper abilities like generalization and creativity. In contrast, evolved networks tend toward a more organized representation structure. This distinction could have profound implications for advancing AI's ability to learn continuously.

The released repository on GitHub provides code and supplementary data, enabling enthusiasts and researchers to analyze, reproduce, and visualize these findings. For those interested, the project includes a Google Colab notebook for easy exploration and a contact link for further inquiries or to access additional Picbreeder genomes. To cite this work, there's even a ready-to-go BibTeX entry.

This paper challenges the conventional wisdom that better performance inherently means better internal representations, opening up new avenues for research in AI representation learning.

   - Users contrast stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with evolutionary/open-ended search processes. Some suggest biologically plausible forward-forward algorithms might yield more interpretable representations.  
   - Evolved networks’ structured representations are seen as advantageous for generalization, while SGD’s "fractured entangled" representations (FER) may hinder creativity and robustness.  

2. **Interpretability Challenges**  
   - Skepticism arises about linear methods (e.g., PCA, linear probes) for analyzing neural networks. Critics argue these tools fail to capture the complexity of entangled representations, with references to Neel Nanda’s Othello experiments and sparse autoencoders (SAEs).  
   - Debates emerge over whether linear transformations or rotational matrices can "untangle" latent spaces, with some users questioning the practicality of such approaches.  

3. **Criticisms and Practical Implications**  
   - A user dismisses the paper’s findings as "worthless," arguing that subjective preferences for "beautiful" mathematical representations don’t predict network efficacy. Others counter that structured representations (e.g., via weight decay regularization) improve model performance, especially in deeper layers.  
   - Concerns about the AI research field’s focus on scaling existing systems rather than fundamental breakthroughs are raised, alongside calls for more "high-throughput thinking" to address core challenges.  

4. **Side Discussions**  
   - A meta-debate occurs about Hacker News guidelines, with users discussing whether linking to the paper and a related tweet violates community rules. Some defend the inclusion as valuable context.

### AI in my plasma physics research didn’t go the way I expected

#### [Submission URL](https://www.understandingai.org/p/i-got-fooled-by-ai-for-science-hypeheres) | 352 points | by [qianli_cs](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qianli_cs) | [279 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44037941)

Nick McGreivy, a recent Princeton PhD graduate and plasma physicist, has candidly shared his journey with AI in scientific research, particularly in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). McGreivy initially embraced the AI-for-science hype, motivated by its potential to revolutionize physics and its appealing career opportunities. However, he soon discovered that many AI methods, despite being lauded in numerous studies, often underperform compared to traditional numerical techniques when properly evaluated.

McGreivy’s key focus was on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), a novel AI approach to solving PDEs that promised superior speed and efficiency. Yet, his experiments led to disappointing results, revealing that AI solutions were not the unparalleled breakthroughs they were claimed to be. He found that the advantages of AI methods often disappeared under rigorous, fair comparisons with state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

This experience, and others like it, have fueled skepticism about AI’s transformative impact on scientific progress. High-profile AI claims, such as DeepMind's controversial work on crystal structures, have been criticized for overstating their contributions. Furthermore, pervasive issues like data leakage in AI research raise concerns about validity and reproducibility, casting doubt on the real impact of AI breakthroughs.

Despite these challenges, AI adoption in research is rapidly increasing across various fields. Yet, McGreivy warns that this surge might reflect more on scientists' incentives and publication biases rather than genuine scientific advancement. AI's potential in science, while promising, may not be as revolutionary as anticipated, contributing more to gradual, incremental progress than ground-breaking discoveries.

Ultimately, McGreivy emphasizes that while AI remains a powerful tool for scientific inquiry, its adoption should be cautious and evidence-based, avoiding the pitfalls of sensationalism and unwarranted optimism. The path to scientific progress is complex, and AI's role in it is likely to be a supporting, rather than a leading, element.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around Nick McGreivy’s critique of AI in scientific research highlights widespread skepticism about current AI methodologies, particularly in solving complex problems like partial differential equations (PDEs). Key themes include:

1. **Skepticism of AI’s Superiority**:  
   Commenters note that AI techniques, such as Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), often fail to outperform traditional numerical methods (e.g., FEM solvers) in rigorous comparisons. Users shared firsthand experiences of AI models being slower, less accurate, or unstable for nonlinear problems, with one engineer stating AI solutions “[fell] apart” under practical conditions.

2. **Systemic Issues in Academia**:  
   Many criticize academic incentives driving hype. Researchers are pressured to chase trendy AI topics for funding and publications, leading to overstated claims and cherry-picked benchmarks. Negative results or honest critiques are rarely published, skewing perceptions of AI’s utility. Resource disparities—where only well-funded labs can compete in AI—further distort the field.

3. **Reproducibility and Overfitting Concerns**:  
   Comments highlight issues like data leakage, questionable benchmarking (e.g., medical imaging studies using biased datasets), and irreproducible “breakthroughs.” One user likened AI research to “magic_benchmark” manipulation, where academic papers prioritize flashy metrics over real-world applicability.

4. **Historical Context and Terminology**:  
   Participants argue that many “AI innovations” rebrand older techniques (e.g., expert systems, statistical models). The fluid definition of “AI” itself is criticized as marketing-driven, obscuring incremental progress.

5. **Cultural Pushback**:  
   Some defend traditional science, lamenting that skepticism toward AI is often dismissed as “utter nonsense” despite valid concerns. Others note broader institutional failures, where academic systems reward self-promotion over rigorous science, likening it to “gaming” funding agencies and publication metrics.

6. **Cautious Optimism**:  
   While acknowledging AI’s potential for specific niche applications (e.g., curvature detection in data), most urge tempered expectations. Incremental improvements, not revolutions, are seen as AI’s likely contribution to science.

In summary, the discussion underscores a disillusionment with AI hyperbole and calls for greater rigor, honesty, and systemic reform in scientific research to balance innovation with accountability.

In short, the discussion reflects cautious optimism, with users eager for alternatives to centralized platforms but wary of technical and adoption challenges.

### Questioning Representational Optimism in Deep Learning

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/akarshkumar0101/fer) | 43 points | by [mattdesl](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mattdesl) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44038549)

In the world of AI and neural networks, a new position paper titled "The Fractured Entangled Representation Hypothesis" is turning heads by challenging the conventional wisdom about neural network internal representations. Authored by researchers from institutions like MIT and the University of Oxford, the paper delves into how scaling up AI systems influences their inner workings, rather than just their performance outcomes.

The study compares traditional neural networks trained through stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with those evolved via an open-ended search process, focusing on the task of generating a single image. This approach allows each neuron's function within the network to be visualized, offering a rare window into how these networks construct their outputs.

The findings reveal a stark difference between the two methods: SGD-trained networks often exhibit a disorganized structure, described as a "fractured entangled representation" (FER). This chaotic interior might hinder key capabilities like generalization and creativity. On the flip side, networks evolved through open-ended methods tend to sport more organized, unified representations.

This revelation raises important questions about the future of neural-network training approaches. Could managing or mitigating FER be crucial for advancing AI's representational capabilities?

For those interested in exploring the data and methodologies used in this research, the authors have shared their code on GitHub, complete with visualizations and supplementary data. It's a call to the community to dive deeper into understanding and possibly overcoming the limitations presented by FER, which might just be key to unlocking the more robust AI systems of tomorrow.

Here's a concise summary of the discussion:

1. **Interest and Critique of Conventional AI Approaches**:  
   Users highlight the paper’s significance for challenging the AI research community’s focus on scaling (e.g., model size, dataset size) and assuming larger/more data inherently leads to progress. Critics argue this “scale-first” mindset risks overemphasizing superficial metrics, especially in LLMs, at the cost of understanding how representations form internally.

2. **Fractured Representations and Generalization**:  
   The discussion emphasizes the paper’s argument that "fractured entangled representations" (FER) in SGD-trained networks might hinder generalization and creativity. This contrasts with open-evolved networks showing more coherent structures. A user questions how this applies practically to modern LLMs, speculating whether ad-hoc training methods inadvertently produce disorganized representations that limit reasoning or emergent capabilities.

3. **Calls for Deeper Investigation**:  
   Users debate whether LLMs truly build semantically organized representations or rely on statistical correlations, noting a need to analyze how training processes (e.g., SGD vs. open-ended search) shape internal structures. One user asks for concrete examples linking FER to real-world LLM behaviors (e.g., coding errors, summarization), but it’s clarified the paper doesn’t address this directly.

4. **Stylistic Reaction**:  
   A lighthearted comment mocks the paper’s complex title, reflecting broader tensions in how AI concepts are communicated.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion reveals enthusiasm for rethinking neural network training paradigms but underscores gaps in connecting theoretical hypotheses (like FER) to observed limitations in today's LLMs. Further empirical work is needed to determine whether addressing fractured representations could unlock new capabilities.

A recent study has ignited concerns in the field of psychological assessment, particularly regarding the misuse of AI technology in clinical settings. Published in the journal "Psychological Injury and Law," researchers explored whether ChatGPT, a popular AI language model, could help students convincingly feign symptoms of ADHD during neuropsychological evaluations. The study's findings reveal a potential loophole that could undermine the effectiveness of diagnostic tools.

In this experiment, 110 university students were divided into three groups: a control group, a symptom-coached group, and an AI-coached group. Participants in the AI-coached group used ChatGPT—fed with tailored queries from 22 students—to generate advice on how to mimic ADHD symptoms. The results were quite telling. Those coached by the AI managed to moderate their symptoms and cognitive performance in a way that lowered detection sensitivity, compared to those who were merely coached on simulating symptoms.

The implications are significant, suggesting that AI tools, such as chatbots, can assist in fabricating symptoms of ADHD, posing a threat to the integrity of clinical assessments. This revelation underlines the need for researchers and clinicians to be vigilant in how assessment materials are shared, emphasizing caution with such technologies.

The study highlights the broader concern of how AI can be misused to gain undue benefits. These include extended time on exams, access to medications, and other accommodations. As the prevalence of adults meeting ADHD diagnostic criteria is notable, with a global rate of around 2.58%, ensuring the validity and reliability of assessments is crucial. This study calls for enhanced scrutiny in diagnostic procedures and a reconsideration of how AI tools are integrated into clinical practice.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding the study on ChatGPT's ability to help students feign ADHD symptoms revolves around several key themes and debates:

### 1. **Study Implications and Methodology**  
   - Users note the study’s finding that AI-coached participants were more effective at evading detection than those merely coached on symptoms. This raises concerns about the vulnerability of diagnostic tools to AI-assisted manipulation.  
   - Skepticism is expressed about the practical impact, with some arguing that over-reporting symptoms (e.g., depression, anxiety) is already common and that clinicians can detect inconsistencies.  

### 2. **ADHD Medication Access and Regulation**  
   - Discussions highlight systemic issues, such as DEA production quotas for stimulants like Adderall, which are blamed for shortages and incentivizing misuse. Users criticize the regulatory framework for prioritizing diversion control over patient access.  
   - Alternatives like Vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) are mentioned, but their stricter regulation (C2 classification) complicates availability.  

### 3. **Ethical and Societal Pressures**  
   - Many commenters share frustrations about people faking ADHD for academic accommodations (e.g., extended test time) or stimulant prescriptions. Parents describe challenges in managing their children’s legitimate ADHD treatment amid fears of misuse.  
   - Broader societal pressures, such as academic performance demands and workplace productivity, are cited as drivers for misuse. Some argue stimulants are used as “cognitive enhancers” in competitive environments.  

### 4. **Historical and Cultural Context**  
   - A historical perspective on amphetamines (e.g., Benzedrine in the mid-20th century) is provided, linking past cultural acceptance to current debates about stimulant use.  

### 5. **AI’s Broader Misuse Potential**  
   - Beyond ADHD, users reference unrelated AI misuse cases, such as a (likely fictional) anecdote about a student in Finland using ChatGPT to plan a knife attack. This underscores fears about AI’s role in enabling harmful behavior.  

### 6. **Skepticism and Solutions**  
   - Some dismiss the study’s relevance, arguing that objective tests (e.g., tracking micro-movements during cognitive tasks) could better detect faking. Others call for stricter diagnostic protocols or AI-detection tools.  
   - Critiques of online ADHD diagnosis platforms (e.g., 10-question surveys) highlight systemic flaws in healthcare accessibility and oversight.  

### Key Takeaways:  
The discussion reflects a mix of alarm over AI’s role in undermining clinical assessments, frustration with regulatory bottlenecks, and resignation to societal pressures driving stimulant misuse. While some users advocate for systemic reforms (e.g., revising DEA quotas), others emphasize personal responsibility or improved diagnostic tools to address the issue.
