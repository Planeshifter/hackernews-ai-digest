### Personality Basins

#### [Submission URL](https://near.blog/personality-basins/) | 155 points | by [qouteall](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=qouteall) | [108 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42203635)

In a thought-provoking post, a user dives deep into the concept of "personality basins," likening the development of personality to machine learning processes like reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). The author suggests that our personalities are not fixed traits but rather shaped continuously by interactions with our environment, much like how a machine learning model adapts based on feedback. 

Born with certain genetic traits, individuals navigate their world, honing specific behaviors through positive or negative reinforcement. Adolescence emerges as a critical period for this learning, marked by high social and environmental entropy that enhances neuroplasticity, enabling youth to rapidly adapt their personalities to succeed in their circumstances. 

The user introduces the idea of personality as a landscape of potential traits, where one's experiences mold their identity over time, eventually leading them to settle into a “basin” that reflects their successful adaptations. Most changes to personality happen unconsciously, as our brains constantly adjust behavior based on what works or doesn't in our social contexts. Recognizing this can lead to self-reflection on how we form preferences and behaviors, shedding light on how environment and social contexts shape our perceptions and identities.

Overall, the analogy helps to frame personality as dynamic and adaptable, inviting readers to contemplate their own journeys and the nuanced factors that influence who they are.

The discussion surrounding the concept of "personality basins" from the original submission brings up a multitude of perspectives, especially in relation to genetics and environmental factors. 

Participants generally engage with the analogy of personality formation resembling reinforcement learning, where behaviors are continuously adjusted based on experiences and feedback. Some commenters highlight that while genetics play a role in determining traits, environmental influences and personal experiences are equally significant in shaping personality. There’s contention about the balance between innate traits versus learned behaviors, with some arguing that it is overly simplistic to view personality changes purely as responses to environmental inputs without considering genetic predispositions.

A noteworthy point raised is the role of neuroplasticity, particularly during adolescence, where intense social interactions can lead to rapid personality adaptations. Discussions also touch on mental health, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and the potential benefits or drawbacks of various psychoactive substances, like psychedelics, in altering perceptions and behaviors.

There is a meta-discussion about the implications of these ideas for understanding mental health and behavior modification, along with a recognition that personality and identity are fluid constructs. Respondents express both skepticism and curiosity about how this understanding might influence broader societal contexts, including treatment methodologies for mental health issues.

Overall, the conversation demonstrates a blend of skepticism, personal anecdotes, and serious contemplation regarding the interplay of genetics, environment, and individual agency in shaping one's personality over time.
