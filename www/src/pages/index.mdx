Researchers have been exploring ways to improve the efficiency of transformer models, which are widely used in natural language processing tasks. One approach involves replacing the exponential operation in the attention layer of the transformer with a linear operation. This allows for a recurrent reformulation of the model, reducing the computational cost from quadratic to linear on the length of the input. However, initial experiments showed that training large language models with linear transformers was slower compared to traditional transformers. A recent post on Hacker News challenges this notion and presents several different implementations of linear transformers that can achieve massive speed-ups. The experiments compare the speed and performance of different algorithms, including an optimized transformer, a straightforward recurrent implementation of the linear transformer, and an optimized linear transformer. The results show that the optimized linear transformer outperforms even the highly-optimized FlashAttention baseline in terms of training speed, especially for moderately large context sizes. However, it is noted that linear transformers can negatively affect learning as the sequence length grows, leading to degraded performance. The post concludes by mentioning that future posts will explore ways to improve the learning of linear transformers and enable the training of language models with super-fast sampling.

The discussion on this submission mainly revolves around the performance and potential drawbacks of linear transformers. Some users express skepticism about the claimed benefits of linear transformers and suggest that the author's results may be misleading.

In a recent experiment on Hacker News, user "aaa" tested the performance of ChatGPT-4 in solving problems from Advent of Code 2023. Advent of Code is an annual programming event that takes place during the first 25 days of December, where participants solve coding challenges for each day. 

ChatGPT, a language model, was pitted against Advent of Code, which has problems ranging from easy to moderately difficult. Previous iterations of ChatGPT had gained attention for their performance in the event, with users reaching the top of the global leaderboard. However, last year's results with GPT-3.5 were modest, struggling to solve problems past day 5.

The author chose Advent of Code as a benchmark because it provides a range of problems with increasing difficulty, making it a suitable test for AGI. All problems are solvable within a few hours, providing a benchmark for how well ChatGPT-4 performs.

Using the command line client, chatgpt-cli, the author manually ran ChatGPT's output programs based on the problem prompts. Prompting the model with a simplified version of the problem, the author fixed trivial syntax mistakes and gave up if a solution didn't terminate within 15 minutes. If the initial solution was incorrect, the author requested debug output from ChatGPT. The experiment was stopped after four consecutive days of ChatGPT's failure to solve part 1.

The results showed mixed performance from ChatGPT-4. It managed to solve some problems independently but struggled with others, requiring hints or assistance from ChatGPT Plus, a subscription-based version of the model. Additionally, the blog of another ChatGPT enthusiast provided insights into their efforts with ChatGPT Plus, but it often required baby-stepping the model to achieve results.

Comparing the performance of GPT-4 with the previous year's GPT-3.5, GPT-4 had a slightly worse performance. While GPT-3.5 could solve three days' problems independently, GPT-4 faced challenges as early as day 3.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around the performance of ChatGPT-4 in solving problems from Advent of Code. Some users argue that Advent of Code is not a perfect benchmark and suggest using alternative benchmarks like getting dependencies or benchmarking the ability to solve LeetCode challenges. Others express their personal experiences and opinions on the limitations and capabilities of language models like ChatGPT.

There is a debate on whether an average programmer can solve Advent of Code faster than GPT-4. Some users believe that the marginal utility of using GPT-4 may not necessarily improve performance significantly. Others argue that the performance depends on factors like syntax clarity, programming language choice, the quality of the code, and the hardware being used.

The discussion also touches upon the lack of debugging skills in ChatGPT and the need for human intervention in fixing bugs. Some users suggest that debugging capabilities should be added to language models. Others mention the importance of high-level languages and the limitations of current language models in understanding and improving code.

There are comments discussing the productivity of popular programming languages, the effectiveness of different debugging techniques, and the potential improvements that can be made in AI technology to complement developers' productivity.

### Escaping from isolated networks using Broadcast DNS

#### [Submission URL](https://medium.com/sensorfu/escaping-isolated-networks-using-broadcast-dns-5aee866bcaff) | 38 points | by [jviide](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jviide) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38997692)

Researchers at SensorFu have discovered a new method called "Broadcast DNS escape" that allows for the escape of isolated networks. By sending DNS queries via a broadcast ethernet packet, the researchers were able to redirect these queries to another network. This method has been proven effective in two real-world scenarios. In one instance, a Beacon deployed in a production network leaked because the isolated network containing the Beacon and the DNS resolvers were accidentally connected. In another case, a Beacon deployed in an isolated production network was connected to an IT network, allowing the broadcast DNS queries to escape. The researchers highlight that this method takes advantage of a weakness in TCP/IP network stacks, where the next layer of the stack may not recognize a broadcast packet and processes it anyway.

In the discussion about the broadcast DNS escape method, a user named "phyzm" expresses concern about the potential for DNS filtering capability and the possibility of a return channel. Another user named "hrrl" responds, thanking SensorFu for the discovery and explains that this technique takes advantage of the shortcomings in TCP/IP network stacks. They mention that the success of the method depends on the device's ability to process the broadcast packet and the specific configuration of DNS servers. 

Another user named "jstsmhngy" adds to the conversation, explaining that broadcast DNS packets are directed to the network's broadcast address in IPv4 networks, with the MAC address being the FFs. They mention that devices such as routers, switches, and load balancers in the network would process the DNS requests based on their configurations and requirements. They raise a question about whether individuals purposely configure devices in a way that allows these types of packets to pass through in production and industrial networks to facilitate troubleshooting or other purposes.

Overall, the discussion revolves around the technical aspects of the broadcast DNS escape method and the configurations of devices in different network settings.
