### Physics Informed Neural Networks

#### [Submission URL](https://nchagnet.pages.dev/blog/physics-informed-neural-networks/) | 78 points | by [nchagnet](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nchagnet) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43071775)

The application of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is creating a buzz in data science, particularly in the realm of physics. This innovative approach leverages the capabilities of neural networks to solve complex differential equations that govern actual physical systems. Unlike traditional supervised learning where models learn from labeled data, PINNs bypass the need for curated datasets. Instead, they utilize the differential equations themselves as loss functions, tuning the neural network parameters to capture the solution of these equations.

PINNs work by approximating solutions to differential equations through neural networks, which are excellent at representing complex functions. Throughout this process, the network is trained using randomly sampled points, optimizing to fit the differential equations' solutions. This method entails using the equation's residual to adjust the network parameters, transforming the solving of differential equations into a kind of optimization problem without needing explicit data labels.

An interesting aspect of PINNs is how they handle boundary conditions. For solving an equation like \( \mathcal{L}[y] = 0 \), boundary values are crucial to defining a unique solution. Solutions can either include these conditions as penalty terms in the loss function, making the network optimize for both the equation and its boundaries, or through clever parameterizations that inherently satisfy these conditions ‚Äî offering flexibility in how they can be modeled.

This approach is particularly useful because it overcomes some of the traditional challenges faced in solving differential equations numerically, providing a direct and often more efficient pathway to solutions without the overhead of data collection and preparation. By seamlessly integrating physical laws into the model training process, PINNs hold tremendous promise for advancing our ability to model and understand complex systems across various scientific and engineering disciplines.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) highlights both enthusiasm for their potential and skepticism about practical limitations. Key points include:

### **Applications and Benefits**  
- PINNs are seen as a *promising tool* for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), especially in scenarios where traditional numerical methods (e.g., finite element methods) are computationally prohibitive, such as high-dimensional problems or complex meshes.  
- They can generate **initial guesses** for classical solvers or act as mesh-free approximations where error tolerance is acceptable.  
- NVIDIA‚Äôs Modulus framework and open-source libraries (e.g., DeepXDE) demonstrate growing accessibility and real-world adoption.  

### **Critical Points**  
- **Hype vs. Reality:** Skepticism is raised about overhyped LinkedIn/ML Influencer content ("GIF MLP PINN"), with concerns that PINNs may not yet live up to social media buzz.  
- **Technical Limitations:**  
  - PINNs often require *problem-specific training*, limiting generalization across PDE types, boundary conditions, or domains.  
  - Results are typically **less accurate** and **slower to train** compared to classical solvers.  
  - Neural network gradients may poorly approximate true gradients, risking unstable or unreliable solutions.  

### **Challenges**  
- **Trade-offs:** While cheaper for certain problems, training loops and network parameterization costs may offset savings versus classical methods.  
- **Research Gaps:** Inverse problems (e.g., estimating parameters from experimental data) and training robustness remain active areas for improvement.  

### **Conclusion**  
PINNs represent an exciting but immature field. They excel in niche applications (e.g., rapid prototyping, avoiding meshing) but face hurdles in accuracy, speed, and generality. Commentators stress the importance of leveraging PINNs as **complements**, not replacements, for classical solvers, with optimism for future advancements.

### AI is stifling new tech adoption?

#### [Submission URL](https://vale.rocks/posts/ai-is-stifling-tech-adoption) | 471 points | by [kiyanwang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kiyanwang) | [410 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43047792)

In a compelling analysis on Hacker News, the author reflects on the deep influence AI models have on developers' technology choices. As AI tools become integral in developers' workflows, they're shaping decisions not merely on merit but on the AI's ability to support certain technologies. This influence springs from AI training data cutoffs, which create a knowledge gap where new technologies aren't supported until well after their release. Consequently, developers may shy away from these novel options, opting instead for those with robust AI support, which could hinder the adoption of innovative and potentially superior tools.

A prevalent issue is that these language models are trained on massive datasets that become outdated, impacting their guidance on cutting-edge technologies. This situation creates an inverse feedback loop where the lack of immediate AI-generated support keeps new technologies from reaching critical adoption mass, thus limiting the production of new material for AI models to learn from. This eventually reinforces the preference for older, established technologies.

Moreover, anecdotal evidence suggests a systemic bias within AI tools, with certain platforms like Claude often defaulting to technologies like React and Tailwind, despite user preferences for alternatives such as vanilla HTML/CSS/JS. This inclination underlines the notion that AI assistants may push developers towards specific, perhaps overused, technologies dictated by internal, unpublished prompts. Such behavior not only amplifies existing technology biases but could also subtly standardize them across the development community.

The discussion suggests a necessary examination of how AI influences development practices and highlights the need for transparency and updates in AI training. Otherwise, innovation risks being stifled by AI's propensity to favor existing technologies at the expense of new, potentially groundbreaking alternatives.

### Evaluating RAG for large scale codebases

#### [Submission URL](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/evaluating-rag-for-large-scale-codebases/) | 39 points | by [GavCo](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GavCo) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43046170)

In his latest post, Assaf Pinhasi delves into the intricacies of evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems tailored for extensive codebases, particularly in enterprise settings. This exploration is crucial for enhancing generative AI coding assistants, which rely on RAG for context-sensitive code completion and quality improvement.

Facing unique challenges, Pinhasi outlines an evaluation framework that ensures accuracy and completeness in RAG outputs. The evaluation tackles what, when, and how to assess the results of RAG systems. Key outputs, like retrieved documents and final generated content, were chosen to maintain focus on user experience and consistency across system updates.

Evaluating 'what' involves selecting outputs related to user satisfaction, such as answer correctness and retrieval accuracy. For 'when', a tiered approach is used, from frequent local tests during development to comprehensive checks before major releases.

The 'how' of evaluating, particularly the correctness of answers, leverages a novel method called "LLM-as-a-judge." This involves using large language models (LLMs) to evaluate the accuracy of outputs since they understand and can verify language naturally.

However, RAG systems pose a challenge because they rely on private data, which LLMs might not have trained on. Thus, human domain experts create a ground-truth dataset against which LLMs can measure output accuracy, providing a scalable yet reliable evaluation method.

In designing the evaluation dataset, Pinhasi emphasizes diversity and realistic conditions, drawing from large commercial codebases across different repositories and programming languages. This comprehensive framework offers valuable insights for developing dependable and efficient RAG systems in complex environments.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the use of LLMs as judges in evaluating RAG systems, with mixed perspectives on reliability and practicality:  

1. **LLMs as Self-Judges**:  
   - **Criticism**: Users like *jmmnyx* and *ptsrgnt* liken LLMs grading their own outputs to "students grading their homework," raising concerns about bias and accuracy. LLMs may favor their own generated answers, leading to self-reinforcing errors.  
   - **Counterpoints**: *dnfnty* argues that self-review (even if imperfect) can save time and streamline workflows, similar to code reviews in software development.  

2. **Practical Challenges**:  
   - *tnc* compares LLM-as-judge to teaching assistants grading exams, noting issues with answer alignment (e.g., mismatched solutions).  
   - *ptsrgnt* emphasizes the need for human cross-checks, as LLMs might miss nuanced errors or propagate biases from their training data.  

3. **Legal and Ethical Risks**:  
   - A sub-thread involving *prcryt* warns that over-reliance on LLM judgments in sensitive contexts (e.g., legal) could pose risks if outputs are flawed or misrepresented as "truth."  

4. **Workflow Integration**:  
   - *33a* points out that self-evaluation is already a natural part of RAG systems, while *nmnyyg* and *mrkrsn* highlight concerns about data ownership and transparency when using customer data for training.  

**Key Takeaway**: While LLMs offer efficiency gains, skepticism persists about their objectivity, especially in high-stakes scenarios. Human oversight and diverse evaluation methods remain critical.

As AI continues to evolve, organizations are urged to engage in dialogue and develop strategies to navigate this technological frontier responsibly.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around skepticism toward AI's ability to replace human judgment in legal contexts, emphasizing the need for oversight and ethical considerations. Key points include:

1. **Limitations of AI in Legal Interpretation**:  
   - Users argue that law cannot be reduced to formal proofs or mathematical systems, as it requires contextual, case-by-case interpretation. Judges‚Äô decisions often rely on reasoning and precedent, not rigid logic, making AI tools like LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) ill-suited for nuanced legal tasks.  
   - Concerns are raised about AI misinterpreting laws or generating incorrect legal text, necessitating human verification. One user notes that even if AI drafts summaries or translations, humans must closely review outputs to avoid errors.

2. **Human Oversight and Workflow Integration**:  
   - Suggestions include using AI for preliminary tasks (e.g., drafting emails, bullet points, or case summaries) but ensuring human experts review and refine outputs. Some propose hybrid workflows where AI assists with repetitive tasks but does not replace critical human roles.  
   - Criticisms highlight risks of over-reliance on AI, such as reduced accountability if errors occur or if legal professionals blindly trust AI-generated content.

3. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**:  
   - The UK Information Commissioner‚Äôs Office warns against outright AI bans, urging organizations to adopt tools compliant with data protection laws. However, debates arise about the legality of AI-generated legal advice and the need for clear regulations.  
   - Privacy issues are flagged, with users questioning how firms monitor employee AI usage without infringing on individual rights, especially in international contexts with varying data laws.

4. **Practical Use Cases and Pitfalls**:  
   - Examples include using LLMs to draft correspondence or condense legal texts, but users caution that outputs often lack precision. One commenter humorously suggests AI could automate "rubber-stamp" quality checks, but others stress that meaningful legal work requires human expertise.  
   - A linked article criticizes AI-generated news summaries for inaccuracies, underscoring broader reliability concerns.

**Conclusion**: While AI holds potential for efficiency gains, the consensus leans toward cautious, regulated adoption in law, prioritizing human judgment, transparency, and ethical safeguards.

### The demise of software engineers due to AI is greatly exaggerated

#### [Submission URL](https://techleader.pro/a/679-The-demise-of-software-engineers-due-to-AI-is-greatly-exaggerated-(TLP-2025w6)) | 51 points | by [saltysalt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=saltysalt) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43043262)

In a lively article by John Collins, published on February 10, 2025, the notion that AI is set to replace software engineers is critically examined and deemed overhyped. Collins delves into a recent leadership workshop where senior executives were buzzing with the idea of AI eradicating the need for expensive software engineers‚Äîechoing Salesforce's decision to halt new engineering hires in 2025. Yet, Collins remains skeptical, advocating for a reality check based on hands-on experiences from his engineering team.

His team's use of tools like Github Copilot paints a nuanced picture. While AI-powered features such as code auto-completion have proven beneficial for productivity by handling small code snippets, broader applications in feature development remain unreliable. Instead of supplanting engineers, AI assists like Copilot function more like junior team members, demonstrating there is no imminent replacement for the multi-faceted roles engineers play‚Äîtasks encompassing stakeholder management, debugging, design, and more.

Tackling the broader industry sentiment, Collins suggests that many non-tech companies harbinger hopes of cutting costs by reducing their engineering workforce; a narrative not matching the current capabilities of AI. In a witty conclusion, Collins maintains that while AI in its current form serves as a useful tool, it falls short of fulfilling the comprehensive and dynamic responsibilities entrusted to experienced engineers. For 2025, he's still hiring and enthusiastically highlights the human touch that can't yet be outsourced to algorithms. 

Explore more in Collins' new blog, "We are all just shouting at avatars," and tune into his podcast for further insights, available on popular streaming platforms.
