### To Make Language Models Work Better, Researchers Sidestep Language

#### [Submission URL](https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-make-language-models-work-better-researchers-sidestep-language-20250414/) | 24 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43744809)

In Anil Ananthaswamy's recent article for Quanta Magazine, researchers are exploring new ways to enhance the efficiency of large language models (LLMs) by sidestepping their reliance on language. Traditionally, LLMs, like those using transformers, process information by translating mathematical representations into words. This requirement to verbalize concepts can slow down processing and lead to potential information loss.

The core of an LLM's function occurs in a mathematical realm known as "latent space," where complex number sequences are manipulated to understand and generate text. However, translating these numerical computations into words demands extra computational resources and can act as a bottleneck, limiting the model's efficiency.

Two recent studies, highlighted by Mike Knoop and Luke Zettlemoyer, point towards innovative LLM architectures that allow models to maintain thought processes within latent space more extensively before producing text. This method has shown potential for both increased efficiency and improved reasoning capabilities.

In essence, these advancements seek to minimize the frequent conversions between latent computations and language expressions, a process that often involves creating a "chain of thought" or a token sequence mimicking thought processes. By allowing more reasoning to remain within the mathematical domain, researchers like Shibo Hao at the University of California, San Diego, are paving the way for a new era of AI—one less constrained by verbalization hurdles, potentially transforming the landscape of natural language processing.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the inefficiency of traditional LLMs compared to human reasoning and explores technical alternatives to mitigate these issues. Key points include:

1. **Human vs. LLM Reasoning**:  
   Humans solve problems through relatively simple, iterative reasoning steps, while LLMs require billions of parameters to mimic even basic reasoning. This highlights a gap in efficiency and elegance between biological and artificial intelligence.

2. **Chain of Thought Limitations**:  
   The "chain of thought" approach, which converts internal reasoning into tokenized outputs, risks information loss due to frequent translations between latent computations and language. This bottleneck underscores the need for alternative architectures.

3. **Latent Space Retention with Recurrent Networks**:  
   Recurrent networks are proposed as a way to keep reasoning within the mathematical "latent space" longer, reducing reliance on token generation. This aligns with research aiming to enhance LLMs by minimizing lossy conversions to text.

4. **Flow Matching & Iterative Processes**:  
   The discussion highlights "flow matching," an iterative method likened to solving differential equations step-by-step. Instead of generating tokens at each step, models update latent vectors incrementally (e.g., predicting 𝑥₀, an initial state, directly). This approach mirrors how recurrent networks process sequences and could streamline reasoning by avoiding intermediate verbalizations.

5. **Transformers in Latent Space**:  
   Techniques like integrating Gaussian noise into transformers’ latent space processing are mentioned. This allows models to predict outcomes (e.g., 𝑥₀) directly within the latent domain, bypassing repetitive token generation and improving computational efficiency.

**Takeaway**: The conversation emphasizes the potential of recurrent architectures and latent-space-focused methods (like flow matching) to enhance LLM efficiency and reasoning by reducing dependency on text-based intermediate steps, drawing parallels to both mathematical problem-solving and human cognition.

### Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video Generation

#### [Submission URL](https://lllyasviel.github.io/frame_pack_gitpage/) | 265 points | by [GaggiX](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=GaggiX) | [27 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43736193)

In a groundbreaking development from Stanford University, researchers Lvmin Zhang and Maneesh Agrawala have introduced an innovative approach to video generation by redefining next-frame prediction models. Their paper, titled "Packing Input Frame Context in Next-Frame Prediction Models for Video Generation," showcases a method called FramePack that revolutionizes how frames are processed and predicted.

Using this new technique, they demonstrate that video can be generated at full 30 frames-per-second using just a 6GB laptop GPU, which is a remarkable feat considering the usually high computational demands of video generation. This is accomplished by finely tuning large 13 billion parameter video models on nodes equipped with powerful GPUs like the A100 or H100, but also keeping it accessible enough to be run on personal systems like an RTX 4090.

FramePack shines by changing how input frames are encoded and managed, allowing important frames to receive more computational attention. This approach can greatly reduce computational complexity to constant time (O(1)), making streaming more efficient. The introduction of different patchifying kernels allows for adjusting context length per frame, optimizing the processing of each frame based on its importance.

The paper also tackles a common video generation issue known as "drifting," where quality degrades over time due to error accumulation. The researchers solved this by developing bi-directional sampling methods, which effectively break the causality that usually leads to these degradations.

Their experiments, carried out on everyday hardware like the RTX 3060, demonstrate impressive results with videos maintaining high quality over extended durations. This breakthrough in video generation holds promise for making high-quality video synthesis more accessible and efficient, with applications potentially spanning from personal creative projects to large-scale lab experiments.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on FramePack Video Generation Paper:**

Some note parallels to **ControlNet**, but FramePack’s ability to handle long-form video (1+ minutes vs. shorter clips in LTX-Video) stands out.

2. **Comparisons to Existing Models:**  
   Debates arise over **Hunyuan DiT** and **LTX-Video** (noted for speed but lower quality). Users criticize models like WAN-21 for "content drift" (quality drops after ~5 seconds), while praising FramePack’s stability. LTX-Video’s open-source implementation is acknowledged as a fast, distilled alternative.

3. **Corporate vs. Open-Source Dynamics:**  
   Skepticism surfaces about potential corporate influence on research, with users speculating whether contributors like **IC-Light** or Stanford researchers might face commercialization pressures. However, the availability of code and prompts in the paper is seen as a positive step toward transparency.

4. **Practicality for Users:**  
   Mixed reactions on real-world usability: Some question the need for high-end GPUs (e.g., RTX 5090), while others celebrate democratizing video synthesis. The integration of **Vision-LLMs** into workflows (e.g., ComfyUI) is flagged as a promising direction.

5. **Humorous Takes & Pop Culture:**  
   Lighthearted jokes dominate threads about the paper’s example outputs (e.g., people dancing inexplicably), with references to AI-generated "Safety Dance" memes. Users humorously debate whether prompts like "make it dance" are overused.

6. **Challenges & Limitations:**  
   Discussions touch on lingering issues like model size (14B parameters) and training data sources (jokes about TikTok datasets). Questions remain about generalizability to non-dance motions and reliance on specific prompting strategies.

**Key Takeaway:**

### The Web Is Broken – Botnet Part 2

#### [Submission URL](https://jan.wildeboer.net/2025/04/Web-is-Broken-Botnet-Part-2/) | 378 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [235 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43738603)

In a thought-provoking blog post, Jan Wildeboer, a tech evangelist and societal hacker, unveils the murky underbelly of AI-driven data collection. Wildeboer spotlights a troubling trend: AI companies aggressively scraping data from the internet, often by surreptitiously using botnets created through third-party app SDKs. These SDKs, like Infatica, enable app developers to sell network bandwidth from unsuspecting users, essentially turning their devices into parts of a widespread botnet. This predatory practice results in surges of bot traffic that overwhelm smaller servers and contribute to an alarming rise in DDoS-like web crawler attacks.

Wildeboer argues that this shady business model, which repurposes residential and mobile IPs for concealed scraping activities, should be outright banned. He urges tech giants like Apple, Microsoft, and Google to take action against these practices and holds app developers accountable for their complicity in spreading what he considers to be a form of malware.

This exposé doesn't just reveal the exploitative tactics in the proxy business but also critiques the AI hype as a catalyst for this behavior, which is eroding the integrity of the web. Wildeboer’s analysis serves as a wake-up call for developers and webmasters to tighten security and scrutinize the SDKs they integrate into their applications.

For readers eager to delve deeper, Wildeboer provides links to reviews of residential proxy providers, painting a vivid picture of a burgeoning and nefarious market driven by AI's insatiable hunger for data. The call to action is clear: scrutinize, block, and advocate for a cleaner, more ethical internet.

The Hacker News discussion on Jan Wildeboer's exposé about AI-driven data scraping reveals a mix of technical countermeasures, debates over the ethics of web scraping, and calls for systemic solutions. Participants highlighted methods to combat malicious traffic, such as blocking requests from outdated user-agent strings (e.g., old Chrome versions) and filtering traffic by ASN (Autonomous System Number) ranges. Tools like **Anubis**—a reverse proxy that enforces client-side proof-of-work challenges—were proposed to throttle abusive bots while allowing legitimate crawlers. Others suggested using commercial services like IPinfo to detect and block residential proxy IPs.  

A key debate centered on whether web scraping is inherently harmful or a necessary tool for services like search engines, the Internet Archive, and public data projects. While some criticized AI companies for normalizing predatory scraping (e.g., overwhelming servers with DDoS-like traffic), others defended scraping’s role in enabling open access to information.  

Technical solutions proposed included:  
- **Cryptographic verification** (e.g., crawlers signing requests with domain-specific keys).  
- **Proof-of-work mechanisms** to deter large-scale automation, though concerns were raised about their environmental and user-experience costs.  
- Financial disincentives for abusive actors, such as penalizing entities profiting from unauthorized data extraction.  

Critiques of CAPTCHAs highlighted their inefficiency, with suggestions to replace them with less intrusive methods. Broader systemic fixes involved rethinking web architecture (e.g., encrypted client hello protocols) or regulatory measures to hold AI companies accountable.  

The discussion underscored the challenge of distinguishing malicious bots from legitimate traffic, with participants split on whether aggressive filtering might harm beneficial scraping. Overall, the call to action emphasized tighter SDK scrutiny, developer accountability, and a reevaluation of AI’s role in incentivizing unethical data practices. The tension between preserving an open web and curbing exploitation remains unresolved, but technical innovation and policy shifts were seen as critical paths forward.

### Frankenstein's `__init__`

#### [Submission URL](https://ohadravid.github.io/posts/2025-04-19-frank/) | 95 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [66 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43735724)

In the labyrinthine world of Python programming, a recent tale from April 19, 2025, takes the cake for revealing a mind-boggling use of `__init__` methods. Picture this: a developer, trying to unravel why a seemingly straightforward test for a Python service fails unpredictably, stumbles upon a jaw-dropping discovery.

The test began as a simple function, yet occasionally threw a wrench into the works with an unexpected `AttributeError`. The culprit seemed elusive until a deep dive into the code's intricacies revealed a startling finding: the class `FooBarWidget`, derived from `FooWidget`, was harboring a dastardly `__init__`.

In an unconventional twist, the `FooBarWidget` class initiates its parent class’s `__init__` method in a separate thread. This maneuver was aimed to circumvent ZeroMQ's restrictions on moving sockets between threads. However, if the `FooBarWidget` was closed prematurely, it risked doing so before its parent’s initialization was complete—leading to chaos.

The designer’s motivation here stemmed from a desire to keep the main thread unblocked while handling ZeroMQ's threading limitations. Though innovative, this approach threw caution—and perhaps reason—to the wind, creating a debugging nightmare.

This peculiar coding choice reminds one of the timeless narrative of Frankenstein—breathless horror mingling with the past dreams of boundless creation. If you found this journey through Python madness captivating, you might enjoy diving into tales of StackOverflow downvotes or accelerating Python with Rust.

The full code serves as a testament to the extremes developers may venture and the complexity they can incur in the pursuit of problem-solving.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around best practices for object initialization and resource management in Python, sparked by a submission about a developer’s debugging nightmare caused by a complex `__init__` method. Key points include:

1. **Dangers of Complex Constructors**:  
   Users highlight the risks of overloading `__init__` with operations like network calls or file I/O, which can lead to half-initialized objects and unpredictable errors. Python’s lack of strict enforcement for fully initialized objects exacerbates this, especially when external resources (e.g., database connections) are involved.

2. **Resource Management Alternatives**:  
   - **Context Managers**: Praised as a Pythonic way to handle resources (via `__enter__`/`__exit__`), ensuring cleanup even if errors occur.  
   - **Factory Methods/Builder Patterns**: Suggested to decouple object creation from initialization. For example, using `@classmethod` to parse configurations before invoking `__init__`, avoiding side effects during construction.  

3. **Language Comparisons**:  
   - **Rust/C#**: Users admire Rust’s `Result` type and strict constructor semantics, where fallible initialization is explicit. C#’s approach to separating sync/async resource acquisition is also noted as cleaner.  
   - **Critique of Python**: Flexibility in `__init__` is seen as a double-edged sword, leading to fragile code compared to languages enforcing RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization).

4. **Inheritance vs. Composition**:  
   Deep inheritance hierarchies are criticized for complexity. Traits, protocols, and composition (via abstract base classes or Python’s `Protocol`) are advocated as alternatives to achieve reusable behavior without tight coupling. Rust’s trait system is cited as an ideal model.

5. **Error Handling and Explicit Design**:  
   Users stress the importance of failing fast and using static factory methods for validation before object creation. The discussion leans toward explicit, two-step initialization (e.g., `create()` + `__init__`) over “magic” in constructors.

### Takeaways:  
The community emphasizes simplicity in `__init__`, leveraging Python’s context managers for resources, and adopting patterns like factories or protocols to reduce fragility. Comparisons with stricter languages underscore a desire for clearer error handling and resource lifecycle management in Python.

### Ultrathink is a Claude Code a magic word

#### [Submission URL](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Apr/19/claude-code-best-practices/) | 106 points | by [ghuntley](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=ghuntley) | [38 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739997)

Simon Willison's latest blog post delves into the newly released documentation from Anthropic, which details the best practices for using their Claude Code CLI tool. A particularly intriguing tip is the strategic use of the word "think" to enhance the tool's processing capabilities. Users can escalate the tool's computational intensity by issuing commands like "think," "think hard," "think harder," and "ultrathink," each progressively increasing the system's "thinking budget."

Curious as to whether this feature was inherent to the Claude model or exclusive to Claude Code, Simon explored the codebase, employing some nifty JavaScript deobfuscation techniques. Through these methods, he confirmed that the terms are indeed mapped to different computational budgets, with "ultrathink" being the highest, allowing a whopping 31,999 tokens. Lesser commands like "megathink" afford 10,000 tokens, while just "think" offers 4,000 tokens.

This exploration not only unveils a hidden but fascinating facet of Claude Code but also exemplifies how even non-open-source tools can often be understood and dissected to reveal their inner workings. If you're a coder or AI enthusiast interested in leveraging your tools to their fullest potential, this is a read you won't want to miss!

The Hacker News discussion on Simon Willison's exploration of Anthropic's Claude Code CLI reveals several key insights and reactions:

1. **"Think" Commands Confirmed as Hard-Coded**  
   Users confirmed that terms like "think," "think harder," and "ultrathink" are explicitly mapped to increasing token budgets (up to 31,999 tokens for "ultrathink") in the CLI tool, not the underlying model. Simon Willison shared deobfuscated code snippets to demonstrate this hard-coded behavior.

2. **Transparency and Model Behavior Concerns**  
   Some users expressed frustration over the lack of explicit documentation for computational budgets, questioning why terms like "ultrathink" are used instead of numerical parameters. Others speculated about shifting model behavior over time, possibly due to silent updates from Anthropic.

3. **LLM Limitations in Technical Contexts**  
   A user shared frustrations with Gemini 25 Pro providing confidently incorrect instructions for Blender and Photoshop, highlighting LLMs' tendency to hallucinate when lacking specific UI/software documentation. Willison noted that LLMs aren’t trained on GUI tool manuals, leading to unreliable answers for niche technical workflows.

4. **Humor and Cultural References**  
   Comments included jokes about "magic spells" (e.g., "megathink," "Hyperthink"), references to *Babylon 5*, and Japanese folklore (*Tengu*), adding levity to the technical discussion.

5. **Comparisons and Alternatives**  
   Users debated Claude’s value compared to competitors like Gemini 25 (noting its lower cost) and mused about reverse-engineering other "magic keywords" in AI tools.

**Takeaway**: The discussion underscores both curiosity about hidden CLI features and skepticism toward LLMs’ reliability in specialized domains, balanced with humor and cultural nods.

### Ansible: Pure (only in its) pragmatism

#### [Submission URL](https://andrejradovic.com/blog/ansible/) | 14 points | by [cue_the_strings](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=cue_the_strings) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43739391)

In a world brimming with opinions and technical allegiances, Ansible often finds itself on the receiving end of some undeserved criticism. For nearly a decade, I've been navigating Ansible's waters, gaining firsthand insight into its strengths and growing pains. It's time we take an objective look at what Ansible brings to the table—and the intricacies that sometimes trip up even the most seasoned users.

At its core, Ansible is a Swiss Army knife for systems administration, designed to put machines into a desired state, emphasizing idempotence through SSH or WinRM. Like a magician, Ansible can enforce system settings—be it folder permissions or firewall rules—only making modifications when necessary. This approach champions stability and predictability, hallmarks of good configuration management.

Harnessing the power of YAML and Jinja2, Ansible offers a canvas for crafting reusable, manageable, and scalable code. Its prolific community and Ansible Galaxy supercharge its utility, providing a wealth of plugins and roles to tap into. You can effortlessly integrate with external services or deploy automation across operating systems thanks to its expansive ecosystem.

However, Ansible is not without its quirks. Its insistence on structured file hierarchies for playbooks, inventories, and roles can perplex newcomers, at least until they familiarize themselves with the documentation. Ansible's simplicity, heralded by its champions, can sometimes manifest as constraints—global variables and naming conventions being chief among them.

Drama aside, Ansible isn't pure in its declarative intentions. Indeed, the sequence of tasks matters, reminiscent of stringing shell scripts together—albeit with more finesse and less chaos. While purists might scoff at this, Ansible serves as a robust, reliable alternative to hand-crafted SSH scripts, boasting mature idempotence and a dependable track record that supports professional credibility.

So, is Ansible the perfect tool? Far from it. But in a landscape where deployment shell scripts fall short, Ansible embraces its pragmatic simplicity. Its imperfections are part of its charm—yet its ability to reliably manage and orchestrate complex environments casts it as a hero of the practicality over perfection narrative, giving professionals the confidence to include it on their resumes and trusting it with their operational tasks.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around several challenges and pain points experienced by Ansible users, alongside suggested workarounds:

1. **Complexity and Structural Issues**:  
   Users criticize Ansible's YAML-driven playbook structure and rigid hierarchies, which can confuse newcomers. Specific frustrations include limited task feedback mechanisms, challenges in handling conditional logic, and difficulties managing error scenarios (e.g., checking if a file exists before executing tasks). These limitations often lead to overly complex, nested playbooks over time, with some users deeming Ansible "too cumbersome" for advanced use cases.

2. **Python Dependency Headaches**:  
   A recurring issue is Ansible’s reliance on specific Python versions/modules on target hosts, particularly problematic when deploying to systems without pre-installed dependencies (e.g., the `postgresql_user` module requiring `psycopg2`). This forces workarounds like virtual environments or containerized execution environments (EEs). Red Hat Enterprise Linux (EL8) users highlight compatibility woes, as newer Ansible versions struggle with older Python runtimes (e.g., Python 3.6), sparking frustration over Red Hat’s support lifecycle.

3. **Performance and Installation Debates**:  
   The SSH-based execution model is noted for sluggishness, especially with large inventories. Users debate installation methods—preferring `pipx` for isolation over system packages—and advocate for containerization (Podman/Docker) to sidestep dependency clashes. Some suggest Ansible’s controller-centric design offloads complexity but complicates target host setups.

**Community Solutions**:  
While critical, the discussion offers pragmatic fixes: EEs streamline Python dependencies, containers abstract runtime issues, and tools like AWX/AAP (Ansible Tower) provide scalability. However, these add layers of complexity, underscoring Ansible’s trade-offs between simplicity and real-world adaptability. The tone reflects a resigned acceptance of Ansible’s quirks, balancing its utility against unavoidable friction in heterogeneous environments.

### Ink and Switch Constraint System (2023)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.inkandswitch.com/ink/notes/phase-2-constraint-system/) | 87 points | by [mpweiher](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mpweiher) | [13 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729932)

In the ever-evolving world of computational models, the dynamic medium of constraint systems is taking center stage, particularly in the innovative project relax-pk. This initiative, unfolding in the fall of 2023, is addressing the notoriously difficult task of implementing reliable and effective constraint systems, a venture with the potential to revolutionize how algorithms interact with mechanical constructions and computational models alike.

At the outset of phase 2, uncertainty loomed over how to best harness constraints, as they have historically been plagued by issues like "floaty-ness," where parameter changes cause unrealistic drifts, and "blow-ups," which result in system instability. However, early optimism has led to breakthroughs that promise to overcome these challenges. By reducing the dimensionality of problems and employing techniques like clustering, which segments constraints into smaller, independently solvable clusters, they’ve paved the way for more efficient and stable solutions.

The efforts have already yielded tangible results, such as eliminating the disorienting effects of duplicate states and preventing system "blow-ups" even when constraints are unevenly applied. Another exciting development is their successful use of equality constraints to simplify the solver’s workload. For example, they cleverly handle duplicate variables—like angle constraints presented in both radians and degrees—by collapsing them to a single variable internally, thus smoothing out the computational process.

Moreover, by tapping into different solvers, such as relaxation-based and gradient descent-based approaches, and reframing value representation from cartesian to polar coordinates, performance and convergence have seen significant enhancements. This is pushing the boundaries toward a future where constraint systems not only simulate real-world mechanics more accurately but also open up new possibilities for interactive and responsive computational models.

With potential advancements from community innovations like Avi Bryant's auto-diff and WebAssembly-powered solvers, relax-pk stands on the brink of bringing a new level of sophistication to how we conceive and interact with constraints. This heralds an exciting trajectory for dynamic media, where computational models become as intuitive and responsive as the physical world they emulate.

The Hacker News discussion around the relax-pk constraint-solving project highlights both enthusiasm for its potential and references to related tools and challenges. Key points include:

1. **Existing Tools & Comparisons**:  
   - Users mentioned lightweight CAD programs (e.g., SolveSpace, Dune 3D) and their inherent constraint solvers, noting their strengths but also scalability limitations in complex designs. Autodesk Inventor’s struggles with under-constrained sketches and stability in large-scale CAD systems were cited as examples of industry hurdles.

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - Under-constrained systems remain a persistent issue, requiring additional user input to resolve. Scaling to complex geometries or dense constraints often leads to instability or slow performance.

3. **Academic & Algorithmic Context**:  
   - The discussion referenced Knuth’s *TAOCP Volume 4* on constraint satisfaction and numerical optimization methods like BFGS (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno). Users analyzed relax-pk’s solver in relation to quasi-Newton methods, line-search strategies (e.g., Armijo backtracking), and code optimizations, comparing them to implementations in SciPy and academic literature (Nocedal & Wright’s *Numerical Optimization*).

4. **Related Projects**:  
   - Carbide 0, Automerge, and Ivan Sutherland’s pioneering Sketchpad were highlighted as inspirations. Ink & Switch’s "Fuzzy Constraints" blog post and experimental tools (Crosscut, Potluck) emphasized a focus on user experience and handcrafted software design.

5. **Community Sentiment**:  
   - Excitement exists for relax-pk’s approach, seen as part of a broader movement to improve computational modeling. However, users stressed the importance of balancing academic rigor with practical usability, warning against repeating past pitfalls in solver design.

Overall, the thread underscores both optimism for constraint-solving advancements and the complexity of marrying theoretical methods with real-world CAD and interactive tools.

### OpenAI's new reasoning AI models hallucinate more

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/18/openais-new-reasoning-ai-models-hallucinate-more/) | 114 points | by [almog](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=almog) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43732506)

OpenAI recently unveiled its latest reasoning AI models, o3 and o4-mini, which have set new benchmarks in terms of performance in coding and math tasks. However, the models are facing a significant challenge: increased hallucination rates. Hallucinations refer to the models fabricating information or outcomes, and unfortunately, o3 and o4-mini exhibit higher hallucination rates compared to their predecessors. The issue is pronounced, with o3 hallucinating responses to 33% of the questions on OpenAI's PersonQA benchmark and o4-mini faring worse at 48%.

This development is surprising and concerning, as newly developed models usually offer improvements over previous versions. Despite their superior capabilities in certain areas, o3 and o4-mini make more inaccurate claims alongside correct ones, a phenomenon exacerbated by their tendency to generate more claims overall. Testing by third-party AI research lab Transluce indicates that o3 even fabricates processes, such as pretending to execute code on a device it doesn't have access to.

The implications of these findings are profound, especially in industries where precision is vital. While the creative aspects of hallucinations might be seen as innovative thinking, they can render models unreliable for sectors like law, where facts are non-negotiable. One proposed solution to tackle hallucination rates involves enhancing models with web search capabilities, which has proven effective with OpenAI’s GPT-4o, achieving higher accuracy on some benchmarks.

The increase in hallucinations reflects a broader challenge within the AI industry as it increasingly pivots towards reasoning models, which are supposed to offer better performance without extensive computing resources. Yet, as OpenAI's spokesperson Niko Felix emphasizes, reducing hallucinations remains a priority in their ongoing research to improve model accuracy and reliability.

The issue highlights the urgent need for solutions as the industry continues to strive for models that are not only intelligent but also trustworthy.

The Hacker News discussion on OpenAI's new models (o3 and o4-mini) and their hallucination issues highlights several key themes:

### **Examples of Hallucinations**
- Users shared instances where the models fabricated details, such as inventing **EXIF metadata** (e.g., GPS coordinates, timestamps) for a photo analysis task, despite lacking access to the data. One user noted the model even pretended to execute code on a nonexistent device.
- **GPT-4** was criticized for citing irrelevant sources, like linking to a completely unrelated Stack Overflow post when answering a technical question.

### **Technical Analysis of Reasoning Flaws**
- Participants compared the models’ reasoning to **"plausible-sounding bullshit"**, where step-by-step logic appears coherent but leads to incorrect conclusions. This mirrors human tendencies to rationalize flawed reasoning.
- Some speculated that **token-based reasoning** (e.g., "confidence tokens" in model outputs) might create an illusion of validity, even when conclusions are unfounded.

### **Training and Reward Model Critiques**
- A recurring argument centered on **reinforcement learning (RL)** shortcomings. Users suggested reward functions prioritize "correct-sounding" answers over truthfulness, incentivizing confident but inaccurate responses.
- One user likened the issue to a **"Hamiltonian course"**—models optimize for high scores (user satisfaction) rather than factual accuracy.

### **User Experiences and Implications**
- Developers reported erratic behavior, such as ChatGPT suddenly recommending obscure JavaScript libraries (e.g., *Scrawl-canvas*) over standard tools, raising concerns about reliability in coding contexts.
- Hallucinations in **geolocation tasks** (e.g., guessing photo locations) highlighted risks in real-world applications, where models might ignore physical evidence (like EXIF data) in favor of speculative reasoning.

### **Proposed Solutions and Comparisons**
- **External verification** (e.g., web searches, as used in GPT-4o) and **improved training data** were suggested to ground outputs in reality.
- Some praised **Claude** and **DeepSeek-R1** for better reasoning transparency, hinting that models should "show their work" to allow users to validate logic.
- Calls for **truthfulness-focused reward models** and penalizing hallucinations during RL training emerged as a priority.

### **Broader Concerns**
- Users expressed frustration with **flip-flopping answers** and models mirroring user biases instead of adhering to facts. For example, a discussion about Raspberry Pi’s affordability led the model to contradict itself based on conversational context.
- Skepticism persists about whether current AI research prioritizes **"actual reasoning"** over superficial performance benchmarks.

In summary, the community underscores the tension between creativity and reliability in AI, advocating for structural changes in training paradigms and validation mechanisms to address hallucination risks.

### SDFs from Unoriented Point Clouds Using Neural Variational Heat Distances

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212) | 38 points | by [haxiomic](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=haxiomic) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43729063)

Today on Hacker News, an intriguing mathematical paper has surfaced that might just reshape our understanding of surface reconstruction technology. Presented by a team of researchers including Samuel Weidemaier and Martin Rumpf, the study introduces a fresh variational approach for generating neural Signed Distance Fields (SDFs) from unoriented point clouds, a common data form in 3D modeling.

Traditionally, distance computations on discrete surfaces utilize an eikonal equation. However, this paper shifts the paradigm by leveraging the heat method, a technique familiar in discrete surface processing, but new to the neural domain. This innovative approach leads to two convex optimization problems solved using neural networks. First, a neural approximation of the unsigned distance field's gradients is calculated using a strategically timed heat flow. This output then provides the basis for accurately computing the final SDF.

The researchers assert the well-posed nature of the underlying variational problems they're tackling. Through extensive numerical experiments, they demonstrated that this method not only achieves state-of-the-art surface reconstruction but also yields consistent SDF gradients. Impressively, the proposed framework's accuracy shows potential for solving partial differential equations on the zero-level surface—a mark of its precision and utility.

This 14-page paper, packed with figures and tables, crosses the fields of Numerical Analysis, Graphics, and Machine Learning. It's poised to enrich our computational toolbox, especially for those engaged in detailed 3D rendering and modeling tasks. Dive into the full paper on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11212) to explore this groundbreaking method further.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the neural SDF paper:

2. **AI Integration Strategies**:  
   - Debates emerge on vertical vs. horizontal AI integration. Sam Altman’s OpenAI strategy is cited, emphasizing persistent, personalized AI assistants tied to user accounts. Critics argue for open standards and interoperability, fearing platform lock-in akin to an "AI App Store."

3. **Privacy & Identity Management**:  
   - Concerns about LLMs accessing third-party services via OAuth and identity providers (e.g., Apple, Microsoft) are raised. Users stress the need for secure, bidirectional control over data access to prevent misuse.

4. **Discord’s Profitability**:  
   - Discord’s monetization and profitability are scrutinized. While some users doubt its profitability despite long-term subscriptions, others note it has raised $1B+ in funding and may prioritize growth over short-term profits. The relevance of profitability for startups is debated, with examples from Y Combinator companies showing acquisition as a common exit strategy.

5. **Startup Economics**:  
   - Broader discussions highlight the tension between growth and profitability in startups. Some argue profitability is critical for longevity, while others defend growth-focused models reliant on investor funding, citing examples like Discord’s delayed path to profitability.

Overall, the thread reflects skepticism about Kagi’s cost management, enthusiasm for open AI ecosystems, and mixed views on the viability of freemium models in tech.

### Viral ChatGPT trend is doing 'reverse location search' from photos

#### [Submission URL](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/17/the-latest-viral-chatgpt-trend-is-doing-reverse-location-search-from-photos/) | 104 points | by [jnord](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jnord) | [54 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43725648)

Amidst the rapid advancements in AI, a new trend is grabbing attention—and raising concerns—on social media: users employing ChatGPT's latest models, o3 and o4-mini, to deduce locations from photographs. These models boast advanced image-reasoning capabilities, enabling them to analyze and interpret photo elements in surprising detail. Armed with this technology, users are putting ChatGPT through its paces, asking it to identify cities, landmarks, and even specific establishments from subtle visual clues provided in images.

While this might sound like a fun game akin to "GeoGuessr," where players guess locations from Google Street View images, it introduces potential privacy issues. There’s a tangible risk of individuals being doxxed by others who could misuse the technology to trace origins of personal photos, such as those shared in Instagram Stories.

Despite the excitement surrounding the models’ abilities—often outperforming older versions—there are notable inaccuracies and failures. Nevertheless, their success in identifying a Williamsburg speakeasy, where an older model guessed incorrectly, underscores both the power and potential privacy pitfalls of such technology.

OpenAI responded to the arising privacy concerns, stating that the new models are designed to prohibit requests involving private information and that they actively monitor for misuse. While the models promise aid in accessibility and emergency response scenarios, the emerging capabilities call for a closer look at safeguarding privacy in the digital age.

The Hacker News discussion on AI models like ChatGPT deducing locations from photos highlights a mix of fascination with the technology's capabilities and significant privacy concerns. Key points from the conversation include:

1. **Capabilities and Use Cases**:  
   - Users noted the models' impressive ability to infer locations from subtle visual clues (e.g., traffic direction, language scripts, landmarks) and compared it to *GeoGuessr*. Some shared examples, such as identifying a Williamsburg speakeasy or European cities like Essen and Sheffield, showcasing the AI's potential for accessibility or investigative tasks.  
   - AI-generated images (e.g., via Midjourney) were discussed as sometimes embedding metadata or regional stylistic cues that could inadvertently leak location details.

2. **Privacy Concerns**:  
   - Many raised alarms about doxxing risks, especially if personal photos (e.g., Instagram Stories) are analyzed. Users debated whether stripping EXIF data or metadata is sufficient, with some arguing that AI can still infer locations from visual context alone.  
   - Skepticism emerged about OpenAI’s safeguards, with calls for stricter restrictions on models to prevent misuse. Others countered that privacy is increasingly unattainable online, urging individuals to avoid sharing sensitive photos altogether.

3. **Debates on AI Reasoning**:  
   - Participants questioned whether LLMs truly "reason" or merely generate plausible text through pattern recognition. Some argued that AI lacks human-like understanding, while others highlighted its utility despite limitations.  
   - Comparisons to human decision-making (e.g., sales processes) underscored debates about AI’s reliability and the ethics of deploying such tools.

4. **Inaccuracies and Limitations**:  
   - Users shared anecdotes of AI failures, such as misidentifying landmarks or struggling with cropped images. While the models occasionally outperformed older versions, their inconsistency was noted as a barrier to trustworthiness.  

5. **Policy and Safeguards**:  
   - Discussions touched on OpenAI’s response to privacy risks, including policies against private data extraction. Some advocated for open-source alternatives to ensure transparency, while others highlighted the costs and challenges of developing ethical AI.  

6. **Community Sentiment**:  
   - A divide existed between those embracing the technology’s potential (e.g., for archival or creative projects) and others prioritizing privacy. The conversation reflected broader tensions between innovation and ethical responsibility in AI development.  

Overall, the thread underscores the dual-edged nature of advancing AI: while powerful for tasks like location inference, it demands careful consideration of privacy, accuracy, and the ethical implications of widespread deployment.
