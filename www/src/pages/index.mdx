#### [Submission URL](https://blog.danslimmon.com/2019/07/15/do-nothing-scripting-the-key-to-gradual-automation/) | 162 points | by [tehnub](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tehnub) | [34 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42976698)

In the digital age, manual, repetitive tasks, or "slogs" as they’re coined, can sap the productivity of operations teams. Though some teams might dream of full automation, they often stall due to the perceived all-or-nothing nature of such projects. Enter the notion of "do-nothing scripting," a clever strategy to ease these mundane processes into the realm of automation bit by bit.

The concept of do-nothing scripting involves creating a script that maps out a cumbersome manual task, like provisioning user accounts, as discrete, manageable steps. Each step is encapsulated in a function—a simple script that prompts the user to perform each part of the task manually. While it doesn’t automate the process immediately, it creates an organized pathway toward eventual automation, ensuring no steps are misplaced or forgotten.

The real charm lies in its progressiveness: each step becomes a candidate for future automation. Over time, this incremental approach can build a robust library of automation scripts, minimizing toil gradually rather than in one monumental leap. The method transforms frustrating slogs into structured procedural flows, lowering the threshold for automation initiatives and making it easier for teams to focus their energies on more rewarding challenges.

Ultimately, do-nothing scripting shines as a strategic bridge between manual burden and automated efficiency, helping teams nudge their operating procedures from a time-consuming slog to an efficient sprint.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The Hacker News discussion on "do-nothing scripting" highlights its value as a low-effort gateway to automation, though with nuanced critiques and extensions. Key points include:  

1. **Incremental Adoption**: Commenters praised the approach for reducing the cognitive load of tackling manual processes. Scripting discrete steps (e.g., Jira workflows, SSH key provisioning) creates a clear roadmap for future automation while providing immediate documentation.  

2. **Tool Comparisons**: Some favored command-line scripts for transparency and repeatability over GUI tools. Others suggested Jupyter notebooks or Ansible playbooks as alternatives for structured workflows.  

3. **Critiques**: Criticisms centered on potential overhead (e.g., unnecessary scripts for tasks already solvable via tools like `github-keygen`) and security risks (e.g., blindly generating SSH keys via AI-generated scripts without human oversight).  

4. **Broader Insights**:  
   - **Documentation**: Scripts act as living checklists, aiding onboarding and process accountability.  
   - **GUIs as Bottlenecks**: Several users lamented the brittleness of automating GUI-driven tasks versus CLI-native workflows.  
   - **AI Integration**: An example of using ChatGPT to generate "do-nothing" steps raised debates about balancing automation speed with security best practices.  

5. **Related Work**: Links to prior discussions (3+ years old) show lasting interest in minimal automation strategies, alongside tools like Fabric and POSSE-inspired scripts.  

Ultimately, the method is seen as a pragmatic bridge from manual to automated work, though success hinges on avoiding over-engineering and prioritizing critical steps.

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/jeprinz/pantograph/blob/main/README.md) | 68 points | by [rybla](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rybla) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42975171)

In today's tech buzz, Hacker News is spotlighting Pantograph, a cutting-edge structure editor crafted by Jacob Prinz and Henry Blanchette. This intriguing tool, detailed in the POPL 2025 paper titled "Pantograph: A Fluid and Typed Structure Editor", is designed for more intuitive programming by operating directly on a typed syntax tree.

Traditional editors parse text before checking types, but Pantograph flips the script by allowing users to fill 'typed holes' within a syntax tree. This lets programmers manipulate complex expressions like lists with ease, simplifying edits that previously required arduous reconfigurations. A key feature is its 'tree selection' or 'zipper editing', which enhances typical structure editing by maintaining program grammars and, ideally, their types.

Pantograph also takes well-typed programming a step further by introducing a grammar of type diffs to handle how edits alter program types. It offers some automated fixes for type errors, yet wisely allows users to address certain issues later to preserve potentially useful code fragments.

This innovative system is poised to simplify functional programming and is now available for users to explore online. Whether you're a coding novice or a seasoned developer, Pantograph offers an exciting new approach to writing and editing code efficiently. For those eager to dive deeper into its functionalities or contribute to its development, the project's code is open-source and available for exploration on GitHub.

### The Age of Agent Experience

#### [Submission URL](https://stytch.com/blog/the-age-of-agent-experience/) | 98 points | by [bobfunk](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bobfunk) | [41 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42974429)

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape, AI agents like ChatGPT Operator and coding tools such as Devin are revolutionizing user interaction with apps by autonomously navigating interfaces, executing tasks, and making requests on users' behalf. This shift necessitates a new focus on designing the "Agent Experience" (AX), where autonomous agents become a primary audience requiring secure, transparent, and efficient handling of data and actions.

Julianna Lamb emphasizes the growing importance of AX alongside traditional User Experience (UX) and Developer Experience (DX). Just like UX reshaped how humans interface with technology and DX prioritized developer tools and APIs, AX addresses the needs of AI agents that increasingly perform tasks autonomously. This change is propelled by agents' enhanced capabilities due to advancements in large language models and multi-modal inputs, which imbue them with "agency" – the power to initiate actions and manage tasks independently.

To harness AI agents effectively, businesses must ensure robust systems for agent authentication and authorization, with OAuth being a powerful ally in this regard. OAuth allows secure, delegated access without sharing passwords, using access tokens, and defining specific scopes. This facilitates secure user consent and streamlined agent operations, which are paramount as agents take on more roles traditionally handled by users.

The shift towards AX requires investing in clean, well-defined APIs that provide agents with reliable access to the necessary functionalities. Easy onboarding, minimal friction, and efficient operations are key to maximizing both agent productivity and user satisfaction. In certain cases, such as high-stakes transactions, step-up authentication should be employed to ensure human oversight over crucial actions.

As agents increasingly handle product or platform interactions, companies offering open ecosystems with easy onboarding, open APIs, and secure authentication are set to excel, outpacing closed, vertically integrated systems. By ensuring a quality agent experience, businesses not only support AI-driven agents but enhance their overall offering for human users, driving wider adoption and satisfaction.

**Summary of Discussion:**  
The discussion revolves around the challenges and opportunities in designing for AI agents (Agent Experience or AX) as they interact with systems on users' behalf. Key themes include:  

1. **Authentication & Security**:  
   - **OAuth** is highlighted as a critical tool for secure agent authentication, enabling delegated access without password sharing. Users emphasize its role in tracking agent actions and revoking access if agents misbehave.  
   - **Step-up authentication** (e.g., requiring human approval for sensitive transactions) and **hardware-based security** (physical tokens, USB keys) are proposed for high-stakes actions, though some criticize these as cumbersome.  

2. **CAPTCHA Challenges**:  
   - Traditional CAPTCHAs are seen as ineffective against AI agents, which can solve them cheaply. Alternatives like behavioral analysis (e.g., mouse movement patterns, network signals) or phone-based verification are debated.  

3. **APIs vs. Screen-Scraping**:  
   - Participants advocate for **robust APIs** over screen-scraping, which is brittle and error-prone. Examples like Plaid’s transition from screen-scraping to OAuth in fintech illustrate this shift.  
   - Some argue UIs designed for humans force agents to rely on unreliable methods, leading to calls for standardized, agent-friendly APIs.  

4. **Economic Incentives & Ecosystems**:  
   - Open platforms with **agent-friendly APIs** are predicted to outperform closed systems. Amazon’s dominance is cited as a cautionary example, where prioritizing sales over UX leads to competitive challenges.  
   - Concerns about brands losing control in open ecosystems are balanced against the inevitability of agents reshaping markets.  

5. **Technical Hurdles**:  
   - Developers note the difficulty of creating agents that navigate human-centric UIs, citing Firefox extensions using LLMs that break when websites change.  
   - Proposals include **HATEOAS** (hypermedia APIs) for agent navigation and behavioral heuristics (e.g., timing, deterministic signals) to distinguish agents from humans.  

6. **Skepticism & Humor**:  
   - Some users question whether OAuth truly meets agent needs yet, pointing to evolving standards. Others joke about agents "working in corporate factories" or replacing humans entirely.  

**Takeaway**: The shift to AX requires rethinking authentication, API design, and security, with OAuth and open ecosystems poised to play central roles. However, technical and economic challenges persist, particularly in balancing automation with human oversight and adapting legacy systems for agents. The discussion reflects both optimism for AI-driven efficiency and skepticism about implementation hurdles.

### The New York Times Has Spent $10.8M in Its Legal Battle with OpenAI So Far

#### [Submission URL](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/new-york-times-legal-battle-openai-1236127637/) | 81 points | by [marban](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=marban) | [89 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42952306)

In a tug-of-war over the future of media content, some major publishers have opted to embrace AI, pocketing substantial payouts from OpenAI in exchange for allowing their content to fuel ChatGPT and similar technologies. This approach seems to offer a steady revenue stream as traditional internet advertising faces uncertainty. For instance, Dotdash Meredith reported an annual intake of $16 million from such a licensing deal, while News Corp has touted its agreement with OpenAI as transformative.

However, The New York Times has taken a defiant path, suing OpenAI and Microsoft for allegedly using its content without permission, arguing for compensation to the tune of billions for what they see as unlawful actions. This legal crusade has cost The Times a hefty $10.8 million in AI-related litigation expenses for 2024. Standing firm on their principles, The Times is positioned as one of the few publishers robust enough, buoyed by over 11 million subscribers, to confront tech titans in court.

OpenAI’s CEO, Sam Altman, has publicly disagreed with The Times’ severe stance, suggesting that their legal approach could place them on "the wrong side of history." As the tussle continues, it highlights a broader industry dilemma: how to balance the potential tech benefits with fair compensation for original content creators. Meanwhile, industry giants including Vogue's parent Condé Nast, Time magazine, and others have still chosen licensing agreements, which are designed for mutual benefit, albeit with renegotiation options in the near future.

The Hacker News discussion revolves around the legal and ethical implications of OpenAI using copyrighted content, particularly highlighted by *The New York Times* (NYT) lawsuit. Key arguments and themes include:

1. **Verbatim Reproduction & Copyright Infringement**:  
   - Participants debate whether ChatGPT’s ability to reproduce NYT articles verbatim—even with extensive "prompt engineering"—constitutes copyright violation. Examples cited include OpenAI’s use of 10,000 prompts to generate near-identical copies of NYT content, which critics argue demonstrates intentional infringement.  
   - **Counterarguments** suggest OpenAI’s model, like mathematical sequences (e.g., generating Pi digits), isn’t inherently infringing unless outputs directly replicate copyrighted works. However, others insist *exact reproductions*, even via tokenized data, violate copyright law regardless of technical methods.

2. **Technical vs. Legal Interpretations**:  
   - Disagreements arise over whether AI-generated outputs using tokenized training data are equivalent to direct copying. Some argue copyright law cares only about the end result (exact reproductions), not the process, while others claim algorithms transforming data into new outputs are distinct from traditional infringement.  
   - Analogies like sharing a Marvel movie via BitTorrent (clearly illegal) versus AI indirectly reconstructing content highlight tensions between intent and technical execution.

3. **Corporate Power Dynamics**:  
   - Critics argue corporations like OpenAI exploit copyrighted material at scale, contrasting with individual creators who face harsher scrutiny. The framing pits “production” (corporations monetizing AI) against “consumption” (individuals sharing content), with concerns that the legal system favors entities with resources.  
   - OpenAI’s dismissive stance toward NYT’s claims is seen as emblematic of tech giants undermining content creators’ rights.

4. **OpenAI’s Defense & Legal Strategy**:  
   - OpenAI’s argument that training on publicly available data is legitimate faces skepticism. Critics liken it to “IP laundering,” where copyrighted content is obscured through AI processes. Others question if prompt-based outputs absolve liability, especially when users deliberately extract paywalled articles.  
   - The NYT’s lawsuit hinges on proving OpenAI’s models were designed to replicate proprietary content, with evidence of systematic verbatim outputs strengthening their case.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores unresolved tensions between AI innovation and copyright enforcement, with participants split on whether existing laws adequately address AI’s unique challenges. While technical nuances complicate legal judgments, the NYT’s case highlights growing scrutiny over AI’s reliance on uncompensated copyrighted material.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/deepseek-research-suggests-huaweis-ascend-910c-delivers-60-percent-nvidia-h100-inference-performance) | 115 points | by [sien](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=sien) | [59 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42943906)

Amidst the ongoing semiconductor race, Huawei has upped its ante by unveiling the HiSilicon Ascend 910C, a revamped version of the Ascend 910 AI processor. Despite trailing behind Nvidia's H100 in raw performance, the 910C aims to reduce China's reliance on American GPUs and asserts an interesting value proposition in AI inference tasks, delivering about 60% of the performance of Nvidia's market-leading offering. 

DeepSeek's research reveals that with minor kernel optimizations, the 910C could significantly exceed expectations in inference performance, hinting at Huawei's evolving capabilities despite facing U.S. sanctions and limited TSMC process tech access. Through DeepSeek's PyTorch repository, engineers can transition from CUDA to CUNN with less hassle, facilitating Huawei's processor integration into existing AI workflows.

Though China still struggles in the training reliability sphere—where Nvidia leads due to its longstanding hardware-software ecosystem integration—the Ascend 910C showcases promise as a competitive option. However, experts argue that Huawei's infrastructure needs refinement to stand firm on a global footing, especially in the wake of more complex Transformer architectures in AI models.

In the bigger picture, Huawei and SMIC have progressed to match capabilities dating back to TSMC's 2019–2020 offerings. This iteration of Huawei's AI chip utilizes SMIC’s 2nd Generation 7nm-class N+2 process, invoking a sense of catching up despite lagging behind cutting-edge tech. As the scene unfolds, many eyes remain on whether Huawei can challenge Nvidia's AI training dominance while sustaining inroads made in the inference landscape.

### Summary of Discussion:  
The Hacker News discussion about Huawei’s Ascend 910C AI chip and China’s semiconductor progress revolves around **technical challenges**, **geopolitical dynamics**, and **commercial viability debates**:

#### **1. Technical Challenges and SMIC’s Progress**  
- **Yield Comparisons**: SMIC’s 7nm-class (N+2) process reportedly achieves ~20% yields for the Ascend 910C, significantly lower than TSMC’s mature 7nm yields (~90% for Huawei’s Kirin 9000S phone chips). Skeptics argue larger chip sizes (e.g., 665mm2 for Ascend 910C vs. ~100mm2 for Kirin) severely impact yields, raising cost concerns.  
- **Design Improvements**: The 910C is noted as a redesign ("chiplet" packaging) of the 910B (previously made by TSMC), suggesting iterative progress. However, critics highlight Huawei/SMIC still rely on older DUV lithography tools like ASML’s NXT:2000i, lagging behind cutting-edge EUV tech.  

#### **2. Geopolitical Tensions and Taiwan**  
- **Taiwan’s Silicon Shield**: Users debate whether China’s semiconductor ambitions are tied to reunification with Taiwan. Some argue China aims to “make TSMC irrelevant” by advancing domestic production (via SMIC) and reducing reliance on Taiwanese/Western tech. Others counter that TSMC’s fabs would be destroyed in a conflict, leaving China dependent on U.S.-allied ASML tools regardless.  
- **Sanctions and Decoupling**: U.S. export controls on high-end GPUs (e.g., H100) and equipment (ASML EUV) force China to prioritize self-reliance. However, skeptics note China’s AI chips still trail in efficiency and scale, relying on subsidies and state-backed cloud projects.  

#### **3. Commercial Viability and Energy Costs**  
- **Subsidies vs. Market Realities**: Critics argue Huawei’s chips (and phones) survive due to heavy government subsidies and “political pricing,” not true commercial competitiveness. Others counter that China’s cheaper electricity (vs. Europe/U.S.) could offset power-hungry AI chips like the 910C.  
- **Nvidia’s Dominance**: Nvidia’s H100 (costing $3k to produce, sold at $25k) exemplifies Western pricing power. China struggles to match this due to sanctions, design limitations, and software ecosystem gaps (e.g., CUDA’s dominance).  

#### **4. Broader Implications**  
- **Global Supply Chains**: A hypothetical China-Taiwan conflict would disrupt chip supplies, but Taiwan’s “Silicon Shield” is seen as weakening as SMIC advances and the West reshores production (e.g., TSMC Arizona).  
- **AGI and Governance**: Some warn China’s centralized governance risks misaligned AI development, though others dismiss this as Western bias.  

**TL;DR**: Huawei/SMIC’s Ascend 910C shows incremental progress in AI inference but faces yield, efficiency, and ecosystem hurdles. Geopolitically, China’s chip push is intertwined with Taiwan tensions and tech decoupling, though doubts persist about sustainability without subsidies or cutting-edge tools. Nvidia’s software/hardware dominance remains unmatched.

Meta's latest tool, Automated Compliance Hardening (ACH), is revolutionizing the landscape of software testing and security. This innovative system leverages large language models (LLMs) to automate the process of mutation-guided test generation, specifically targeting undetected faults (mutants) within source code. ACH excels where traditional methods fall short by focusing on actual faults rather than simply increasing code coverage. It transforms vague descriptions of potential bugs into a powerful suite of tests, automatically generating both realistic faults and the tests to catch them.

At its core, ACH carries out three pivotal steps: engineers describe the bugs they are concerned about, ACH automatically generates a multitude of bugs, and finally, it creates tests to specifically catch these threats. This process not only enhances code resilience against regressions but does so efficiently and effectively, saving precious human labor.

Meta has already applied ACH to several platforms, including Facebook Feed, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and found it particularly useful for strengthening code against specific concerns. The tool is adaptable to any class of faults, promising to modernize automated test generation and help engineers derive actionable insights from diverse informational sources.

The significance of ACH lies not just in its technical innovation but also in its potential to simplify risk assessments, lighten cognitive burdens for developers, and bolster overall online safety. Future plans include expanding the deployment of ACH, seeking industry-wide adoption, and further advancing the system’s capabilities to optimize compliance testing. With ACH, Meta is setting a new standard for how we harden software systems against the ever-evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats.

The discussion revolves around two primary threads:  

1. **Test Generation & SWE-Bench Integration**:  
   - A user (`wstrnr`) discusses connecting test-generation capabilities (via SWE-Bench and a multimodal leaderboard).  
   - Another user (`chrstnsn`) inquires about the specifics, asking how test-generation tools (like Meta’s ACH) generate valid tests and address SWE-Bench issues.  
   - `wstrnr` clarifies that ACH uses code-adjacent comments and context to resolve SWE-Bench testing challenges.  

2. **Research Paper Recognition**:  
   - `wstrnr` shares a link to Meta’s 2025 scholarly paper on **mutation-guided LLM-based test generation**, referencing ACH’s methodology.  
   - Another user (`nds`) appreciates the direct link to the research, highlighting interest in technical details.  

Key themes: Focus on automating test generation via language models (Meta’s ACH), integration with benchmarking tools like SWE-Bench, and community interest in scholarly work underpinning practical solutions.

### DeepRAG: Thinking to retrieval step by step for large language models

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01142) | 181 points | by [fofoz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=fofoz) | [25 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42932948)

In an exciting development for the realm of Artificial Intelligence, a new paper titled "DeepRAG: Thinking to Retrieval Step by Step for Large Language Models" has been published on arXiv. Penned by Xinyan Guan and eight other authors, this research explores a novel framework called DeepRAG that could potentially elevate the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Despite their prowess in reasoning, LLMs still grapple with "factual hallucinations" stemming from issues like outdated or inaccurate knowledge. Current approaches combining reasoning with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) often struggle due to inefficient task division and superfluous retrieval processes that introduce noise and compromise response quality.

DeepRAG is introduced as a solution to these challenges, modeling retrieval-driven reasoning as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). This approach allows for strategic and adaptive knowledge retrieval, crucially enabling dynamic query decomposition. Essentially, DeepRAG can decide step-by-step whether to source external data or rely on internal reasoning, optimizing efficiency and accuracy.

Impressively, experiments demonstrate that DeepRAG enhances retrieval efficiency and boosts answer accuracy by nearly 22%. This noteworthy improvement underscores its efficacy in refining retrieval-augmented reasoning processes and marks a significant stride in AI development. For those interested in the nitty-gritty, the full paper is accessible on arXiv under the identifier arXiv:2502.01142 [cs.AI].

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion around the DeepRAG paper highlights practical challenges, critiques, and alternative approaches to improving Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Key themes include:

1. **Challenges with Existing RAG Tools:**
   - Users express frustration with simplistic RAG implementations (e.g., LangChain) for complex tasks, citing inefficiencies like redundant retrieval passes, latency, and noise from poorly chunked documents.
   - Specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical) struggle with general-purpose tools due to jargon and the need for precise context, often requiring thousands of annotated examples or expert input.

2. **Chunking Strategies & Custom Workflows:**
   - Effective document chunking (e.g., semantic or hierarchical splitting) is critical. Custom strategies (e.g., grouping tables, paragraphs, or technical specs) are emphasized over generic approaches.
   - Tools like `semantifly` (for agent workflows), `chunkify`, and `tl;dw` (a chunking library) are recommended. Some users advocate for AI models that parse PDFs with layout awareness (e.g., MathPix).

3. **Alternatives to Standard RAG:**
   - **graphRAG** (cited by Gartner) and methods leveraging folder structures/metadata for context are proposed as advanced alternatives.
   - Local models (via Ollama, Cursor) and minimalist frameworks are preferred by some, avoiding bloated tools like LangChain.

4. **Skepticism Toward DeepRAG's Claims:**
   - While DeepRAG’s 22% accuracy boost is noted, users question the reproducibility of results and critique the paper's phrasing ("Markov Decision Process") as jargon-heavy. Some stress that real-world RAG success hinges on implementation specifics beyond theoretical frameworks.

5. **Unique Success Cases:**
   - One user highlights success using Qwen’s multimodal model and base64 encoding to parse PDFs, while others emphasize the role of domain-specific fine-tuning and explicit metadata tagging.

Overall, the discussion underscores that while frameworks like DeepRAG aim to advance RAG, practical deployment requires careful chunking, domain adaptation, and often eschewing popular tools in favor of bespoke solutions.

### Radiant Foam: Real-Time Differentiable Ray Tracing

#### [Submission URL](https://radfoam.github.io) | 195 points | by [w-m](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=w-m) | [21 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42931109)

Radiant Foam is breaking new ground in the field of real-time differentiable ray tracing by offering a novel approach that maintains the efficiency and quality of Gaussian Splatting but circumvents its drawbacks. Developed by a team from Simon Fraser University, the University of British Columbia, University of Toronto, and Google Deepmind, this model leverages an overlooked volumetric mesh ray tracing algorithm from yesteryears, hailed for its simplicity and effectiveness in traversing complex scenes with ease.

At the heart of Radiant Foam lies the clever use of Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations. By structuring data points into a Voronoi diagram, the model simplifies the traditionally cumbersome process of ray tracing. It efficiently computes ray-cell intersections and navigates seamlessly through three-dimensional space, much like jumping from cell to cell in a beautifully orchestrated dance. This approach sidesteps the usual pitfalls of rasterization, such as difficulty in simulating light phenomena like reflection and refraction.

What sets Radiant Foam apart is its ability to perform without reliance on specialized hardware or APIs, needing only a standard programmable GPU. This makes it accessible and versatile, promising real-time ray tracing outcomes that don't sacrifice speed for visual fidelity. The method also gracefully bypasses the optimization challenges of discrete meshes, thanks to the continuous nature of Voronoi cell boundaries.

In a nutshell, Radiant Foam achieves what seemed elusive: bringing together the speed of rasterization with the precision of ray tracing in one comprehensive, real-time differentiable model. By doing so, it paves the way for more dynamic and flexible computer vision applications that offer high-quality renderings without breaking the computational bank.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on Radiant Foam Research:**

1. **Camera Model Debates:**  
   Users analyzed how Radiant Foam handles non-pinhole cameras (e.g., fisheye lenses), with some pointing out challenges in projecting curved lines compared to traditional pinhole models. While Gaussian Splatting can approximate distortions, critics raised concerns about its limitations under extreme distortion or when relying on approximations that might "break" the method.

2. **Algorithm Efficiency & Bottlenecks:**  
   Questions arose about computational efficiency, particularly whether the method avoids slow hierarchical acceleration structures (e.g., BVH). Skeptics noted that ray tracing algorithms often struggle with divergence in parallel architectures (e.g., SIMD), but supporters highlighted the novelty of Radiant Foam’s approach.

3. **Corporate Involvement & Applications:**  
   Google’s role drew mixed reactions. Some praised the team's "radiant foam" techniques, while others questioned affiliations (e.g., part-time researchers or overcrediting). Notably, users observed similarities to existing Google Maps features (e.g., Gaussian Splatting in 3D fly-throughs). Speculation also arose about future AR integration, though skepticism lingered about hardware constraints (e.g., Pixel phones lacking lidar).

4. **Research Validity & Critique:**  
   The paper faced criticism for allegedly glossing over flaws and comparing poorly to general-purpose techniques. Defenders countered that research often operates within practical constraints. A recurring theme was the tension between academic novelty and real-world applicability, with one user calling the results "hyper-real" but others urging deeper scrutiny.

5. **Broader Implications:**  
   Despite critiques, excitement persisted about the potential for high-quality, efficient 3D rendering in applications like photogrammetry and dynamic computer vision. Discussions acknowledged Google’s historical efforts in 3D mapping while emphasizing the need for transparency in academic-corporate collaborations.

This means no longer are you tethered to specific aspect ratios or body proportions. Whether you have a portrait, a half-body, or full-body image, OmniHuman magically synthesizes an authentic experience.

One of the most fascinating capabilities of OmniHuman is its prowess with weak signals, especially audio, creating videos that rival any handcrafted production. It's even got the singing chops, responding dynamically to a range of music styles and pitches with appropriate movement.

However, OmniHuman isn't available for download or service just yet. The creators urge caution against any fraudulent offerings and commit to providing updates as they develop this technology further.

In essence, OmniHuman is pushing the boundaries of how we think about animated human simulations, promising a future where creating realistic video outputs from scant resources becomes the norm.

   - Discussions about watermarking AI content and legal challenges (e.g., copyright lawsuits) highlighted broader societal debates over authenticity and regulation.  

3. **Comparisons & Competitor Context:**  
   - Users linked to earlier ByteDance iterations like **X-Portrait**, which focused on expressive portrait animations, and noted other projects (e.g., **MikuDance**, **PersonaTalk**) with narrower capabilities.  
   - Comments contrasted OmniHuman-1’s “full-body” scope with tools like **EMO2** (head/shoulders only) and expressed skepticism about achieving SORA/Google-level realism in motion timing.  

4. **Admiration & Skepticism:**  
   - Some praised the tech as “incredible” and inspiring, especially considering potential applications like low-bandwidth streaming or dynamic music-responsive videos.  
   - Others felt the demo’s flaws (e.g., stiff musical instrument timing, uncanny animations) revealed lingering challenges, though optimism persisted about future iterations.  

5. **Future Implications:**  
   - Speculation arose about misuse (e.g., deepfake proliferation) and cultural shifts toward “plastic” synthetic media norms.  
   - A subthread debated whether AI-generated content could ever match human-level subtleties in creative fields like music performance.  

Overall, the discussion balances cautious optimism for OmniHuman-1’s technical ambitions with scrutiny of its current limitations and ethical blind spots.

### How I use LLMs as a staff engineer

#### [Submission URL](https://www.seangoedecke.com/how-i-use-llms/) | 234 points | by [gfysfm](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=gfysfm) | [180 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42938409)

The debate around the utility of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering is hotter than ever. Some engineers hail these AI tools as revolutionary, while others dismiss them as hyped-up distractions. But according to a staff engineer's insights, the real key might be using these models correctly. He shares his experiences on how LLMs, particularly GitHub Copilot, have transformed his workflow.

For writing production code, Copilot serves as a powerful autocomplete tool, filling in boilerplate code and occasionally assisting in unfamiliar areas, like Golang or C. Though it's risky to rely heavily on AI in less-familiar domains without expert review, it boosts efficiency significantly for tactical changes.

When it comes to throwaway code, the engineer liberally uses LLMs. For non-production research tasks, AI speeds up processes like data classification and pattern recognition, halving the time needed.

LLMs also shine as on-demand tutors for learning new areas. By engaging in interactive dialogue, the engineer has leveraged them to grasp new domains, like Unity, quickly and effectively.

For bug fixes, while LLMs aren't perfect, sometimes they spot overlooked issues, offering a potential solution with minimal effort. However, they aren't surpassing human bug-hunting skills just yet.

In terms of drafting written documents such as ADRs and technical summaries, LLMs are used for proofreading rather than writing. They effectively catch typos and suggest insightful edits, although their style advice is often set aside.

In summary, he uses LLMs for:
- Smart autocomplete and initial drafts for less-familiar languages
- Rapid development of disposable research scripts
- Learning new technologies through Q&A
- Occasional debugging checks
- Proofreading for typos in technical writing

But he refrains from letting AI handle:
- Complete pull requests in domains he's confident in
- Writing formal documents or conducting extensive codebase research

With proper use, LLMs can still be a valuable tool in a software engineer's kit, offering enhanced productivity and new learning opportunities.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion reveals polarized views on LLMs' role in software engineering:
- **Supportive Views:**  
  Some developers (e.g., smnw) argue LLMs boost productivity in drafting code, learning new skills, and debugging when used responsibly. Corporate push for AI adoption is seen as aligning with efficiency goals.  

- **Critiques and Concerns:**  
  Others (e.g., tprrls) warn that over-reliance on LLMs risks degraded code quality, non-deterministic outputs, and eroded craftsmanship. Skeptics highlight executives’ misguided focus on AI as a cost-saving trend rather than understanding its limitations.  

- **Job Market and Skill Impact:**  
  Debates emerge about LLMs commoditizing coding skills, potentially saturating the job market (nyarlathotep_) or leading to demands for 10x productivity (Jevons Paradox, per kk). Codr7 and dasil003 stress that deep system design and business logic remain human-exclusive challenges.  

- **Corporate Dynamics:**  
  Criticisms target executives’ short-term AI investments (Yoric) and pressure on developers to adopt tools without clear ROI (gbx). Fear of job displacement persists, though rebuttals note LLMs complement, not replace, skilled engineers.  

- **Technical Limitations:**  
  While LLMs aid boilerplate, their inability to grasp context (th0ma5) or ensure reliability (tkyy) underscores the need for human oversight.  

**Key Takeaway:**  
The thread reflects tension between LLMs as productivity enhancers and existential threats, emphasizing responsible integration over blind adoption.
