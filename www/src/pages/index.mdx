In a recent thought-provoking piece, science fiction writer Ted Chiang critiques the common terminology associated with artificial intelligence (AI), arguing that it has historically misrepresented the capabilities of these technologies. He asserts that "artificial intelligence" is a misleading term, better replaced with "applied statistics," as many AI systems primarily operate on statistical models rather than genuine understanding or consciousness.

Chiang's perspective highlights a significant shift in AI research over the decades. The 1960s through the 1980s marked a period where non-statistical methods dominated, particularly during the initial enthusiasm for expert systems. However, the AI winter of the late 1980s crushed this momentum, leading to a dramatic reduction in funding and interest in AI. As a result, many AI-related activities were rebranded, overshadowed by emerging fields like machine learning.

As the dust settled, the AI community diversified, spawning various sub-disciplines that were no longer centered around traditional AI concepts. Figures like Rodney Brooks began to champion new approaches, focusing on embodied intelligence and robot interactions with their environments. This era also saw the rise of genetic algorithms and artificial life, borrowing concepts from biology to create systems capable of iterative learning and evolution.

Overall, the trajectory of AI research illustrates a complex interplay between hype, funding fluctuations, and evolving methodologies. Chiang's critique and historical overview spark discussions about the nature of intelligence in machines and the language we use to describe it, emphasizing the importance of clarity in the rapidly advancing field of AI.

The comments section reflects a vigorous debate surrounding Ted Chiang's critique of the term "artificial intelligence." Several users express frustration with what they perceive as misleading marketing in the AI field, pointing out that much of AI is essentially advanced statistics rather than true intelligence or consciousness. Some highlight the historical context of AI development, noting how funding cycles and shifts in focus have led to branding that often oversells capabilities.

Commenters also discuss the impact of venture capital and the tech industry's tendency to hype new technologies, drawing parallels between past trends and the current AI landscape. There’s recognition that while AI tools can provide significant benefits—like enhancing productivity—they can also lead to unrealistic expectations and potential disillusionment among users. 

Users express skepticism around the technological jargon used within the community and the broader implications of AI systems, including concerns about their tangible applications and the lack of an understanding of where they add real value. A few commenters voice the need for clearer and more accurate terminology, arguing for better reflection of AI’s true capabilities in marketing and common discourse. Overall, the discussion underscores a tension between excitement about technological advancements and caution regarding overhyping their potential.

### Playground Wisdom: Threads Beat Async/Await

#### [Submission URL](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/11/18/threads-beat-async-await/) | 34 points | by [samwillis](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=samwillis) | [17 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42171693)

In a thought-provoking blog post titled "Playground Wisdom: Threads Beat Async/Await," Armin Ronacher reflects on the limitations of the async/await paradigm in programming and proposes that leveraging threads may offer a more effective solution for handling concurrency issues. Ronacher revisits his previous thoughts on async systems' struggle with back pressure, arguing that many acclaimed theorists have laid bare the complexities within these models. 

He spotlights influential works, including Bob Nystrom's examination of function compatibility and Ron Pressler's critique of mixing pure functional concepts with imperative programming. The post encourages readers to appreciate the simplicity of actor-based programming, as illustrated through the familiar environment of Scratch, which provides an intuitive approach to concurrency for young learners. 

Ronacher further challenges the perception that imperative languages are inferior to their functional counterparts, asserting that both paradigms have their strengths. He emphasizes that understanding how different programming languages deal with concurrency—whether through threads or asynchronous constructs—is crucial for developers to embrace various programming methodologies without bias. Through this exploration, he invites readers to reconsider their assumptions about async programming and advocates for a broader understanding of concurrency in software development.

The discussion surrounding Armin Ronacher's blog post explores various perspectives on concurrency in programming, particularly contrasting async/await patterns with thread-based models. Participants express opinions on the differences between languages like JavaScript and C#, focusing on how they handle blocking and non-blocking operations.

Key points from the discussion include:

1. **Blocking vs. Non-Blocking:** Several commenters highlight how JavaScript's approach to asynchronous programming can lead to issues with long-running synchronous functions, which can block execution. In contrast, C# using the TaskWait method allows for more straightforward blocking behavior without running into these issues.

2. **Concerns About Async/Await:** Commenters express frustration with the async/await paradigm in JavaScript, mentioning that it can lead to infinite promise resolutions and difficulties in handling errors.

3. **Comparative Language Features:** The conversation includes insights on how different languages implement concurrency. For example, C#'s library methods are contrasted with JavaScript’s Promise methods, suggesting that the former provides a more robust framework for managing concurrent tasks. Some also highlight the efficiency of structured concurrency found in languages like Go and Elixir.

4. **Complexity in Purity vs. Imperative Styles:** The discussions touch upon various programming concepts, including the tension between functional programming principles and imperative programming practices. Commenters note the importance of acknowledging strengths in both paradigms rather than framing one as superior.

5. **Real-World Application:** Some participants share experiences from real-world scenarios, discussing challenges with handling concurrency in structured systems and the implications of threading and blocking behavior on performance and system architecture.

6. **General Sentiment:** While some express skepticism toward async/await, others emphasize its utility in certain contexts, suggesting that choosing the right tool depends on the specific requirements of the task at hand.

Overall, the discussion reflects a rich dialogue on concurrency in programming, revealing varying opinions on async/await vs. thread usage, the complexities of modern programming languages, and the practical challenges developers face in the real world.
