### Show HN: Boldly go where Gradient Descent has never gone before with DiscoGrad

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/DiscoGrad/DiscoGrad) | 221 points | by [frankling_](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=frankling_) | [64 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40481578)

DiscoGrad is a tool that aims to solve the challenge of obtaining useful gradients for programs involving both parameter-dependent branching control flow and randomness. Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a popular technique for obtaining gradients, but it often yields unhelpful gradients for such complex programs. DiscoGrad automatically transforms C++ programs to efficiently calculate smoothed gradients across branches, supporting smoothing via external perturbations if needed. The tool includes several gradient estimation backends and the option to integrate neural networks via Torch. While supporting basic C++ constructs, DiscoGrad is still a research prototype. The repository includes sample applications from various domains like transportation, crowd management, and epidemiology.

Users can get started by compiling the transformation code using clang and llvm, then using the provided sample programs for reference. The tool allows for running smoothed programs and computing gradients using different backends, providing a more useful derivative than traditional AD for optimization purposes. With DiscoGrad, users can address the challenges of obtaining meaningful gradients for C++ programs involving branching control flow and randomness, opening up possibilities for end-to-end training scenarios combining gradients with neural networks.

The discussion on the submission "DiscoGrad - Automatically Differentiate Across Conditional Branches in C++ Programs" on Hacker News covered various aspects of the tool and its implications:

### To the brain, reading computer code is not the same as reading language (2020)

#### [Submission URL](https://news.mit.edu/2020/brain-reading-computer-code-1215) | 272 points | by [thunderbong](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=thunderbong) | [188 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40480913)

Neuroscientists from MIT have discovered that reading computer code does not engage the brain's language-processing centers, but rather activates a general-purpose brain network called the multiple demand network. This network, responsible for complex cognitive tasks like solving math problems, is not the same as the language network. The study suggests that understanding computer code is a unique cognitive process distinct from language and math. By analyzing brain activity while participants read code in Python and ScratchJr, the researchers found minimal involvement of language regions and stronger activation of the multiple demand network. This sheds light on how the brain processes coding differently from other cognitive tasks.

The discussion on Hacker News regarding the submission about neuroscientists from MIT discovering that reading computer code engages a general-purpose brain network called the multiple demand network rather than the language-processing centers raised several interesting points. Some users discussed the similarities between reading code and engaging in tasks like solving math problems or reading stories, suggesting that the process involves understanding complex relationships and structures. There was also a comparison made between literate programming and traditional programming languages, highlighting the benefits of incorporating a storytelling aspect into code documentation. Additionally, some users talked about how reading code activates different cognitive processes compared to reading natural languages and the importance of understanding the higher-level principles behind code rather than focusing on individual details. Discussions also touched upon the differences in how compilers understand code compared to humans and the challenges of translating between different languages. Overall, the conversation explored the unique cognitive processes involved in understanding and working with computer code.
