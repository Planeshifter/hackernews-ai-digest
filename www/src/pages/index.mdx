## AI Submissions for Fri Nov 10 2023 {{ 'date': '2023-11-10T17:11:32.560Z' }}

### Don't build AI products the way everyone else is doing it

#### [Submission URL](https://www.builder.io/blog/build-ai) | 485 points | by [tortilla](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tortilla) | [224 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38221552)

Unique, valuable, and fast AI products require a different approach than what most people are currently doing. Steve Sewell, in his blog post, highlights some of the problems with the prevailing method of building AI products, such as using wrappers over pre-trained models like ChatGPT. He then presents an alternative solution.

One of the major issues with the current approach is a lack of differentiation. Many AI products being built are easily replicable because they utilize simple techniques with pre-trained models that anyone can copy. This presents a risk for products that rely on advanced AI technology for their unique value proposition.

Another problem is the cost associated with using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. These models are expensive to run due to their extensive size and complexity. In some cases, the cost of running the service exceeds what users are willing to pay. Additionally, LLMs can be painfully slow, especially for applications where text needs to be processed quickly and a delay in response time is impractical.

Furthermore, LLMs have limited customization capabilities. While fine-tuning can help to some extent, it may not be sufficient to achieve the desired results. This can lead to slow, expensive, and lower-quality products.

The solution proposed by Sewell is to create your own toolchain. By combining a fine-tuned LLM with a custom compiler and a custom-trained model, developers can build AI products that are faster, more reliable, cheaper, and more differentiated. This approach avoids the risk of copycat products and open-source clones appearing overnight. It also challenges the misconception that AI products rely on a single super intelligent model, highlighting the importance of specialized models connected through normal code.

Sewell emphasizes that building AI products using this alternative method is not as difficult as it may seem. Even moderately experienced developers can train their own models without the need for extensive data science or machine learning expertise. The result is a more unique and powerful AI product that stands out in the market.

The discussion on the Hacker News post revolves around the efficacy and limitations of using chatbots and large language models (LLMs) in AI products.

One user points out that not all AI products require the use of chatbots, and the focus should be on solving real problems rather than building technology just for the sake of it. They argue that many startups fall into the trap of building without a clear problem in mind and end up wasting resources.

Another user mentions that chatbots have been used for years by larger companies to improve customer experience and reduce call center staff. They argue that quality conversations and human connection are important in getting answers and solving problems.

Some users express concerns about the limitations and challenges of chatbots. They highlight that chatbots can be difficult to scale and often result in frustrating experiences for users. They also point out that chatbots may not fully understand human text and can sometimes lead to miscommunication.

There is a discussion about the power and drawbacks of giving chatbots control. Some users argue that chatbots have the potential to empower and scale customer support, while others highlight the risks of discrimination and vulnerable populations being left behind.

The conversation also touches on the potential of large language models like GPT-4 in revolutionizing customer support. Some users believe that the advancements in language models will greatly enhance chatbots' capabilities and impact the field of customer service.

Overall, the discussion highlights the need to balance the use of AI technology like chatbots with the importance of human connection and solving real problems effectively.

### AI could cause 'catastrophic' financial crisis – Yuval Noah Harari

#### [Submission URL](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/09/yuval-noah-harari-artificial-intelligence-ai-cause-financial-crisis) | 16 points | by [bookofjoe](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bookofjoe) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38220633)

Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to cause a "catastrophic" financial crisis, warns historian and author Yuval Noah Harari. He explains that the complexity of AI technology makes it difficult to anticipate all the dangers it poses. Unlike nuclear weapons, AI presents numerous dangerous scenarios, each with a small probability, that together could threaten human civilization. Harari sees last week's global AI safety summit, where leading governments expressed concern and pledged cooperation, as a significant step forward. He notes that AI's ability to make decisions, generate ideas, and learn independently makes it challenging to foresee and regulate all potential dangers. Harari highlights the finance sector as particularly vulnerable to AI-created crises, citing the 2007-08 financial crisis caused by poorly understood debt instruments. He warns that AI has the potential to create financial devices far more complex than anything humans can comprehend or regulate. While an AI-generated financial crisis may not directly destroy civilization, it could lead to indirect catastrophic consequences, such as triggering wars or conflicts. Harari emphasizes the need to establish powerful regulatory institutions that can swiftly identify and respond to emerging dangers, rather than relying solely on specific regulations and laws that may become outdated. He also suggests that AI safety institutes should employ experts knowledgeable about AI's potential impact on finance.

The discussion on Hacker News surrounding the submission about the potential financial crisis caused by AI is varied. Some users express skepticism about the claim, comparing AI to Bart Simpson driving a car off a cliff with cruise control. Others argue that the financial system is already disconnected from reality and that it would be difficult to comprehend the full implications of AI on finance. One user suggests that AI should be regulated to avoid unchecked control over systems that handle large amounts of money. Another user highlights the potential negative impacts of AI on investors. One user criticizes the article for proposing simple solutions to complex issues, while others point out that governments and major AI companies are already taking the dangers of AI seriously. The discussion also touches on topics such as mental health, the need for regulation, and the existing existential risks associated with AI. One comment is flagged for unclear reasons.
