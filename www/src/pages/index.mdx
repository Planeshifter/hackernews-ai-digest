### ByteCraft: Generating video games and animations through bytes

#### [Submission URL](https://emygervais.github.io/2025/03/15/bytecraft.html) | 24 points | by [atomroflbomber](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atomroflbomber) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43416400)

Imagine a world where, with just a text prompt, you can generate a complete video game or animation executable file. Meet ByteCraft, the ambitious project making its first foray into this exciting goal by training an AI model to create the bytes for games and animations based on a user's description.

ByteCraft is a marvel in early development, crafted by fine-tuning a 7-billion parameter Large Language Model (LLM) known as Qwen2.5. Over the course of four months, using only four GPUs, this model has been taught to understand and generate byte sequences - all within a 32K generation context. The results are semi-functional and, occasionally, fully operational game or animation files.

This challenging endeavor works at the byte-level, meaning precision is crucial; a single incorrect byte can render an entire file unusable. However, ByteCraft manages to produce a diversity of files, showcasing a budding grasp of byte-level composition. By employing Byte-Pair-Encoding, the model can translate these bytes into tokens, allowing it to generate files up to 140Kb in size – a significant feat given the complexity.

To view examples of ByteCraft's work, such as moving patterns, characters, and sounds, you can visit the project page. These outputs are early stages of what ByteCraft can do, with some files requiring browser adjustments or specific extensions for proper viewing.

ByteCraft is drawing parallels to the evolution of autoregressive molecule generation, a field where similar challenges are being overcome. From the initial phase in 2016, with only 0.7% valid molecules, to now nearing 100% valid (although not always synthesizable) results, the progress in molecule generation provides a hopeful trajectory for ByteCraft's future.

This project is still in its infancy but with the rapid advancements in AI, ByteCraft's creators envision a time when generating entirely new games at high context lengths becomes routine. As more computational power is applied, the potential of ByteCraft can only grow. This initiative aims to inspire both researchers and hobbyists to explore the boundaries of game generation through the power of bytes.

The discussion around ByteCraft revolves around its use of the **SWF (Shockwave Flash)** format, with commenters debating its practicality and complexity:  

1. **SWF Format Critique**:  
   - Users note that SWF is an outdated format (originally tied to Macromedia/Adobe Flash) and question why the project targets it. Some suggest it might be for nostalgic brand recognition or leveraging existing SWF game datasets from platforms like Newgrounds/Kongregate.  

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   - SWF files are described as highly complex, combining executable code, vector graphics, animations, sounds, and interactivity. Generating valid SWFs at the byte level is seen as a significant technical hurdle, with even minor errors rendering files unusable.  

3. **Skepticism and Curiosity**:  
   - Commenters express doubt about the current examples, asking if the generated SWFs are truly "game-like" or just simple animations. Others speculate whether training on robust SWF game datasets could improve functionality, though the novelty of the approach is acknowledged.  

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - The discussion draws parallels to AI-generated content’s evolution, with some users cautiously optimistic about ByteCraft’s long-term potential despite early limitations.  

In summary, the thread highlights both technical skepticism about SWF as a target format and cautious interest in ByteCraft’s ambitious approach to byte-level generative AI.

### An early look at cryptographic watermarks for AI-generated content

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.cloudflare.com/an-early-look-at-cryptographic-watermarks-for-ai-generated-content/) | 36 points | by [jgrahamc](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jgrahamc) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43412179)

As generative AI revolutionizes various facets of our lives, it's important to consider the unintended consequences of this technology, particularly in terms of identifying AI-generated content on the web. With the overwhelming presence of AI-crafted text, code, images, audio, and video, it has become quite challenging to discern AI artifacts from authentic content.

The introduction of cryptographic watermarks presents a potential solution. These watermarks involve embedding identifying information within AI-generated artifacts during the training or inference processes. This technique makes it possible for models and consumers alike to recognize AI-produced content, thus safeguarding data integrity and preventing the pollution of training data with AI-generated material. 

This watermarking concept is similar in aim to the C2PA initiative, which seeks to ensure content provenance across various media types. While C2PA relies on a visible chain of digital signatures, watermarks embed information directly into media (like the pixels of an image), offering resilience even after modifications.

Emerging cryptographic watermarking approaches aim to guarantee robustness, undetectability, and unforgeability of AI artifacts. Such techniques use sophisticated models, akin to Google's SynthID and Meta's Video Seal, and focus on ensuring these qualities without affecting output quality. A cryptographic approach offers a way to transcend the traditional cat-and-mouse dynamics of security engineering by focusing on narrower, more definable attack surfaces. 

Although this field is still young, and it remains to be seen whether these solutions will be practical at scale, this promising area of research could reshape how we manage and verify AI-generated content. As the exploration of pseudorandom codes continues, the tech community eagerly awaits the next breakthrough in deploying robust, indefensible markings in AI artifacts.

The Hacker News discussion on cryptographic watermarks for AI-generated content highlights a mix of skepticism, technical considerations, and broader implications:  

1. **Skepticism & Practical Challenges**:  
   - Many doubt the efficacy of watermarks, arguing that motivated attackers could strip or bypass them. Comments note that AI providers may lack incentives to enforce watermarking, and unmarked AI content could still proliferate.  
   - Critics point to technical hurdles: manipulated media (e.g., screenshots, resizing) might erase watermarks, rendering them fragile. Others question the practicality of enforcing universal adoption, especially among open-source models.  

2. **Existing Initiatives & Alternatives**:  
   - Some users reference frameworks like **C2PA** and the **Content Authenticity Initiative (CAI)**, which embed provenance data (e.g., signed metadata in Nikon/Sony cameras). However, concerns persist about forgery—e.g., faked camera sensor data or editing tools stripping signatures.  

3. **Regulation & Drawbacks**:  
   - Regulation is seen as a double-edged sword. Mandating watermarks could burden platforms and stifle creativity, while bad actors might ignore rules. Others argue that even robust regulation might fail if adoption is fragmented.  

4. **Behavioral Realities**:  
   - Users emphasize human laziness and indifference. For example, AI-generated Amazon reviews or social media comments already slip through undetected, suggesting many won’t bother verifying watermarks.  

5. **Technical vs. Philosophical Debates**:  
   - Some oppose watermarking as antithetical to the internet’s open ethos, while others advocate for hardware-based signatures (e.g., cryptographically signed photos) or browser-level verification.  

6. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Concerns about AI-generated content polluting training data persist, with fears that detection tools may become a legal liability for platforms. A minority suggest global unique identifiers for content, though this raises privacy and control issues.  

In essence, while cryptographic watermarks are a promising step, the discussion underscores deep-seated challenges in enforcement, technical robustness, and alignment with the internet’s decentralized nature. The path forward likely hinges on hybrid solutions combining regulation, technical innovation, and proactive platform policies.

### Cellebrite Puts AI in Cell Phone-Scraping Tool So Cops Can Hallucinate Evidence

#### [Submission URL](https://www.techdirt.com/2025/03/18/cellebrite-dumps-ai-into-its-cell-phone-scraping-tool-so-cops-can-hallucinate-evidence/) | 53 points | by [hn_acker](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hn_acker) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43404080)

In a recent piece on TechDirt, Tim Cushing delves into the complex world of law enforcement technology and its growing reliance on AI, specifically through Cellebrite's decision to infuse AI into their phone-scraping tool, Guardian. The idea behind this move is to streamline the tedious task of analyzing seized evidence, but concerns are growing over accuracy and legal boundaries.

Cellebrite's updated Guardian software now leverages generative AI to summarize conversations, contextualize web histories, and map out relationships in a suspect's data. However, this tech comes with a caveat—AI's infamous tendency to "hallucinate" or misinterpret data, potentially leading to false incriminations. This risk is particularly concerning given law enforcement's interest in discovering crimes beyond their current investigations, effectively flipping the principle of probable cause on its head.

A detective from the small town of Susquehanna Township in Pennsylvania claims that the AI helped uncover an international organized crime link in what seemed like minor porch package thefts, though there's scant public evidence to substantiate this claim. The larger issue at hand is whether these AI searches comply with Fourth Amendment rights, which protect against unreasonable searches. The courts may soon have to decide if AI-assisted searches are permissible, or if they breach constitutional boundaries, setting a critical precedent for future tech-driven investigations.

The Hacker News discussion on Cellebrite's AI-powered phone-scraping tool reflects skepticism and concern about its implications for law enforcement and civil liberties:  

### Key Themes:  
1. **AI Hallucinations & Reliability**:  
   - Users like **gzz** and **outer_web** warn that AI-generated summaries risk producing false evidence ("hallucinations"), comparing it to relying on a "Ouija board" in court. Critics argue AI summaries could mislead investigators or jurors who overtrust its outputs.  
   - **ndymmphsh** counters that AI could help investigators sift through vast data efficiently, but others fear this prioritizes speed over accuracy, with **pixl97** sarcastically noting it might reduce "1,000 hours of video to 666 crimes."  

2. **Legal & Constitutional Concerns**:  
   - **clown_strike** questions Fourth Amendment compliance, arguing AI tools might enable "fishing expeditions" by law enforcement, bypassing probable cause. Subthreads highlight fears of "mental bondage" to flawed AI conclusions and jurisdictional overreach.  
   - The debate touches on whether courts will accept AI-summarized evidence, with concerns about due process and arbitrary interpretations.  

3. **Bias and Trust**:  
   - **gncdcbnny** suggests people (including jurors) may uncritically accept AI outputs due to ignorance or confirmation bias, especially in polarized contexts. HN’s user base is seen as disproportionately skeptical of AI in law enforcement.  
   - **MichaelZuo** humorously notes the irony of AI-generated comments discussing AI risks, underscoring meta-concerns about automation’s role in discourse.  

4. **Broader Implications**:  
   - Users link Cellebrite’s Israeli ties to critiques of global surveillance partnerships (e.g., NYPD contracts) and question the separation between intelligence agencies and law enforcement tools.  
   - The original article’s title correction (**hn_acker**) sparks minor side discussion about editorial accuracy.  

### Conclusion:  
The thread reflects deep unease about AI’s role in policing, balancing potential efficiency gains against risks of error, bias, and erosion of constitutional rights. Critics demand stringent oversight, while supporters see it as an inevitable tool for modern investigations.

While the local processing feature wasn't flawless—transcripts of requests were still sent to Amazon's cloud—the company's shift underscores the ongoing tensions between advanced AI functionalities and user privacy. Amazon insists that the change won't compromise privacy, aligning with its emphasis on secure cloud processing. Yet, the decision highlights the growing focus on generative AI within the Amazon ecosystem, particularly through Alexa+, a service linked to Prime membership or a $19.99 monthly fee.

Despite reassurances from Amazon, skepticism remains. The tech giant's track record with privacy, particularly around data use and retention, has been controversial. From allegations of leveraging voice data for targeted advertising to scrutiny over third-party app privacy policies, Amazon's privacy practices have frequently been under the microscope. With the new direction for Alexa, users face a trade-off: embrace cloud processing for more robust AI capabilities or grapple with limited features for not opting in to Amazon's data landscape.
