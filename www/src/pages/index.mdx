#### [Submission URL](https://cacm.acm.org/research-highlights/computing-with-time-microarchitectural-weird-machines/) | 125 points | by [rbanffy](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rbanffy) | [22 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42235418)

In a groundbreaking study, researchers introduce the concept of microarchitectural weird machines (µWMs), which leverage the intricate behaviors of modern CPUs to craft a novel form of computation powered by side effects from microarchitectural components like branch predictors and caches. This approach opens the door to a unique obfuscation technique that allows malware to stealthily execute harmful actions while remaining invisible to conventional detection methods. Notably, the researchers demonstrate a µWM cleverly disguising malware that remains dormant until it receives a specific trigger, at which point it decrypts and executes a payload.

The paper also details the construction of these µWMs, which consist of weird registers (WRs), weird gates (WGs), and weird circuits (WCs), showcasing their ability to perform complex computations such as generating SHA-1 hashes. This innovative framework represents a potential game-changer in program obfuscation, as existing security tools typically overlook the underlying microarchitectural interactions, making µWMs resistant to traditional analysis techniques. As side-channel attacks become more prevalent, this research raises intriguing implications for the future of security and malware development in computing systems.
