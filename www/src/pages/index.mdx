### I made a transformer to predict a simple sequence manually

#### [Submission URL](https://vgel.me/posts/handmade-transformer/) | 329 points | by [lukastyrychtr](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=lukastyrychtr) | [84 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37609393)

In a blog post on September 11, 2023, the author shares their experience of building a transformer from scratch without training it. They wanted to gain a deeper understanding of transformers and attention, so they decided to manually assign each weight for a decoder-only transformer inspired by GPT-2.

The author starts by picking a task that is not too easy but also not too challenging. They settle on predicting a sequence of "aabaabaabaab...," which requires querying the previous two tokens to determine the next token. To simplify the problem, they use a tokenization scheme where "a" is represented by 0 and "b" by 1.

Next, the author designs the model based on jaymody's picoGPT implementation of GPT-2. They define functions for softmax, linear transformations, and attention calculations. The attention function takes in query (q), key (k), and value (v) matrices, and a mask, and returns the attention weights. The causal_self_attention function applies causal masking to hide future inputs and performs the attention calculation. The transformer_block function is then used to add the output of the attention calculation to the input.

Finally, the author mentions that they have implemented the necessary functions up to this point and will continue explaining the remaining parts in the next blog post.

This hands-on approach to building a transformer without relying on pretrained weights or training provides the author with a better understanding of transformers and attention. It also serves as a valuable resource for readers interested in delving into the inner workings of transformers.

The discussion on the Hacker News submission revolves around various aspects of the blog post that describes building a transformer from scratch without training it. Here are some notable points from the discussion:

- One user shares a link to a blog post about Thinking Transformers, which explores using a primitive programming language called RASP to simulate the components of a transformer model.
- Others express interest in the hands-on approach and recommend following the work demonstrated by the author.
- One user notes that they initially struggled to understand transformers when they implemented them from scratch without pretraining. Their experience was different from the standard PyTorch transformer implementation, and they realized that training and backpropagation were not as straightforward as expected.
- Another user shares a link to a video by Andrej Karpathy discussing building a Neural Network from scratch, which they find relevant to the topic.
- The challenge of working with weights in models and the interpretability of specific clusters of neurons are discussed.
- The discussion delves into the idea of compressing machine learning models and the potential for more efficient and controllable interfaces.
- Some users highlight the difficulty of manually adjusting weights and the downstream effects of modifying weights in transformers.
- The attention mechanisms present in transformers are discussed, and it is noted that they do not necessarily represent semantics understandable to humans.
- The complexity and interpretability of weights in transformers are compared to the Traveling Salesman Problem, and the limitations of solving certain problems with transformers are mentioned.

Overall, the discussion appreciates the hands-on approach of building a transformer from scratch and dives into various technical aspects and implications of the topic.

### Outperforming larger language models with less training data and smaller models

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.research.google/2023/09/distilling-step-by-step-outperforming.html) | 309 points | by [atg_abhishek](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=atg_abhishek) | [118 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37606352)

A team of researchers from Google's Cloud AI team has developed a new mechanism called "distilling step-by-step" that allows smaller task-specific models to outperform larger language models (LLMs) with less training data. LLMs, such as BERT and T5, have revolutionized the field of natural language processing but tend to be computationally expensive and require large amounts of data. The researchers found that by extracting informative natural language rationales from LLMs, they could train smaller models more efficiently. These rationales, which explain the connections between input questions and their corresponding outputs, provide additional supervision during training. The team demonstrated that a 770M parameter T5 model could outperform a 540B parameter PaLM model using only 80% of the examples in a benchmark dataset. This approach offers a potential solution for deploying high-performance natural language models in applications with limited computational resources.

The discussion on this submission revolves around the use of smaller task-specific models versus larger language models (LLMs) in natural language processing. Some users argue that using multiple smaller models instead of a single large model can be more effective in certain applications.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04827) | 104 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [52 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37583136)

A recent paper titled "Neurons in Large Language Models: Dead, N-gram, Positional" analyzes the behavior of neurons in large language models. The researchers focus on the OPT family of models, ranging from 125m to 66b parameters, and study whether an FFN neuron is activated or not. They find that the early part of the network is sparse and represents discrete features, with a significant percentage of neurons being "dead," meaning they never activate on diverse data. The researchers also observe that alive neurons in these models serve as token and n-gram detectors and that the corresponding FFN updates remove information about triggering tokens. Interestingly, this is the first example of mechanisms specialized in removing information from the residual stream. As models scale, they become even more sparse, with a higher number of dead neurons and token detectors. Finally, the researchers identify positional neurons, which are activated or not depending largely on position rather than textual data.

The discussion on this submission covers various topics related to artificial neural networks and their behavior. 

- Some commenters discuss the concept of dead neurons and their association with ReLU networks. There is a debate about whether dead neurons are actually beneficial or not in network regularization. Anecdotal evidence and alternative activation functions such as Leaky ReLUs and Mish are also mentioned.
- The understanding of artificial neural networks and how they process input data is questioned. It is noted that the researchers may not fully understand the concept of artificial neurons and their role in categorizing and decoding data. The discussion touches on common arguments and comments regarding the reduction of models' size and the removal of dead neurons.
- Commenters discuss the potential methods for reducing model size by tracking neuron activation frequency during training or through weight pruning techniques. Examples of K-Means algorithms and clustering centers are mentioned as ways to regularize dead neurons.
- The topic of pruning in neural networks is brought up. Structured pruning is mentioned as a method to remove weights with minimal impact on quality, and there is a suggestion that randomization or column removal during training can also be effective.
- The complexity and challenges of pruning networks are discussed, with some mention of methods like activation pruning and weight pruning. The trade-off between accuracy and efficiency is acknowledged, and the penalties for sparsity in neural networks are mentioned.
- There is a discussion of the limitations and capabilities of artificial neural networks compared to human brain function. Commenters express surprise at the ability of neural networks to approximate human-level functioning in tasks like visual recognition and pattern matching. The importance of reinforcement learning and alignment in human intelligence is also mentioned.
- The topic of simulating real neurons and their complexities is brought up. Commenters note that accurately simulating the behavior of neurons and their connectivity in the brain is difficult and that mapping neural connectivity is a challenging task.
- The concept of qualia, consciousness, and the philosophical implications of artificial intelligence are briefly discussed, with some mention of the complexity of understanding and replicating certain aspects of human cognition.
- Finally, there are discussions about the logic capabilities of individual neurons and the complexity of XOR logic in neural networks. Some commenters mention that XOR logic can be achieved by single-layer perceptrons, while others propose that XOR logic is not a breakthrough and that the problem of NP-hardness still exists.
