### What We Learned from a Year of Building with LLMs (Part II)

#### [Submission URL](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-we-learned-from-a-year-of-building-with-llms-part-ii/) | 23 points | by [tim_sw](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tim_sw) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40558044)

In the second part of the series on building with Large Language Models (LLMs), the authors delve into the operational aspects of creating LLM applications, bridging the gap between strategy and tactics. They address key questions related to data, models, product, and people.

1. **Data**: Quality input data is crucial for LLM performance. Monitoring LLM inputs and outputs regularly is essential to understand data distribution, detect skew, and ensure alignment between development and production data. Skew can be structural (formatting discrepancies) or content-based (differences in meaning or context). Strategies to mitigate skew include tracking metrics like input/output length, conducting qualitative assessments of outputs ("vibe checks"), and incorporating non-determinism into skew checks.

2. **Models**: Integrating LLMs into the tech stack and managing versioning are key considerations. Thinking about how to version models, migrate between versions, and maintain compatibility is crucial. Balancing conflicting requirements, involving design early in the development process, and prioritizing user experiences are vital aspects of product development.

3. **Product**: Designing user experiences with human-in-the-loop feedback, calibrating product risk, and prioritizing requirements are essential for successful LLM applications. Cultivating a culture of experimentation, hiring the right talent, and leveraging emerging LLM applications to build your own are important for team success.

4. **People**: Hiring the right team members, fostering a culture of experimentation, and navigating the balance between process and tooling are key considerations for building successful LLM applications.

By focusing on these operational aspects, organizations can effectively develop and manage LLM applications and the teams that build them, ensuring the optimal performance and impact of their machine learning systems.
