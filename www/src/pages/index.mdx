### Standard cells: Looking at individual gates in the Pentium processor

#### [Submission URL](http://www.righto.com/2024/07/pentium-standard-cells.html) | 194 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [90 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40899393)

Intel made waves in 1993 with the release of the powerful Pentium processor, a chip that set the bar high for performance-hungry users. Over the years, the Pentium line evolved, cementing its place as Intel's flagship processors until the Core series took over in 2006. Despite its complexity with 3.3 million transistors, the original Pentium chip's inner workings are visible under a microscope, showcasing unique circuits like gates, flip-flops, and BiCMOS technology.

Taking a close look at the Pentium's design reveals a structured approach known as standard-cell design, where circuits are organized in uniform rows of cells, creating a distinctive striped pattern on the chip. This technique replaced the labor-intensive manual layout of transistors used in earlier processors, offering efficiency through a library of standard blocks for various components. Automation tools like automatic place and route software help optimize the layout by minimizing wire distances and reducing signal interference.

Standard-cell design, though still employed in modern processors, has come a long way since its early days, enabling more advanced and efficient chip designs. The article also delves into the basics of CMOS circuitry, illustrating how NMOS and PMOS transistors work together to power these high-performance processors.
