MK-1 is a new startup that aims to provide companies with the same efficient language model capabilities as elite AI powerhouses like OpenAI and Google. Their first product, MKML, is an inference runtime that can significantly reduce the costs and improve the performance of large language models on GPUs.

One of the main challenges that MKML addresses is the large memory footprint of these models, which can limit performance and increase costs. MKML has developed a compression technique that can reduce the size of models by about 60%, while maintaining a high fidelity to the original model. For example, a Llama-2 13B model that initially requires 26GB of memory can be shrunk down to just 10.5GB with MKML.

The benefits of using MKML are twofold. Firstly, it allows companies to use lower-cost GPU instances that have less memory capacity, without sacrificing performance. For example, the compressed Llama-2 13B model can now fit on a single A10 24GB instance, which is about 45% less expensive than the A100 instance. Secondly, for companies that can afford the more powerful A100 instance, MKML can increase performance by up to 2.0x compared to the baseline model.

MKML is designed to be easy to integrate into existing workflows and works seamlessly with popular ecosystems like Hugging Face and PyTorch. With just a few lines of Python code, developers can compress their models and use MKML for inference.

The performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, and the results consistently show that it outperforms the baseline model in terms of token generation speed. Additionally, the compressed models maintain a high level of fidelity, with only a small difference in perplexity compared to the original models.

MK-1 is currently in closed beta release, but if you're interested in becoming an early partner and gaining access to new features, you can contact them for more information. With MKML, companies can optimize their inference stack, reduce costs, and improve the efficiency of their language models.

The discussion around the submission on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of MKML and its comparison to existing methods.

One commenter points out that quantization methods that are already available usually provide comparable results to what MKML is claiming. They mention that these techniques have already been widely used and question the novelty of MKML's approach.

The founder of MK-1, Paul Merolla, responds to address the comments. He explains that MKML is designed to be a targeted solution that focuses on compressing models with high performance and efficiency. He highlights that MKML builds on the existing framework of Hugging Face and other popular ecosystems. He also mentions that the performance of MKML has been benchmarked with different batch sizes and GPUs, consistently outperforming the baseline models.

Another commenter raises a question about the integration of MKML and the existing frameworks like Hugging Face. Paul Merolla responds and clarifies that MKML is not simply repackaging existing frameworks, but rather integrating its own compression scheme. He emphasizes that MKML targets multi-task, multi-prompt batch=1 use cases and achieves faster token generation speed compared to other methods.

The discussion further delves into specific technical questions about memory footprint, batch sizes, and model performance. Paul Merolla provides detailed answers and also mentions that MK-1 is working on wrapping their techniques and tools into open-source software.

The latest version of OpenAI's language model, GPT-4, has been causing some confusion due to its non-deterministic behavior. Even when set to a temperature of 0.0, which should result in deterministic output, GPT-4 still produces different results. This has raised questions about why this behavior persists, especially since it was reported over three years ago.

A recent paper on Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models may provide some insights. In the paper, it was mentioned that MoE models, like GPT-4, can become non-deterministic at the sequence level when tokens from different sequences compete against each other for available spots in expert buffers. This suggests that the non-determinism in GPT-4 could be attributed to its Sparse MoE architecture.

To test this hypothesis, the author decided to ask GPT-4 itself by writing a script that generates multiple completions using different models. The results of the experiment confirmed that GPT-4's non-determinism is consistent across models, providing further evidence for the impact of its Sparse MoE architecture.

While the exact cause of the non-determinism is still not fully understood, this research offers valuable insights into the behavior of GPT-4 and highlights the challenges in achieving full determinism in complex language models.

### Why transformative artificial intelligence is hard to achieve

#### [Submission URL](https://thegradient.pub/why-transformative-artificial-intelligence-is-really-really-hard-to-achieve/) | 79 points | by [hunglee2](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=hunglee2) | [56 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36934032)

Transformative artificial intelligence (AI) has been talked about as the next major technological breakthrough that could revolutionize the world. But according to a recent essay, achieving this level of AI is actually extremely difficult. The article highlights several challenges that stand in the way of transformative AI.

One of the main challenges is the complexity of AI itself. AI systems would need to be as good as or better than humans at all economically valuable tasks in order to be truly transformative. However, measuring AI's performance on predetermined tasks is risky, as there may be tasks we're not even aware of that are necessary for real-world impact. The essay defines transformative AI in terms of its observed economic impact, specifically looking at productivity growth.

Another challenge is the potential imbalance in productivity growth. Even if AI progresses rapidly in certain areas, there may still be major technical hurdles to overcome in other areas. And even if AI can automate many tasks, it may not be able to automate all tasks, leaving certain sectors relatively more valuable and limiting the overall impact on the economy. This has been observed in the past, where productivity growth has been uneven across sectors, leading to slower overall growth.

Furthermore, the production of ideas itself has bottlenecks that are difficult to overcome. Automating certain tasks may have different effects on growth compared to automating all tasks. Some steps in the innovation process may be essential but hard to improve, leading to constraints on explosive growth.

Overall, the essay suggests that while AI has the potential to be transformative, there are significant challenges that need to be addressed. It's important to temper expectations and recognize the complexities and limitations of achieving transformative AI.

The discussion on this submission covers a range of topics related to transformative AI. Some users question whether AI can truly make significant contributions to society, particularly in the realm of mathematics, while others argue that AI has the potential to generate novel mathematical proofs. There is also a discussion about the limitations of current AI models, such as their lack of true understanding and the need for more diverse training data. The topic of intelligence and the definition of intelligence in AI systems is also touched upon. Additionally, there is a debate about whether AI can surpass human capabilities, with some suggesting that AI should be seen as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for humans.

#### [Submission URL](https://dombytes.com/post/oops-google-did-it-again/) | 69 points | by [bezout](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bezout) | [12 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36921634)

In a recent Hacker News submission titled "The Web Environment Integrity Proposal: A Good Idea or Recipe for Anti-Competitive Practices?" the author discusses Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal. The proposal suggests creating a Web API that allows websites to assess the trustworthiness of a client device before delivering content. While this concept has been implemented by Apple with their Private Access Tokens (PATs), the concern lies in Google's market dominance through Chrome (popular web browser) and Android (leading mobile operating system). If Google were to control the attesters, it could create an anti-competitive environment, making it difficult for new OSes, device vendors, and web browsers to gain access to this functionality. The best case scenario is that Google handles this power responsibly, leading to a more secure and efficient web experience without CAPTCHAs and fake engagement. However, the worst case scenario could result in a walled garden where Google controls which devices are deemed trustworthy, stifling innovation and reinforcing planned obsolescence. The submission suggests that while we allowed Google to attain its current monopoly, it is crucial to consider whether a CAPTCHA-free, bot-less web is worth the potential consequences.

The discussion on the submission revolves around the potential consequences and concerns of Google's Web Environment Integrity (WEI) proposal.

- One user points out that the sentence "doesn't consider the worst-case scenario," stating that Silicon Valley has become accustomed to summarizing wrong tech trends over the past 15+ years.
- Another user brings up the disadvantages of DRM, mentioning that if John Deere's tractor maintenance can be considered a distressing example, it highlights the negative aspects of DRM.
- One commenter expresses concern about the potential for attestation in today's web becoming the foundation for tomorrow's web, with the majority supporting this concept. They note that the WEI proposal acknowledges the risk of centralizing testing, and suggests that browsers could handle testing themselves, allowing market share to determine testing standards instead.
- Another user wonders if web crawlers aren't controlled by Google, as they might be unable to access valid tokens.
- Someone argues that computer scientists' worst-case scenario allows for the risk of false complaints about WEI and Private Access Tokens (PATs), but Google's dominant position with Chrome and Android could lead to non-competitive practices. They also mention that WEI and PATs are not necessarily directly harmful, but they question their non-competitive purposes.
- In response, another user highlights that attestation can be incentivizing for particular website owners and non-incentivizing for those that offer a decent user experience without being attested. They claim that Apple's PATs cannot make the web standard, but Google successfully pushed it by making it the default. They also mention that PATs are compatible on the web, while WEI is not.
- Another user adds that the transformation is happening, as the majority of services and systems capable of attestation are sleeping in a slippery slope world where content and commercial activity are largely pulled towards the most popular browser again. They also note that other browser makers are gradually adhering to this trend.
- One user mentions a related post that discusses the combined impact of WEI and Safari on market share, indicating that Safari has a significant market share.
- A reply to that comment further breaks down submarket share, pointing out that iOS is a safer system by forgetting it.

Overall, the discussion highlights concerns about the potential anti-competitive practices associated with Google's WEI proposal, as well as the implications of centralized testing and attestation control. Some users express skepticism about the motivations behind WEI and the potential consequences for the web ecosystem.

A proposal has been put forward for a general neural network (NN) architecture that can handle arbitrary tasks and scale up MLPs (multi-layer perceptrons). The architecture, called Absolute Unit NN (AUNN), aims to enable meta-learning prediction of arbitrary data inputs and outputs. The training data is encoded into a list, and the NN is trained to predict from the one-dimensional unit input of the absolute index of a data point to that data point unit. This allows the NN to generalize and rapidly learn new datapoints in a single gradient descent step. The AUNN architecture has several advantages, including simplicity, minimal inductive bias, generality of input/output, and hardware-friendliness. It also has potential applications in language-conditioned AUNNs and modular brain AUNNs. However, one disadvantage is that it may require a large scale of data and compute before it can effectively generalize and meta-learn. The proposal draws inspiration from various existing NN architectures and methodologies, such as self-supervised Transformers, neural radiance fields, and meta-reinforcement learning. The goal is to extend the capabilities of MLPs to handle diverse input/output modalities without the need for complex and computationally expensive dense layers.

In the discussion on Hacker News, there were a couple of comments. One commenter mentioned that this proposal reminded them of non-verbal reasoning and index learning, providing a link to a related article. Another commenter expressed their enthusiasm for the proposal and described it as amazing, also sharing a link to a GitHub repository. In response to this comment, another user suggested that they are working on a similar project using neural radiance fields (NeRF) and mentioned that implementing it should not be too difficult.
