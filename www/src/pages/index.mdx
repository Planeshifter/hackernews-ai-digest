### Google uses int8 for LLM training

#### [Submission URL](https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17sbjsv/google_blog_posts_suggests_that_google_using_int8/) | 45 points | by [tosh](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=tosh) | [20 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38229928)

Google is utilizing reduced numerical precision of 8-bit integers (INT8) instead of 16-bit floats (BF16) for training its language models, according to a blog post. The company has built an accurate quantized training (AQT) library that allows machine learning engineers to achieve higher performance during training and higher model quality in production. This approach takes advantage of the fact that ML accelerators have twice the compute speed when using INT8 operations compared to BF16 operations. If Google can successfully train models using INT8, it could potentially pave the way for more cost-effective training methods that could be adopted by the open-source community.

Discussion:

1. User "nbckng" points out that the use of reduced precision in training models can lead to suboptimal solutions and may not converge to the desired outcome. They mention that some researchers have published work on binary activations and stochastic fashion for training neural networks.
2. User "sigmoid10" adds that differentiability is essential in training models using gradient descent, regardless of the specific mathematical methods employed. They mention that there are alternative training methods for neural networks that do not rely on differentiability.
3. User "stvnhng" disagrees with the statement that the human brain does not work similarly to how training models do. They mention that there is relevant research suggesting that the brain reduces uncertainty by making predictions based on internal models.
4. User "thrwbdbd" suggests that building mathematical numbers using bits can be done by operating between partitions. User "rscy" adds that arithmetic can be implemented between partitions, but lower precision and smaller value ranges may lead to fewer bits being required.
5. User "_nalply" believes that four bits might be sufficient for quantization because small changes have small effects in differentiable mathematical functions.
6. User "blstnc" comments with a sarcastic remark about the discussion.
7. User "xrd" questions the significance of the missing mental model and suggests that the difference in representation and cost between GPU and CPU storage may be the primary reason for not using floating-point values.
8. User "wlg" brings up Elon Musk's statement about using int8 training for Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) system.
9. User "gnzl" argues that high precision is needed in touch interactions, mentioning that it is necessary for precise positioning.

The discussion mainly revolves around the benefits and limitations of using reduced precision in training language models, with users sharing their thoughts, opinions, and providing additional information or examples related to the topic.

### Show HN: GPT-4 vision utilities to browse the web

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/reworkd/tarsier) | 8 points | by [asim-shrestha](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=asim-shrestha) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38234305)

Reworkd has released an open-source utility library called Tarsier, designed to help automate web interactions. Tarsier is specifically targeted at multimodal web agents, such as agents that combine natural language processing with vision capabilities. The library allows users to visually "tag" interactable elements on a webpage, providing a mapping between elements and identifiers for the agent to take actions on. Tarsier also includes OCR utilities that can convert a screenshot of a webpage into a text representation that can be understood by agents without vision capabilities. The library currently supports Google Cloud Vision, with plans to add support for other OCR services in the future. Tarsier is available on GitHub under the MIT license.

The discussion on this submission mainly revolves around the README of Tarsier not accurately reflecting the mentioned features. One user points out that the README states that the library supports Google OCR, while the OpenAI API key makes more sense in the context of GPT-4 version. Another user suggests that the Google OCR should convert the screenshot into whitespace-structured text, which would be more useful for multimodal language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4V. The original submitter thanks for the feedback and promises to clarify the information.

### Met Police Scans Almost 250k Faces Using Facial Recognition Technology in 2023

#### [Submission URL](https://bylinetimes.com/2023/11/10/revealed-met-police-scans-almost-quarter-of-a-million-faces-using-facial-recognition-technology-in-2023/) | 43 points | by [BerislavLopac](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=BerislavLopac) | [8 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38228709)

The Metropolitan Police in London has scanned nearly a quarter of a million faces using live facial recognition (LFR) software in 2023, according to Freedom of Information requests filed by Byline Times. The LFR system automatically scans the faces of passers-by and matches them against a watchlist. The Met took several months to respond to the FOI request, which revealed it had scanned an estimated 247,764 faces in 2023 during 13 deployments across London, resulting in just 12 arrests. Civil liberties groups and MPs have criticized the use of LFR, saying it is incompatible with human rights and has a chilling effect on freedom of speech. The use of LFR technology is currently being banned by the EU, but officers in London are continuing to use it.

The discussion surrounding the submission includes various perspectives on the use of live facial recognition (LFR) technology by the Metropolitan Police in London. One commenter, mb5, points out that the director of intelligence for the Met immediately deletes pixelated images. Others, such as adhesive_wombat, criticize the extensive surveillance and lack of regulatory oversight, suggesting that policing should focus on areas like schools, roads, and healthcare rather than using expensive AI systems. YuccaGloriosa suggests deleting the images once their purpose is fulfilled. InCityDreams mentions that face masks, which have become more common recently due to COVID-19, make LFR less effective in public spaces like shopping centers and road intersections. Finally, k1ns expresses surprise at the low number of arrests despite the large number of faces scanned.
