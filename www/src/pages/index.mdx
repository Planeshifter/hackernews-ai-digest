In a recent article from The Intrinsic Perspective, the author takes a critical look at the current state of AI and its potential impact on industries. The article highlights Google's recently unveiled AI model, Gemini, which was showcased in a video demonstrating its abilities to interact with a questioner in real-time. However, the author argues that this video was staged, with pre-recorded frames sent to Gemini for a response. This leads to the larger point that the AI industry relies heavily on hype and large investments, but the industries they are disrupting are not necessarily lucrative. The article questions the audience for the GPT Store, a platform for AI apps, and suggests that the use cases mentioned, such as writing essays or digital art, may not generate significant profits. The author concludes by stating that while AI models like Gemini may be impressive in their capabilities, the industries they are disrupting may not offer substantial returns on investment.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around various aspects of the article. Here are some key points raised by the commenters:

1. The first commenter agrees with the article that many people do not fully realize the impact of language models (LLMs) on businesses. They highlight how LLMs can handle classification and structuring tasks that would otherwise require thousands of human hours.
2. Another commenter elaborates on their experience using LLMs for helpdesk support and points out that while the approach may not always work perfectly, it can enhance productivity for support agents.
3. Some commenters express agreement with the article's critique of the hype around AI and its potential impact on industries. They argue that AI models like ChatGPT may not completely replace current systems and that the current interface of ChatGPT is marketed as a replacement for Google, which is hard to achieve.
4. The discussion also touches upon the potential disruption caused by LLMs in various industries. Examples mentioned include government contractors and junior analysts in the market research industry.
5. There is a debate on the accuracy and reliability of LLMs in tasks such as classification and combating spam. Some commenters highlight the limitations and false outputs of LLMs, while others discuss approaches and solutions to improve their performance.
6. One commenter emphasizes the psychological mechanism of stochastic parroting, where LLMs mimic and respond randomly like a parrot. They argue that LLMs cannot fully replace human judgement and experience.
7. The discussion also includes concerns about the AI industry being in a bubble and the potential negative effects if it bursts. Commenters express skepticism about the potential long-term impact of AI and its underlying technology.
8. Lastly, there are arguments about the role of software-based technologies in creating and bursting bubbles. Some commenters question the feasibility of preventing bubbles and whether technological advancements can deliver substantial promises.
