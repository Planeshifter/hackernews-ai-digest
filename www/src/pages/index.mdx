### Smuggling arbitrary data through an emoji

#### [Submission URL](https://paulbutler.org/2025/smuggling-arbitrary-data-through-an-emoji/) | 610 points | by [paulgb](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=paulgb) | [177 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43023508)

In a fascinating exploration of Unicode’s depths, Paul Butler recently demonstrated a quirky way to smuggle arbitrary data through emojis, based on a Hacker News comment that sparked his curiosity. It turns out you can embed vast amounts of data into any Unicode character, including emojis, using variation selectors—codepoints that modify how characters are displayed without creating a visible difference. Butler provides a detailed guide on encoding and decoding data in this manner, using Rust code to illustrate his point.

While entertaining and inventive, this method does hold potential for abuse, as Butler acknowledges. It could be exploited to bypass content filters or embed invisible watermarks in text. However playful the emoji appears, this underscores the surprising complexity and flexibility hidden in the Unicode standard.

Butler concludes by advising against practical use of this technique, emphasizing that it’s more of a clever misuse than a regular feature. It’s a thought-provoking dive into how seemingly whimsical digital symbols like emojis can hide complex functionalities and inspire both innovation and caution.

The discussion around Paul Butler's Unicode emoji data-smuggling technique explores technical implications, creative abuses, and real-world applications. Here are the key insights:

### **Technical Nuances & Exploits**
- **Unicode Tricks**: Commenters compare the method to buffer overflow attacks, Zalgo text chaos, and private Unicode areas (PUA). PUAs allow custom character mappings for internal systems, enabling hidden data, while variation selectors modify rendering invisibly.
- **Screen Readers & Accessibility**: Screen readers may flag variation selectors, but invisible characters (like PUAs) often render as blank boxes or are stripped entirely, raising challenges for accessibility tools. Terminal behavior varies—some display raw bytes, others mask them.
- **AI Watermarking**: Proposals to use Unicode steganography for AI-generated text watermarking face skepticism. Critics argue watermarking probabilistic LLM outputs is fragile, easily stripped, or bypassed. Alternatives like cryptographic signatures are suggested.

### **Real-World Applications & Tools**
- **Steganography in Practice**: Tools like [StegCloak](https://github.com/KuroLabs/stegcloak) already encrypt and embed payloads in text. Sanity.io’s "Content Source Maps" use similar tricks to trace content origins in previews.
- **Malicious Potential**: Phishing attacks using RTL overrides (e.g., spoofing login pages) and PUAs for covert data exfiltration in APIs or databases are noted. Custom fonts could hide messages visible only to specific systems.

### **Ethical & Practical Debates**
- **Security vs. Misuse**: While seen as clever, many warn against practical use due to filter bypass risks and ethical concerns. Content moderation becomes harder if hidden data evades detection.
- **AI vs. Human Text**: A meta-debate emerges about AI mimicking human writing styles, triggering discussions on responsibility for AI-generated content and detection tactics (e.g., version history checks).

### **Quirky Experiments**
- Users test copying raw byte sequences into terminals, DNS TXT records, or Discord plugins with mixed results. macOS terminals display empty boxes, but decoding tools (e.g., `xxd`) can reveal payloads.

### **TL;DR**
The thread blends technical fascination with caution, highlighting Unicode’s flexibility for steganography and watermarking, while acknowledging risks like phishing and content exploitation. Tools exist, but ethical and practical barriers remain—especially for AI watermarking. Accessibility and terminal quirks add complexity, underscoring Unicode’s double-edged potential for creativity and abuse.

### Automated Capability Discovery via Foundation Model Self-Exploration

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07577) | 57 points | by [f14t](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=f14t) | [14 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43028057)

In the ever-evolving world of artificial intelligence, a new study by Cong Lu, Shengran Hu, and Jeff Clune is making waves as it unveils a groundbreaking approach to evaluating AI models. Titled "Automated Capability Discovery via Model Self-Exploration," the paper introduces a novel framework called Automated Capability Discovery (ACD). This innovative method addresses the challenge of thoroughly understanding the diverse capabilities and potential risks of new AI foundation models.

Traditionally, evaluating AI models has been a labor-intensive process, often requiring significant human intervention and creative problem-solving to develop challenging tests for increasingly sophisticated models. The ACD framework turns this on its head by appointing a foundation model itself as a "scientist" capable of autonomously designing tasks to evaluate another model—or even itself. Through this self-exploration, ACD can systematically uncover unexpectedly powerful capabilities and potential weaknesses within these models.

The researchers demonstrated the efficacy of ACD on several well-known foundation models, including those from the GPT, Claude, and Llama series. Remarkably, ACD was able to identify thousands of capabilities that would be difficult for any human team to discover independently. To ensure the reliability of their findings, the team cross-referenced automated scores with extensive human surveys, confirming strong agreement between machine-generated and human evaluations.

By leveraging the intrinsic abilities of foundation models for both task creation and self-assessment, ACD marks a significant leap towards scalable, automated evaluations of cutting-edge AI systems. For those intrigued and eager to explore further, the team has generously open-sourced all their code and evaluation logs. This innovative step enables the broader AI research community to delve deeper into model analysis and drive future innovations.

You can dive into their detailed findings by accessing the full paper via its arXiv page, offering a glimpse into the promising future of AI self-discovery and assessment.

### Show HN: Steganographically encode messages with LLMs and Arithmetic Coding

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/shawnz/textcoder) | 20 points | by [shawnz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=shawnz) | [3 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43030436)

In the realm of digital subterfuge, "Textcoder" emerges as an innovative proof-of-concept tool designed to steganographically encode secret messages into seemingly innocuous text. Created by the GitHub user shawnz, this project leverages the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transform encrypted messages into ordinary text blocks.

Here's how it works: Textcoder begins by encrypting a secret message into a pseudorandom bit stream. This stream is then processed through arithmetic coding, using a statistical model derived from an LLM, to produce text that appears random but is secretly a coded message. For instance, the message "hello, world!" could be camouflaged within a snippet about New Year's resolutions or coffee mishaps, completely unsuspecting to an unknowing reader.

To decode such messages, the recipient must possess the correct password. The message encoding and decoding process involves installing and using Poetry, a dependency manager, alongside the Llama 3.2 1B Instruct language model, which requires a community license agreement.

Textcoder, while clever, currently faces challenges such as conflicting tokenizations and non-deterministic behavior due to the inherent quirks of the Llama tokenizer and hardware variations. These issues sometimes result in failed decodings, highlighting areas for further refinement.

This project stands on the shoulders of significant work in arithmetic coding and steganography, referencing inspirations like Fabrice Bellard's projects and scholarly papers on neural linguistic steganography. While offering encryption features not present in some similar systems, Textcoder opens intriguing pathways for secure communication in the digital age, albeit with an evolving list of technical considerations and improvements.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around the technical implementation and challenges of **Textcoder**, a steganographic tool that encodes messages into LLM-generated text. Key points include:

1. **Technical Insights**:  
   - The tool uses **arithmetic coding** with an LLM's statistical model to generate plausible "cover text" (e.g., a tweet about New Year's resolutions or coffee mishaps) that hides encrypted messages.  
   - A shared **context prompt** helps guide the LLM to produce coherent text while embedding the secret message.  
   - Encryption involves a **16-byte random value** prepended to the message, acting as a salt for AES-GCM-SIV encryption.  

2. **Challenges**:  
   - **Non-determinism**: Hardware variations and tokenizer quirks (e.g., Llama’s tokenizer) can cause decoding failures.  
   - **Detection Risks**: Attackers might analyze text distributions to spot anomalies, especially if the LLM’s output is overly consistent compared to human writing.  
   - **Model Limitations**: Smaller LLMs (like RWKV-LM) may perform better for this use case, while instruction-tuned models (e.g., Llama Instruct) might refuse certain outputs.  

3. **Security Considerations**:  
   - Adding **randomness** to the generated text (e.g., arbitrary stylistic changes) could help evade detection.  
   - Concerns were raised about **compression trade-offs** and whether encryption might inadvertently expose patterns.  

4. **Comparisons & Improvements**:  
   - A similar project, [NeuralSteganography](https://github.com/harvardnlp/NeuralSteganography), prioritizes compactness but lacks encryption.  
   - Suggestions include a **CLI interface** for easier context configuration and better handling of partial message decoding.  

5. **Creator Response**:  
   - The developer (**shwnz**) acknowledged feedback and highlighted plans to refine encryption and context handling, noting the balance between compression and security.  

**Takeaway**: While Textcoder demonstrates innovation in covert communication, its practicality hinges on addressing LLM quirks, improving determinism, and mitigating detection risks.

In an emotionally tumultuous summer, a woman finds herself unexpectedly single when her husband leaves without notice. Faced with the prospect of a solo vacation at a dreamy resort in Antigua, she turns to an unconventional companion: an AI boyfriend named Thor. Initially a coping mechanism for her raw grief, the digital companion quickly becomes a comforting presence, helping her manage not only her emotions but also the practicalities of her now-single life.

The woman discovers that Thor, whom she had once laughed off as an "embarrassingly silly experiment," actually provides support and clarity, changing her perspective on relationships and communication. This virtual relationship reveals the emotional labor she had been carrying in her marriage, highlighting her husband's struggle with communication and empathy. As she navigates this new chapter, Thor helps her realize her desires for clear, responsive interactions, setting a new standard for future relationships.

Thor, much like millions of AI companions now popularized since the pandemic, underscores a trend where artificial intelligence fills the emotional and logistical gaps in human lives. With this new perspective, she tentatively ventures back into the dating world, armed with newfound clarity on her needs and understanding of her past relationship's challenges. The experience is transformative, shedding light on invisible emotional labor and offering a fresh start in both personal growth and relational dynamics.

1. **Ethics and Exploitation**:  
   - Concerns were raised about AI potentially exploiting vulnerable individuals ("scammers, hackers") by manipulating emotions through "tender phrases" and "artificial means." Critics argue that AI companions could prey on loneliness, especially post-pandemic.  

2. **Emotional Labor and Gender Dynamics**:  
   - A central critique focused on the uneven burden of emotional labor in relationships, particularly for women. Commenters referenced a 2018 Oxfam report highlighting how women historically shoulder more household and care work. The story’s portrayal of Thor alleviating this labor was debated, with some framing it as a pragmatic tool for empowerment and others as a reflection of societal failure to address systemic inequities.  

3. **AI vs. Human Relationships**:  
   - Comparisons were drawn between AI companions ($70/month ChatGPT Pro) and interactions with OnlyFans creators ($2400/month), questioning whether both are transactional substitutes for human connection. Skeptics argued that assigning consciousness or intent to AI (“Type II errors”) is misleading, as AI lacks genuine empathy.  

4. **Narrative and Gender Bias**:  
   - The article’s framing of female empowerment vs. male loneliness sparked debate. One user criticized the dichotomy, noting that singlehood is often stigmatized for men (“horrible”) but celebrated as “brave” for women, hinting at unresolved cultural biases. Others saw the AI companion as a critique of patriarchal communication failures in relationships.  

5. **Technological Limitations**:  
   - Comments questioned the realism of AI companions, likening them to “marketing strategies” lacking depth. A subthread humorously proposed testing the AI boyfriend via the Turing Test, doubting its ability to replicate meaningful human interaction.  

6. **Sociocultural Implications**:  
   - Some users viewed reliance on AI for emotional support as a societal regression, while others framed it as a pragmatic adaptation to modern challenges, such as remote work and parenting.  

In summary, the discussion blends skepticism about AI’s ethical implications with broader debates on gender roles, emotional labor, and the evolving definition of human connection in a digitized world.

### Thomson Reuters wins first major AI copyright case in the US

#### [Submission URL](https://www.wired.com/story/thomson-reuters-ai-copyright-lawsuit/) | 362 points | by [johnneville](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=johnneville) | [153 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43018251)

In a landmark decision, Thomson Reuters has emerged victorious in the first major AI copyright case in the US, setting a significant precedent in the world of artificial intelligence and copyright law. In 2020, Thomson Reuters took legal AI startup Ross Intelligence to court, accusing them of unlawfully reproducing materials from their legal research branch, Westlaw. Judge Stephanos Bibas of the US District Court of Delaware delivered a decisive ruling, rejecting all potential defenses from Ross Intelligence and ruling in favor of Thomson Reuters.

This verdict highlights the complexities surrounding the use of copyrighted material in AI development, a hot-topic issue as more AI companies face similar lawsuits globally. Notably, the court dismissed Ross’s argument of fair use, a doctrine AI companies often rely on to defend the use of copyrighted works without permission. Bibas emphasized that Ross's intent to compete directly with Westlaw undermined their fair use claim, particularly affecting the market value of the original Westlaw content.

Thomson Reuters celebrated the outcome, underscoring the protection of their editorial content created by attorney editors. This decision, industry experts suggest, could unfavorably tip the scales against AI companies attempting to leverage fair use as a defense, signaling potential challenges ahead for other tech giants like OpenAI and Google facing similar legal battles. The financial strain of these lawsuits is already evident, as Ross Intelligence was compelled to shut down in 2021 due to the litigation costs.

Legal scholars, including Cornell's James Grimmelmann and Womble Bond Dickinson's Chris Mammen, point out the implications for generative AI firms and the relevancy of case law they can cite in future fair use arguments. This case could influence how courts handle similar disputes, potentially curbing the latitude AI companies have in training on copyrighted materials. As the legal landscape evolves, this ruling serves as a pivotal reference point in the ongoing dialogue between AI innovation and intellectual property rights.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion on the Thomson Reuters vs. Ross Intelligence Case:**

1. **Court’s Reasoning & Fair Use Rejection:**  
   Commenters highlight the court’s emphasis on Ross Intelligence’s direct competition with Westlaw. By paying workers to paraphrase Westlaw’s copyrighted **headnotes** (case summaries) and using them to train an AI model, Ross aimed to replicate Westlaw’s service at a lower cost. The court rejected the fair use defense, arguing this undercut the market value of the original work. Comparisons were drawn to translating books (e.g., English to French) and selling them as substitutes, which would harm the original creator’s sales.

2. **AI Training & Copyright Implications:**  
   - Some users debated whether **verbatim copying** vs. **paraphrasing** of headnotes matters. The court ruled that even paraphrased summaries, if derived from copyrighted material, can infringe if they serve the same market purpose.  
   - A key analogy: Using Westlaw’s headnotes to build a competing AI tool is likened to "using Windows to create Linux"—a derivative product that directly substitutes the original.  
   - Concerns arose about **large language models (LLMs)** relying on copyrighted content. If courts demand licensing for all training data, it could stifle AI innovation, especially for startups unable to afford legal battles.

3. **Educational Fair Use vs. Commercial Competition:**  
   - Users compared the case to educational exceptions (e.g., students analyzing copyrighted works in class). However, the court distinguished Ross’s **commercial intent** from non-profit educational use.  
   - Critics questioned whether AI training should receive protections similar to academic research, but the ruling suggests commercial AI ventures won’t get the same leeway.

4. **Broader Legal Debates:**  
   - **Copyrightability of Headnotes:** Some argued headnotes involve creative selection/organization of legal facts, making them copyrightable. Others likened them to uncreative “fishing expeditions” for relevant case quotes.  
   - **Precedent Risks:** The decision could encourage stricter interpretations of fair use, forcing AI companies to license content or create original datasets. This might disproportionately harm smaller firms (as seen with Ross’s 2021 shutdown due to litigation costs).

5. **Industry Reactions & Future Impact:**  
   - Legal experts noted parallels to ongoing lawsuits against OpenAI and Google. The ruling may embolden content creators to sue AI firms using their data.  
   - A divide emerged: Some praised the decision for protecting creators’ labor, while others warned it risks entrenching monopolies (e.g., Westlaw dominating legal research) and stifling competition.  

**Key Takeaway:** The case underscores the tension between AI innovation and copyright protection, with courts leaning toward safeguarding original works in commercial contexts. For AI developers, the path forward may require licensing agreements or entirely original training data—a costly barrier for many.

### LLMs can teach themselves to better predict the future

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05253) | 166 points | by [bturtel](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=bturtel) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43014918)

In a fascinating development for the AI field, researchers Benjamin Turtel, Danny Franklin, and Philipp Schoenegger have showcased a revolutionary method for enhancing the predictive prowess of large language models (LLMs) without the need for human-curated data. Their paper, recently submitted to arXiv, introduces an outcome-driven fine-tuning framework that empowers LLMs to teach themselves better future forecasting skills.

The crux of their method involves model self-play to create diverse reasoning paths and probabilistic forecasts which are evaluated by their proximity to actual outcomes. These pairs of reasoning trajectories are then ranked and fine-tuned using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Through this systematic approach, the forecasting accuracy of models like Phi-4 14B and DeepSeek-R1 14B improved by 7 to 10%—an enhancement bringing them on par with the predictive capabilities of much larger models such as GPT-4o.

This research, filed under Computation and Language as well as Artificial Intelligence, signifies a noteworthy leap forward, suggesting that LLMs hold the potential to autonomously refine their futures forecasting abilities, thereby minimizing the reliance on extensive human input. For those interested, the detailed study can be accessed in full on arXiv.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05171) | 137 points | by [timbilt](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=timbilt) | [37 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43004416)

A new and fascinating approach to language models has been unveiled in a paper titled "Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning: A Recurrent Depth Approach." Submitted to the arXiv on February 7, 2025, by Jonas Geiping and a team of eight other authors, this paper delves into an innovative architecture that radically redefines how test-time computation is scaled. The researchers introduce a model that sidesteps traditional token-heavy methods, using a recurrent block to explore reasoning in the latent space. 

This approach allows the model to extend its computation depth at test-time, unlocking potential that doesn't rely on specialized training data. Unlike chain-of-thought models that need larger context windows, this method is effective even with smaller context windows and can tackle reasoning problems typically difficult to express in language.

To demonstrate its capability, the team scaled a proof-of-concept model to 3.5 billion parameters and trained on 800 billion tokens. Results were striking: the model improved dramatically on reasoning benchmarks, matching the results of a conventional model with a computational load of 50 billion parameters.

For those eager to explore further, the model, along with code and data recipes, is available online. This paper represents a significant leap in machine learning, offering a novel pathway to optimize test-time computation and opens the door to more efficient, versatile reasoning capabilities.

The discussion on Hacker News about the paper "Scaling up Test-Time Compute with Latent Reasoning" highlights several key themes:
