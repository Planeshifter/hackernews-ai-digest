### Binary vector embeddings are so cool

#### [Submission URL](https://emschwartz.me/binary-vector-embeddings-are-so-cool/) | 75 points | by [emschwartz](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=emschwartz) | [10 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42107196)

In a recent post that has captivated Hacker News, the impressive capabilities of binary quantized vector embeddings are brought to the forefront. These embeddings compress data up to 32 times while maintaining over 95% accuracy in retrieval and achieving around 25 times faster performance compared to traditional methods.

So, what exactly are embeddings? They transform text into numerical representations, allowing for efficient searches of semantically similar content. Typically, these embeddings use 32-bit floating point numbers, but binary quantization converts these to single bits—mapping positive weights to '1' and negative weights to '0'. This innovative technique not only reduces the size of the embeddings significantly, but it also retains a remarkable amount of information, providing high retrieval accuracy using Hamming distance instead of cosine similarity.

The article highlights findings from a blog post co-authored by MixedBread.ai and HuggingFace, illustrating that the binary quantized embeddings can shrink the original embedding size to just 3.125% with minimal loss in performance—making it akin to JPEG compression for images. Additionally, it explores a method known as Matryoshka embeddings, which arranges information hierarchically within the vector, allowing for further efficient dimension reduction.

Combining binary quantization with Matryoshka embeddings allows for even greater compression. For instance, achieving a 90.76% accuracy with an embedding only 1.56% the size of the original is nothing short of astounding. Beyond storage savings, these binary embeddings also dramatically speed up distance calculations, making them a game changer for computational efficiency.

The author shares a personal anecdote about transitioning to MixedBread's model for building a personalized content feed, reflecting the real-world impact of this technology. As the field of machine learning continues to evolve, techniques like these are set to revolutionize how we handle and process large datasets.
