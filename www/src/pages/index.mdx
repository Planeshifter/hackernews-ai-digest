The discussion around bias in ML/AI models continues to be a hot topic, with recent examples highlighting the challenges faced in addressing biases inherent in language models and generative AI. One noteworthy incident involved Playground AI (PAI) generating a professional LinkedIn profile photo by transforming an Asian woman's face to that of a white woman with blue eyes, sparking debate on bias in AI outputs.

The reaction to such incidents varies, with some dismissing them as not indicative of bias. Critics point out that models often exhibit skewed representations, such as an overabundance of Asian faces in certain datasets, leading to skewed outputs. Playground AI's CEO defended the model's output, likening it to a single dice roll and questioning the assumption of bias based on a singular result.

Further investigations revealed similar bias patterns in other prompts, where the model consistently favored white and stereotypical representations across various professions and ethnicities. These findings underscore the systemic issue of bias prevalent in many AI systems, including those deployed by major tech companies.

The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of addressing bias in AI models to ensure fair and accurate outcomes. It highlights the need for thorough checks and safeguards to mitigate biases and promote inclusivity in AI technologies.

The concept of intelligence is a complex and ever-evolving one, especially when considering the wide array of creatures on Earth. From slime molds to fifth-graders, from shrimp to border collies, what truly defines intelligence? Abigail Desmond and Michael Haslam dive into this subject, challenging the notion of intelligence as a single, measurable entity and suggesting that it is a label we use to categorize a variety of traits that have helped different species thrive.

They argue that intelligence is a relative concept, existing only in relation to human expectations and evolving over time. While humans often associate intelligence with our evolutionary success, many other species have thrived without what we traditionally consider intelligent behavior. The authors propose that intelligence is a human construct that we project onto the world around us, leading to unexpected discoveries of intelligence in unexpected places.

In a world where intelligence is sought after in romantic partners, pets, leaders, and even AI programs, understanding and defining intelligence remains a challenge. The diversity of ways in which different species survive and thrive challenges our preconceived notions of intelligence, urging us to think beyond our human-centric view of the world.

The discussion on Hacker News revolves around the concept of intelligence and its different facets:

1. Users discuss the complexity of defining Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and its specific cognitive capabilities, relating this to the challenges in AI research.
2. Recommendations are made for reading "A Brief History of Intelligence" and the books "Children of Time" and "Blindsight."
3. The conversation delves into the portrayal of intelligence in different species, such as Portia Spiders and the parallel drawn to female dominance in society.
4. Connections are made between "Deepness in the Sky" and "Blindsight" in terms of storytelling techniques.
5. References are shared regarding BEAM Robotics and the exploration of consciousness and copyright in thought experiments.
6. The discussion extends to thought experiments exploring consciousness in simulated environments, with references to related works by Greg Egan and philosophical arguments about consciousness in robots akin to zombies.

Overall, the comments showcase a deep dive into various aspects of intelligence, consciousness, literature recommendations, and philosophical musings related to the topic.

### Stable Diffusion 3 banned on CivitAI due to license
