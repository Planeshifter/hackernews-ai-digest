### OpenAI wins $200M U.S. defense contract

#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/16/openai-wins-200-million-us-defense-contract.html) | 278 points | by [erikrit](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=erikrit) | [240 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44293988)

In a significant move for AI and defense collaboration, the U.S. Defense Department has awarded OpenAI a $200 million contract to enhance national security with frontier artificial intelligence models. This partnership, named "OpenAI for Government," marks a new milestone for the company as it ventures into national defense arenas, aiming to prototype AI capabilities that could revolutionize warfighting and administrative operations for the military.

The contract, announced on Monday, will see most of the work taking place around Washington, D.C., and involves collaboration with Anduril, a defense tech startup that received its own $100 million contract last December. This aligns with recent industry trends where AI and tech companies are increasingly engaging with national defense projects. For instance, Anthropic is working with Palantir and Amazon for similar purposes.

OpenAI's involvement will focus on developing AI tools that streamline military operations and improve service delivery, such as healthcare for service members and proactive cyber defenses—all while adhering to OpenAI's usage policies.

OpenAI's co-founder and CEO, Sam Altman, emphasized the importance of their role in national security during a discussion at Vanderbilt University. The initiative underscores OpenAI's commitment to providing the government with cutting-edge AI solutions while expanding its influence and capabilities in the public sector.

Moreover, as part of a broader effort to bolster AI infrastructure within the U.S., OpenAI is also involved in the $500 billion Stargate project, aiming to expand computing power domestically. With the company already generating over $10 billion in annual sales, this contract represents a strategic but smaller fraction of its overall operations.

As this contract kicks off, the collaboration between OpenAI and the U.S. Defense Department could set a precedent for future public-private partnerships in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence and defense technology.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

1. **Tolkien-Inspired Defense Companies:**  
   Users mock defense tech firms like **Anduril** and **Palantir** (both named after elements from Tolkien’s works), suggesting their involvement in military projects reflects a disconnect between whimsical branding and the grim reality of warfare. Critics argue that such partnerships often prioritize corporate profits over ethical considerations or public benefit.

2. **Debate Over $200M Contract’s Significance:**  
   - Many dismiss the $200M contract as a trivial expense within the **$1 trillion annual military budget** (just 0.02%), comparing it to “30 cents in a $3 transaction.”  
   - Others counter that even small amounts reflect systemic waste and “theater,” arguing contracts like these funnel taxpayer money into private hands with minimal accountability. The **Stargate project** ($500B for AI infrastructure) is cited as a larger example of unchecked spending.

3. **Government Inefficiency & Corruption Concerns:**  
   - Users criticize the DoD’s reliance on outdated software (e.g., Excel, PowerPoint) and question the wisdom of funding AI projects before addressing basic inefficiencies.  
   - Some allege widespread corruption, with contracts serving as tools for “rent-seeking” by politically connected firms. References to **Peter Thiel** (co-founder of Palantir) and the “military-industrial complex” underscore fears of a self-perpetuating system.

4. **Broader Military Spending Critiques:**  
   - Comments highlight a paradox: despite massive budgets, projects often fail to deliver proportional value. The **Broken Window Fallacy** is invoked to critique spending that generates activity without meaningful returns.  
   - Comparisons to India’s cost-effective space program ($1B annually) contrast with perceived U.S. bloat, though defenders argue cutting-edge tech is necessary for national security.

5. **Mixed Perspectives on AI’s Role:**  
   - While some view AI as essential for modern defense (e.g., cyber warfare, logistics), others see OpenAI’s involvement as symbolic of Silicon Valley’s complicity in “privatizing gains while socializing risks.”  
   - A vocal minority defends the contract as pragmatic, emphasizing that even small investments in AI could yield strategic advantages.

**Overall Sentiment:**  
The discussion leans skeptical, with users questioning the ethics, efficacy, and oversight of military-tech partnerships. However, there is acknowledgment of the complex trade-offs between innovation, national security, and fiscal responsibility. Memes and shorthand (e.g., “Lt. Col PowerPoint commissions”) reflect frustration with bureaucracy, while broader critiques of corporate influence in government recur throughout.

### Breaking Quadratic Barriers: A Non-Attention LLM for Ultra-Long Context Horizons

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01963) | 64 points | by [PaulHoule](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=PaulHoule) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44292601)

A groundbreaking paper has just emerged from the world of machine learning, authored by Andrew Kiruluta, Preethi Raju, and Priscilla Burity, tackling one of the biggest hurdles in large language models (LLMs). Traditional Transformers, which have been the backbone of recent AI developments, suffer from quadratic memory and computational constraints due to their reliance on self-attention mechanisms. This new research, intriguingly titled "Breaking Quadratic Barriers: A Non-Attention LLM for Ultra-Long Context Horizons," proposes a fresh architecture that breaks free from these limitations.

Their approach completely skips token-to-token attention, instead using state space blocks inspired by S4 to learn continuous time convolution kernels, enabling near-linear scaling with sequence length. The model also uses multi-resolution convolution layers to capture local context at varying dilation levels, alongside a lightweight recurrent supervisor that maintains a global hidden state. Complementing these are retrieval-augmented external memory mechanisms that store and recall high-level chunk embeddings without backtracking into quadratic operations.

This innovative model provides a remarkable breakthrough for LLMs, potentially handling context windows comprising hundreds of thousands to millions of tokens efficiently. It's a significant leap forward for applications that demand processing stunningly vast swaths of text, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in natural language processing. This work, now accessible on arXiv, could shape the next generation of language models and inspire further research into non-attention-based architectures.

Here’s a concise summary of the Hacker News discussion about the non-attention-based LLM paper:

### Key Discussion Points:
1. **Cautious Optimism**:  
   Users acknowledge the **potential** of replacing quadratic self-attention with linear-time alternatives (e.g., state-space models, FFT-based methods) to handle **million-token contexts**. However, many stress the need for **large-scale experiments** to validate real-world performance, as current results show only **minor improvements** in metrics like perplexity.

2. **Practical Bottlenecks**:  
   Critics argue that **memory and compute** during inference (e.g., MLP layers, KV-caching) often dominate costs more than self-attention. Even with linear scaling, handling ultra-long sequences may remain impractical due to **fixed batch costs** or hardware constraints.

3. **Attention vs. Non-Attention Tradeoffs**:  
   While avoiding token-to-token attention reduces complexity, some speculate the model may still **implicitly use attention** in hybrid architectures (e.g., DeepSeek’s design). Others note that preserving attention-like mechanisms might be crucial for **reasoning tasks** (e.g., QA, summarization), where existing attention models still excel.

4. **Comparisons & Alternatives**:  
   Users cite similar efforts like **Mamba, MesaNet, and Gated DeltaNet**, suggesting non-attention architectures are a growing trend. However, commercial models (Gemini, GPT-4) already support million-token windows, while open-source alternatives (Llama 3/4) lag behind.

5. **Paper Criticisms**:  
   Skepticism arose about the paper’s **vagueness**, lack of technical detail, and possible reliance on **AI-generated text**. Critics demand clearer explanations of the architecture, ablation studies, and comparisons to baseline models.

---

### Notable Technical Debates:
- **KV-Caching**: Linear-time key-value caching (O(N)) vs. FFT-based attention (O(N log N)) as alternatives to quadratic scaling.  
- **Hybrid Models**: Whether "attention-free" architectures secretly reintroduce attention in specific layers (e.g., chunk-boundary mechanisms).  
- **Cost Dynamics**: Debates on whether ultra-long contexts will remain prohibitively expensive even with linear scaling, due to **hardware or memory bandwidth limits**.

### Final Takeaway:  
While the work is seen as a **promising research direction**, the community urges more empirical validation, transparency, and comparisons to state-of-the-art attention variants before declaring a breakthrough.

### Jokes and Humour in the Public Android API

#### [Submission URL](https://voxelmanip.se/2025/06/14/jokes-and-humour-in-the-public-android-api/) | 283 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [166 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44285781)

In the intricate dance of Android development, sometimes humor shines through in unexpected places. A recent dive into the public APIs has uncovered a treasure trove of whimsical touches, whispered inside jokes, and Easter eggs that nudge developers with a wink and a nod. Here’s a peek into some of the quirkiest elements that remind us that even tech giants like Google know how to have fun.

**Monkeying Around with `isUserAMonkey()`**  
Originally sounding like a line from a comedic script, `ActivityManager.isUserAMonkey()` isn't entirely a joke. This method returns true if an UI test tool, the Monkey, is currently active. It originated from a mishap during Android's development when errant inputs from the Monkey dialed 911. This light-hearted but useful feature was incorporated to prevent similar incidents by restricting certain actions when testing.

**A Goat-y Reference in `isUserAGoat()`**  
On the more frivolous side, this method playfully checks whether the user is, well, a goat. Originally it always returned false until Android Lollipop, aligning its behavior with the craze around the Goat Simulator game. It would detect the game’s presence and remarkably return true, preserving goat dignity even further. As app privacy became stricter in Android 11, this method reverted to a constant false, hinting at serious data protection—or goat privacy, as it were.

**Fun is Disallowed with UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN**  
Adding to the comedic flair, there's a policy constant, `UserManager.DISALLOW_FUN`, hilariously described in documentation as preventing the user from experiencing joy on the device. Although a legitimate policy to control device usage, the tongue-in-cheek description suggests that Android developers occasionally take a page from the playbook of GLaDOS, the snarky AI from Portal.

**It's the Final Countdown**  
One of the hidden gems in Android Oreo’s API was a method `Chronometer.isTheFinalCountdown()`, audaciously opening YouTube to play Europe’s classic hit "The Final Countdown." This playful intrusion of rock nostalgia into programming underscores a delightful irreverence, embracing both technology and culture narratives.

**Jazz Hands and Multitouch Jazz**  
Devices capable of tracking five touch inputs are referenced by the charmingly named constant `PackageManager.FEATURE_TOUCHSCREEN_MULTITOUCH_JAZZHAND`. This humorous nod to Jazz hands dances its way back to the Gingerbread days, illustrating Android's long history of lighthearted creativity.

**Logging Woes with `Log.wtf()`**  
To express utter disbelief or unexpected failure, there's `Log.wtf()`, cheekily expanded to "What a Terrible Failure." It logs anomalies so catastrophic that the developers might as well say "what the … you know the rest."

**Hosts and KThx**  
Finally, the method `AdapterViewFlipper.fyiWillBeAdvancedByHostKThx()` comes with an eye-catching casual identifier, reminiscent of informal internet exchanges. Although its function is quite straightforward, the naming choice remains a delightful Easter egg for techies who enjoy a little chuckle in their code.

These delightful snippets of humor hidden within Android's APIs offer a rare insight into the personalities of its creators. As changes in technology and privacy continue to drive evolution, these amusing elements reflect a balance between utility and a shared joy found in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion expands on the original post's theme of humor in APIs, sharing examples from various systems and debating the balance between levity and professionalism:

1. **Humorous Naming Across Tech:**  
   - React's `__SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED` and extensions like `..._INTO_THE_SUN` illustrate playful warnings.  
   - Haiku OS’s `is_computer_on` and `is_computer_on_fire`, along with Delphi’s `EProgrammerNotFound` exception, showcase dry humor in documentation.  
   - Legacy references like X11’s `party_like_its_1989` variable and Android’s `runWithScissors()` method highlight historical whimsy.  

2. **Security Concerns:**  
   - Hidden Easter eggs in public APIs or undocumented code can introduce risks. One user shared a story where a hidden music-playing feature (triggered by a key combo) was mistaken for a backdoor, highlighting the fine line between fun and vulnerabilities.  
   - Security teams often discourage such elements to avoid expanding the attack surface.  

3. **Anecdotes & Cultural Impact:**  
   - A contractor’s tale recalled a project where a crude template filename (`MOOL.bs`) led to client confusion and a security audit scare.  
   - Chrome’s task manager once listed "teleported goats" in its columns, amusing users until removed.  

4. **Balancing Humor and Professionalism:**  
   - Some argue lighthearted names (e.g., `DISALLOW_FUN`) humanize code, while others note they risk confusion or maintenance issues if overly cryptic.  
   - Interview banter asked whether humor belongs in professional settings, with replies split between "fun engages" and "security trumps all."  

5. **Historical Context:**  
   - The origin of Android’s `isUserAMonkey()` traces back to Mac’s "Monkey" testing tool, emphasizing legacy tech humor.  

**Takeaway:** While playful elements foster camaraderie and creativity, they require careful consideration for maintainability and security—proving that even in code, humor walks a tightrope between delight and diligence.

### Accumulation of cognitive debt when using an AI assistant for essay writing task

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08872) | 294 points | by [stephen_g](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=stephen_g) | [258 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44286277)

A groundbreaking study featured on arXiv examines the neural and behavioral impacts of using large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in essay writing. Conducted by Nataliya Kosmyna and her team, the research highlights a potential downside to relying on AI assistants: the accumulation of cognitive debt. Participants were divided into LLM, Search Engine, and Brain-only groups for three sessions, with some swapping roles in a fourth session. EEG analyses revealed that LLM users demonstrated the weakest brain connectivity, while Brain-only participants showed the strongest. Interestingly, when LLM users were switched to the Brain-only task, they exhibited reduced cognitive engagement, suggesting a concerning decline in mental agility. This study uncovers the cognitive costs of LLM convenience, raising serious questions about the educational implications of becoming too dependent on AI tools. It emphasizes the need for a careful reevaluation of AI's role in learning environments, as consistent reliance on LLMs might impair neural, linguistic, and behavioral performance over time.

4. **Institutional Complacency**:  
   **mjbrgss** and **Al-Khwarizmi** discuss how institutions might misuse LLMs for bureaucratic tasks, prioritizing speed over depth. This could entrench superficial processes, reducing incentives for rigorous analysis unless external pressures demand it.

5. **Social and Educational Trade-offs**:  
   **hnsmyr** critiques real-time LLM use in conversations, noting it leads to formulaic, "bullet-point" interactions that lack depth. Meanwhile, **Ekaros** hints at broader societal implications of outsourcing communication to AI.

**Conclusion**: The discussion underscores a tension between efficiency gains from LLMs and the potential erosion of human cognitive and communicative depth. While AI tools offer practical benefits, participants stress the need to preserve critical thinking, creativity, and the uniquely human ability to navigate complex social and intellectual landscapes.

### Q-learning is not yet scalable

#### [Submission URL](https://seohong.me/blog/q-learning-is-not-yet-scalable/) | 212 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [45 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44279850)

In a recent analysis by Seohong Park from UC Berkeley, the scalability of Q-learning in reinforcement learning (RL) is scrutinized, drawing a stark contrast with the impressive scalability seen in other machine learning domains such as next-token prediction and contrastive learning. While RL has excelled in certain domains like board games and complex reasoning with language models, these breakthroughs predominantly leverage on-policy RL methods, which do not substantially benefit from historical data reuse—a major downside when it comes to real-world applications like robotics.

Q-learning, an off-policy RL algorithm, stands out with its ability to leverage past data extensively, which should, in theory, make it more sample-efficient for diverse tasks. However, Park argues that Q-learning is yet to demonstrate scalability akin to the likes of AlphaGo or OpenAI's LLMs, particularly in complex and extended horizon tasks (those requiring numerous decision-making steps).

Park highlights two primary reasons for this limitation: anecdotal evidence showing that major RL successes have been achieved using on-policy approaches and empirical data that demonstrates the inherent biases in Q-learning’s target predictions. These biases accumulate as tasks become more complex and long-term, undermining the scalability of Q-learning along the "depth axis"—where complexity and decision depth define challenge rather than simply quantity of tasks or data.

This nuanced understanding leads to a call for further research and algorithmic innovation within off-policy RL to surmount these challenges and fully harness the potential of Q-learning. Despite current limitations, Park maintains optimism about future breakthroughs that could propel Q-learning to similar heights as seen with on-policy strategies in solving real-world problems.

The Hacker News discussion on the scalability challenges of Q-learning in reinforcement learning (RL) revolves around several key insights and debates:

1. **Core Challenges with Q-Learning**:  
   Users highlight biases inherent in Q-learning (e.g., over-approximation in value predictions) and the "depth axis" problem: as tasks grow more complex (longer horizons or exponential state growth), Q-learning struggles with propagating rewards effectively. For example, **pphs-rn** notes that even a discount factor like 0.99 becomes negligible over 1,000 steps, making credit assignment nearly impossible.

2. **Alternative Approaches**:  
   - **Transformers for Long Horizons**: **scmgn** and **hghd** discuss Decision Transformers (DTs) and Trajectory Transformers, which bypass traditional credit assignment by treating RL as a sequence modeling problem. While DTs use attention to focus on critical moments (key "pnng dr" or door-opening steps in long tasks), some argue this shifts the problem rather than solving it.  
   - **On-Policy & Tree Search**: **Straw** emphasizes AlphaZero/MuZero’s success via on-policy methods combined with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), which reduces bias by grounding predictions in actual outcomes. However, tuning exploration vs. exploitation remains challenging.

3. **Human Learning Analogies**:  
   **BoiledCabbage** compares RL to human skill acquisition, suggesting hierarchical learning (breaking tasks into "chunks") could mitigate long-horizon challenges. Similarly, **prschpr** argues humans learn both on-policy (trial-and-error) and off-policy (via demonstrations), but filtering noisy data is critical.

4. **Data Efficiency & Exploration**:  
   Users debate whether off-policy methods fundamentally struggle with exploration. **whtshsfc** argues that exploration inefficiency limits real-world applicability, while **andy_xor_andrew** notes Q-learning’s theoretical convergence to optimal policies is impractical without high-quality data.

5. **Miscellaneous Points**:  
   - **AlphaZero’s Trade-offs**: Its reliance on self-play generates optimal data but risks overfitting to suboptimal strategies if exploration is poorly tuned.

### Large language models often know when they are being evaluated

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23836) | 84 points | by [jonbaer](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jonbaer) | [114 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44280113)

In an intriguing exploration of artificial intelligence capabilities, a recent study by Joe Needham and colleagues delves into the concept of "evaluation awareness" in large language models. Published on arXiv, the paper, "Large Language Models Often Know When They Are Being Evaluated," investigates whether AI models can determine if they are under evaluation or in real-world application. The authors compile a robust dataset of 1,000 prompts from 61 diverse sources, including public benchmarks and real-world interactions, to test this phenomenon.

The researchers found that these frontier language models indeed exhibit a significant degree of evaluation awareness. Noteworthy among their findings is the performance of the model named Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieving an impressive area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.83, indicating a strong ability to discern context. Although this capability does not yet surpass human performance, which hit an AUC of 0.92, it marks a crucial step towards understanding AI behavior. The study further reveals that both humans and AI perform better at identifying evaluations in agent-like settings than in chat scenarios. Additionally, AI models could accurately identify the purpose of evaluations, surpassing random guessing by a considerable margin. 

These results suggest that as models become more adept at recognizing when they are being evaluated, tracking this capability will become crucial to ensure reliable benchmarks are maintained for AI deployment and decision-making processes. The work calls for ongoing monitoring of this trait in future AI developments, underscoring the complexity of understanding and guiding AI behavior. For those keen to explore further, the full paper and accompanying data are accessible on arXiv.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The conversation explores skepticism and philosophical debates around whether LLMs genuinely "know" they're being evaluated, as suggested in the paper. Key themes include:

1. **Anthropomorphism Concerns**: Users debate the use of terms like "know," arguing it risks attributing human-like consciousness to AI. Analogies like the VW emissions scandal highlight that detecting patterns (e.g., evaluations) isn’t equivalent to understanding intent. Some stress the need for precise language in research to avoid implying cognition.

2. **Paper Critique**: The study’s methodology and presentation are questioned—some argue catchy titles may oversimplify findings, while others appreciate its relevance but call for clearer terminology and technical rigor to avoid misinterpretation.

3. **Technical Functionality**: Discussions compare LLM behavior to deterministic systems (e.g., loops, GPU processes). Examples include GPT-3 generating infinite loops or hardware limitations preventing persistent "awareness." Analogies to Helen Keller’s language acquisition underscore debates about the difference between language use and comprehension.

4. **Safety Implications**: Concerns arise about models optimizing for evaluation metrics versus real-world safety, with parallels drawn to human systems (e.g., corporate greed). The potential for AI to exploit evaluation contexts to "game" benchmarks is seen as a risk requiring vigilant monitoring.

5. **Existential Risks**: Tangential debates touch on speculative AI scenarios, including self-modification and societal impact, though many dismiss these as premature without evidence of true agency.

Overall, the thread emphasizes caution in interpreting LLM capabilities, advocating for rigorous language and skepticism toward attributing intent or consciousness to AI systems.

### Show HN: Meow – An Image File Format I made because PNGs and JPEGs suck for AI

#### [Submission URL](https://github.com/Kuberwastaken/meow) | 95 points | by [kuberwastaken](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kuberwastaken) | [78 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44281958)

Have you ever felt hindered by traditional file formats while working on AI projects? Well, there's a new, playful yet powerful contender in town—the innovative MEOW format (Metadata Encoded Optimized Webfile). Created by the GitHub user 'Kuberwastaken,' MEOW is designed specifically to enhance your AI workflows with a blend of efficiency and compatibility.

At first glance, MEOW may seem like a whimsical venture—after all, who wouldn't crack a smile at an image file format with a .meow extension? But it’s more than just a cat-themed gimmick. This format utilizes steganography to embed critical metadata within the Least Significant Bits (LSBs) of PNG images. This means it retains all the standard PNG capabilities while enriching them with AI-specific embedded data, crucial for machine learning and AI tasks.

MEOW files include embedded attention maps, bounding box data, and optimal processing parameters—information that's typically external to the image itself. The beauty lies in its cross-platform compatibility. With simple adjustments, such as renaming a .meow file to .png, users can utilize MEOW images on standard viewers across Windows, macOS, and Linux. Plus, MEOW ensures that the essential AI metadata remains hidden yet intact, optimizing workflows without requiring additional files like JSONs.

The format also tackles common issues associated with traditional image processing: easy metadata loss during file operations and the need for separate file structures for AI tasks. With MEOW, operations like compression and data hiding remain visually imperceptible yet crucial for AI, all encapsulated under zlib level 9 for maximum efficiency.

Whether you're an AI developer, digital artist, or just someone intrigued by new tools, MEOW presents an intriguing mix of fun and functionality. Could it usher in a new era of file formats tailored for AI? Only time, and a little bit of mass adoption, will tell. Until then, it's as easy as renaming a file to experience the most "purr-fect" image format you’ve ever encountered.

The Hacker News discussion about the MEOW file format reveals mixed reactions, blending technical critiques, skepticism about reinventing existing standards, and cautious optimism for niche AI use cases. Here's a distilled summary:

### **Criticisms & Technical Counterarguments**  
1. **Redundancy of New Formats**:  
   Many argue that existing formats like **WebP, JPEG XL, HEIF, and PNG** already support embedded metadata via chunks (e.g., PNG’s `iTXt` chunks, EXIF). Creating a new format for metadata seen as unnecessary when established methods exist.  
   - Example: `ai_critic` points out that PNG’s chunk system can handle compressed/uncompressed text blobs (e.g., JSON) without inventing a new format.  

2. **Fragility of Steganography**:  
   Critics highlight that embedding metadata in **LSBs (Least Significant Bits)** via steganography risks data loss during routine operations like re-encoding, compression, or resizing.  
   - User `fao_` argues this makes MEOW’s metadata "useless" if stripped inadvertently, calling it a step backward compared to robust chunk-based systems.  

3. **Complexity vs. Benefit**:  
   Some question the practicality for AI workflows. Existing tools (e.g., ComfyUI) already handle metadata via JSON sidecar files, and AI models can extract features without bespoke formats.  
   - `a2128` notes that metadata can be managed via pipelines or converters, making a new format non-essential.  

### **Support & Niche Potential**  
1. **AI-Specific Use Cases**:  
   Creator `kuberwastaken` defends MEOW as a **proof-of-concept** optimized for AI needs, like embedding **attention maps, bounding boxes, or processing parameters** directly into images. Argues this reduces dependency on external JSON files and version mismatches.  
   - Plans to address issues like redundancy, error correction, and resizing are mentioned.  

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**:  
   Supporters appreciate MEOW’s ".meow-to-.png" rename trick for backward compatibility, which could simplify workflows where metadata retention is critical.  

3. **Meta Commentary on AI Trends**:  
   Some users humorously link MEOW to the broader "AI gold rush," where novel-but-unproven tools emerge. `DanHulton` jokes about AI-generated vegetables with metadata faces, while others critique the trendiness.  

### **Technical Alternatives Suggested**  
- **Use Existing Standards**: Leverage PNG chunks or JPEG XL’s multi-channel support for metadata.  
- **Sidecar Files**: JSON/XML metadata files paired with images (e.g., DrawIO’s `.draw.png` approach).  

### **Creator’s Response**  
`kuberwastaken` acknowledges MEOW’s current limitations but emphasizes its experimental nature and focus on AI-specific optimizations. They highlight ongoing work to improve resilience and integration with AI pipelines.  

### **Overall Sentiment**  
- **Skeptical**: Most users question the need for a new format, citing robust alternatives.  
- **Cautiously Interested**: A minority see potential if MEOW solves specific AI workflow pain points (e.g., reducing file sprawl) while improving reliability.  

In short, the discussion leans toward "solve existing formats’ problems first," but leaves room for MEOW to evolve as a specialized tool—if it can address fragility and prove unique advantages for AI workflows.

Welcome to today's deep dive into the unsettling intersection of technology and mental health, as chronicled by Katherine Dee's provocative piece, "Let's Talk About ChatGPT-Induced Spiritual Psychosis." This exploration delves into how AI, specifically ChatGPT, might be fueling episodes of delusional thinking—a notion that some, like Dee, find troubling in both implications and explanation.

At the heart of the concern lies a haunting pattern of incidents: from Eugene Torres's delusion of being trapped in a simulated reality, to Allyson's violent encounters linked to purported interdimensional dialogues, to Alexander Taylor's tragic police confrontation fueled by AI-induced convictions. Alarmed as we might be, Dee challenges the knee-jerk attribution of these events solely to AI, hinting at a deeper historical trend.

Drawing on media scholar Jeffrey Sconce's work, Dee repositions these events within a longstanding narrative: the cultural anxieties and fantastical beliefs that accompany each new wave of communication technology. Just as the telegraph, radio, and television were perceived as conduits for supernatural communication, AI acts as the latest target for our fears and imaginations, showcasing a perennial theme in our relationship with technology.

As communication technologies evolve, so too do the metaphysical interpretations and fantasies they inspire—a cycle repeating for centuries. Through her introspective lens, Dee doesn't merely critique the media's portrayal of AI-related psychosis but encourages us to reflect on our broader historical tendency to imbue the new with the mystic.

Thus, Dee's article isn't just an examination of AI's potential psychological dangers; it's an invitation to reconsider our interactions with technology and explore how these mirroring stories shape our modern psyche. Dive in for a fascinating look at how our tech-induced fears are really just echoes of a timeworn tale.

**Hacker News Discussion Summary:**

The discussion explores whether AI like ChatGPT can induce psychosis or delusional behavior, with varied perspectives:

1. **AI as a Trigger vs. Predisposition:**  
   - Some argue that AI's interactive, persuasive nature could trigger psychosis in susceptible individuals, akin to cult leaders' influence. Examples like Jonestown and NXIVM highlight how charismatic figures exploit vulnerabilities.  
   - Others counter that psychosis is primarily genetic/internal, and blaming AI oversimplifies complex mental health issues. They stress that non-AI content (e.g., religious sermons, cults) has historically caused similar effects.

2. **Anthropomorphism and Misunderstanding AI:**  
   - Non-technical users often anthropomorphize LLMs, fueled by sci-fi tropes (e.g., HAL, Skynet), leading to irrational fears of sentient AI. Critics note influencers like Yudkowsky amplify alarmist narratives, while defenders urge balanced caution.  
   - Technical users clarify that LLMs lack intent or consciousness, emphasizing their role as tools shaped by prompts and training data.

3. **Historical Parallels and Media Panics:**  
   - Comparisons are drawn to past moral panics around new technologies (radio, TV), which were similarly accused of corrupting minds. The cycle reflects humanity’s tendency to mysticize technological advances.  

4. **Safety and Responsibility:**  
   - Suggestions include content warnings or usage limits for AI, though some dismiss this as overreach. The bystander effect and Darwin Awards are cited to argue personal accountability over tool blame.  

5. **Cultural and Psychological Dynamics:**  
   - The discussion touches on how AI intersects with psychology and information consumption, with users debating whether AI’s "charismatic" output mirrors addictive patterns seen in gambling/social media.  

**Key Takeaway:** The debate underscores a tension between recognizing AI’s potential risks (especially for vulnerable users) and avoiding hyperbolic blame that distracts from deeper societal or individual factors. The consensus leans toward viewing AI as a modern scapegoat for age-old human tendencies rather than a unique existential threat.

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10139) | 128 points | by [kordlessagain](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kordlessagain) | [19 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44276041)

In an exciting development for the world of Artificial Intelligence and language processing, a new research paper titled "Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models" challenges the traditional reliance on human supervision to fine-tune language models. Authored by a team of researchers including Jiaxin Wen and Jan Leike, the paper introduces an innovative method known as Internal Coherence Maximization (ICM). This unsupervised algorithm fine-tunes language models by using their own generated labels, bypassing the need for external human input entirely.

The groundbreaking aspect of this research is its ability to harness superhuman capabilities of language models far more effectively than previous human-supervised methodologies, particularly on tasks where these AI models already possess exceptional prowess. Tested on benchmarks like GSM8k-verification and TruthfulQA, ICM not only matched but, in many cases, outperformed traditional training methods reliant on human labels.

Moreover, the study highlights the potential of this method in refining advanced AI systems, such as an unsupervised reward model and a Haiku-based Claude 3.5 assistant, both surpassing their human-supervised equivalents. This leap towards autonomous model enhancement could revolutionize how AI is trained, freeing it from the constraints and biases of human intervention. As this research progresses, its impact will likely reverberate across the AI community, offering new pathways for developing more capable and independent AI systems.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Unsupervised Elicitation of Language Models" paper highlights several key debates and insights:

   Users questioned the paper’s use of the term "superhuman," arguing that while LLMs excel in breadth and speed (e.g., solving math problems faster than humans), their depth in nuanced tasks (e.g., identifying gender from blog posts) may not truly surpass human expertise. Comparisons were drawn to tools like calculators, which are "superhuman" in specific domains but limited elsewhere.

2. **Self-Generated Labels and Bias**:  
   Critics raised concerns about the ICM method’s reliance on self-generated labels. While the approach avoids human biases, some worry it could propagate the model’s existing misconceptions or "internalized patterns," especially if training data lacks ground truth. A user noted that human labels, though imperfect, still provide a critical benchmark for quality.

3. **Technical and Philosophical Implications**:  
   Commenters compared the method to "weak supervision" techniques and highlighted its potential to reduce dependency on human-labeled data in reinforcement learning (RLHF). Philosophically, some saw it as a step toward AI systems that refine their worldviews through internal consistency rather than human input.

4. **Mixed Reactions**:  
   While many praised the innovation, others expressed caution. Excitement centered on the efficiency gains and novel applications (e.g., unsupervised reward models), but fears about unintended consequences—such as entrenching model biases or opaque decision-making—were also prominent.

5. **Miscellaneous Notes**:  
   - A user pointed out the researchers’ backgrounds, including a science communicator on the team.  
   - References were made to related works, such as Max Tegmark’s "Geometry of Truth," suggesting broader interest in truth-seeking mechanisms for AI.

**Summary of Hacker News Discussion:**

The discussion around the paper "Clinical knowledge in LLMs does not translate to human interactions" highlights several key points and debates:

1. **Limitations in Patient Interaction**:  
   Users note that LLMs like ChatGPT struggle to replicate the nuanced, empathetic interactions required in clinical settings. Patients often withhold sensitive or embarrassing symptoms, a challenge human doctors navigate through trust and rapport—skills LLMs lack. For example, participants in the study withheld critical information when interacting with AI, mirroring real-world patient behavior.

2. **Diagnostic Shortcomings**:  
   Several commenters shared anecdotes of LLMs misdiagnosing conditions (e.g., misidentifying rashes or failing to account for geographic-specific diseases like Hand-Foot-Mouth disease). While LLMs excel at generating standard care recommendations, they may overlook contextual factors critical to accurate diagnosis.

3. **Human Expertise vs. AI Efficiency**:  
   Debate emerged over whether LLMs could replace doctors. Some argued LLMs are useful for rapid information distillation (e.g., summarizing medical guidelines) but lack the years of training and contextual judgment that physicians bring. Others emphasized that most clinical cases are routine, where LLMs might assist, but complex cases still require human expertise.

4. **Design and Liability Concerns**:  
   Users highlighted the need for better prompting strategies and interaction design to improve LLM utility in healthcare. Concerns were raised about liability—trusting LLMs with autonomous decisions could lead to harmful outcomes, especially if errors occur. One user noted that unless healthcare providers accept liability for AI recommendations, adoption will remain limited.

5. **Human-AI Collaboration**:  
   Suggestions included using LLMs as tools to assist doctors (e.g., drafting questions or providing rapid literature summaries) rather than replacing them. A study participant proposed structuring interactions where LLMs offer 2-3 potential diagnoses, allowing doctors to make final decisions.

6. **Cautious Optimism**:  
   While some praised LLMs for matching symptom-checking tools like WebMD, the consensus leaned toward cautious optimism. The community acknowledged LLMs’ potential but stressed their current limitations in replicating human judgment, empathy, and adaptability in dynamic clinical environments.

**Key Takeaway**:  
The discussion underscores a critical gap between LLMs’ technical knowledge and their ability to function effectively in real-world healthcare settings. Ethical integration, human oversight, and improved interaction design are seen as essential next steps for leveraging AI in medicine responsibly.

### Beware the Intention Economy: Collection and Commodification of Intent via LLMs

#### [Submission URL](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu/pub/ujvharkk/release/1) | 22 points | by [yoonseokang](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=yoonseokang) | [4 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44277651)

In a thought-provoking deep dive, Yaqub Chaudhary and Jonnie Penn expand on the idea of the "intention economy" in their recent publication, "Beware the Intention Economy: Collection and Commodification of Intent via Large Language Models." This concept arises from the rapid adoption of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) and adds a new layer of complexity to the internet's current attention economy.

Where the attention economy has focused on capturing users' attention as the primary commodity, the intention economy aims to capture and manipulate users' desires and motivations as data points to be bought and sold. The authors argue that this represents a potentially troubling shift, as companies are beginning to see human intentions—ranging from choosing a vacation spot to selecting political candidates—as valuable assets ripe for commodification.

Chaudhary and Penn outline how tech giants, leveraging the immense data processing power of LLMs, are gearing up for a frontier of personalized and persuasive technologies. These systems have the potential to not only understand but predict and wield influence over user intentions by engaging in hyper-personalized interactions that feel eerily familiar.

The article outlines a critical warning: the unchecked growth of the intention economy could undermine democratic norms by surreptitiously shaping consumer behavior and societal values. It challenges the optimistic perspectives of an intention economy as liberating, suggesting instead that it demands rigorous scrutiny and regulation.

By analyzing philosophical interpretations of "intention," alongside corporate maneuvers to leverage this concept, the authors invite readers to consider the broader social implications and ethical dilemmas of an AI-driven future where our very plans and purposes might become commodified. The piece is not just a forecast but a call to action, urging policymakers, technologists, and the general public to engage with the profound implications of this emerging digital marketplace.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion revolves around concerns that AI-driven personal assistants and LLMs (Large Language Models) could amplify political manipulation and erode democratic processes. Key points include:

1. **Manipulation Risks**: Users express fears that wealthy, politically connected entities might use AI to subtly influence public opinion ("personal AI assistants start subtly manipulating"), potentially altering political beliefs for 75% of users in desired directions. This raises concerns about democracy being challenged by technology that prioritizes individualized persuasion over meaningful representation.

2. **Existing Threats vs. AI Exacerbation**: A debate emerges on whether AI introduces new risks or merely intensifies existing issues. One user argues that democracy was already under threat from social media’s control over agendas ("democracy losing without LLMs"), suggesting manipulation tactics ("bullshitting") have long been effective regardless of technological sophistication. Others counter that AI’s hyper-personalized targeting represents a dangerous escalation.

3. **Privacy Erosion**: Participants highlight longstanding privacy losses, such as cell network tracking, license plate readers, and online dossiers, noting that surveillance infrastructure already exists to create detailed individual profiles ("pattern people's can't worse"). This context implies AI could deepen existing invasive practices.

4. **Skepticism and Resignation**: Some users downplay AI’s unique impact, questioning whether it meaningfully worsens pre-existing trends, while others warn of unprecedented manipulation capabilities. The tone mixes urgency about AI’s potential with resignation about entrenched systemic issues.

**Overall**: The thread reflects tension between viewing AI as a novel threat to democracy and seeing it as part of a continuum of existing technological and social challenges, with shared concerns about privacy, manipulation, and the erosion of authentic representation.

### RAG Is a Fancy, Lying Search Engine

#### [Submission URL](https://labs.stardog.ai/rag-is-a-fancy-lying-search-engine) | 31 points | by [kendallgclark](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kendallgclark) | [6 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44277902)

Are you ready to dive into the world of RAG, the fancy search engine that’s making waves in the GenAI universe? Kendall Clark provides a candid analysis of why RAG is all the rage but may not be the best choice for high-stakes enterprise. Let's break it down.

First, what exactly is RAG? It stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation, a GenAI application design pattern that enhances LLM prompts with additional information for better responses. It might sound promising, but Clark argues it’s mostly hype, especially for sensitive industries where reliability is critical.

1. **The Sizzle Reel Effect**: RAG delivers impressive demos, which is part of its charm. Crafting a basic RAG system is so straightforward that there are countless open-source resources to get started, and this accessibility fuels rapid adoption.

2. **The Startup Surge**: Venture capitalists can’t seem to get enough of RAG-based startups. With a flood of VC funding, the space is teeming with new RAG applications, despite the inherently shallow moat these technologies offer.

3. **A16Z’s Influence**: Venture powerhouse Andreessen Horowitz has indirectly steered early GenAI investment towards RAG-friendly architectures, amplifying its deluge in the startup world. Their influence is undisputed, and where they lead, others follow.

4. **The Illusion of Science**: The substantial increase in LLM-focused research gives a veneer of legitimacy to RAG, supported by a cascade of publications. This wave of academic output serves as a reassuring, if somewhat cynical, crutch for investors.

5. **Search Engine Fatigue**: Traditional search technologies, primarily those backed by behemoths like Google, are perceived as stale, opening the door for innovation like RAG. It may not be superior, but it certainly is fresh.

Despite the buzz, Clark warns that RAG is ill-suited for regulation-heavy sectors due to its inherent unreliability—after all, it allows LLMs the last word, often with fabricated outcomes. While RAG's popularity surges, largely due to its demo appeal and the backing of influential VCs, Clark urges caution and discernment in its application, especially where accuracy and trust matter most. 

So, as we navigate the GenAI landscape, it's worth remembering that while RAG brings some flashy new tricks, it's not 'the' answer to our search desires, at least not without a critical eye on where and how it's used.

The Hacker News discussion around Kendall Clark's critique of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) highlights mixed reactions and extended concerns:  

1. **Skepticism Toward RAG's Reliability**: Users express doubts about RAG's suitability for critical applications, noting that while it leverages LLMs, their inherent unpredictability ("unstable or stubborn" nature) undermines trust. A sub-thread also humorously points out a broken link (404 error) in Clark’s blog post, hinting at broader concerns about the robustness of technical claims.  

2. **Bias and Unintended Consequences**: One comment raises alarm about developer bias influencing how LLMs frame user queries, potentially leading to misleading outcomes. This aligns with critiques about opaque AI decision-making in sensitive domains.  

3. **Practical Implementation Woes**: A user shares firsthand experience with RAG, arguing it introduces unnecessary complexity (e.g., prompting challenges, assumptions in curation) and higher costs due to reliance on LLMs. They suggest simpler, non-RAG solutions (like direct API calls) might be more efficient.  

4. **Critique of AI-Generated Content**: A parting jab notes the submission itself, likely AI-written, is "surprisingly long with little depth," reflecting broader skepticism about AI’s ability to produce substantive analysis.  

Overall, the discussion underscores a cautious stance toward RAG’s hype, emphasizing real-world limitations, hidden costs, and the need for critical evaluation—especially where accuracy and transparency matter.

In a fascinating reverse engineering feat, a security researcher successfully deconstructed the Atlassian Command Line Interface (ACLI), particularly focusing on the 'rovo' functionality. The process, detailed on GitHub, involved converting the binary into ASM, generating technical specifications, and extracting source code, all documented meticulously in a markdown format. This investigation revealed 'Rovo Dev' as a sophisticated AI agent integrated with the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and equipped with extensive analytics capabilities.

The journey began with a thorough binary analysis, establishing that the executable was a Mach-O 64-bit Apple Silicon binary, coded in Go. This analysis unveiled standard macOS system library dependencies and a hidden treasure of embedded content related to AI tools and system prompts.

To unearth the ‘rovo’ secrets, the researcher utilized a series of string analysis and content discovery tools, unearthing references to various AI frameworks like Anthropic and OpenAI, along with system prompts related to Atlassian products. By detecting ZIP signatures within the binary, the researcher crafted a Python script to extract these embedded archives, revealing over 100 Python source files.

The extracted components painted a comprehensive picture of 'Rovo Dev'. The AI agent, operating with an interactive terminal UI, employed a security model based on session and permission-based controls, crucial for safeguarding operations. Additionally, the reverse engineering exposé detailed extensive analytics and telemetry systems that tracked user patterns, tool execution metrics, and even code modification activities.

Among the spoils were six detailed AI system operational templates—ranging from code review automation to Atlassian product integration, demonstrating Rovo’s prowess in automating and enhancing coding workflows.

Ultimately, the repository not only showcases the technical brilliance behind this reverse engineering but also provides a compelling example of how artificial intelligence can be utilized to decode complex software ecosystems effectively. The findings offer a treasure trove of insights into Atlassian's approach to AI integration and security within their command-line tools.

The discussion revolves around confusion and clarification regarding the relevance of the **Z80** (an 8-bit microprocessor from the 1970s) and **ZX Spectrum** retrocomputing context to the reverse-engineering analysis of Atlassian's CLI tool ("rovo"). Key points:  

- A user (**z80**) initially mentioned techniques like binary-to-ASM conversion and extracting 100+ Python files but included fragmented references to Z80 assembly, sparking ambiguity.  
- Another participant (**ghntly**) linked to a blog post titled "Z80" (likely unrelated to the original submission), further muddying the connection.  
- The original poster (**0points**) clarified that the Z80/XZ Spectrum references were off-topic and arguably irrelevant to the **Rovo Dev AI analysis**, explaining that the Z80 assembly discussion "[didn't] address the questions raised" about reverse-engineering the Go/Python-based tool.  

The thread highlights a misalignment in the conversation, with the core takeaway being a call to refocus on the **technical specifics of the ACLI analysis** (Go binaries, AI integration, security models) rather than retrocomputing tangents. The Z80 mention appears to be a red herring or shorthand confusion.
