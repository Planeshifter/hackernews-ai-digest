#### [Submission URL](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2023/10/how-to-think-computationally-about-ai-the-universe-and-everything/) | 109 points | by [jam](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jam) | [71 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38049774)

In a recent talk at TED AI, Stephen Wolfram discussed the concept of computation and its implications for understanding the universe. Wolfram argued that computation is not just a possible formalization of the world, but the ultimate formalization for our universe. He explained that space and matter are made up of discrete elements, and the structure of the universe is defined by the network of relations between these elements. Using computational rules, the entire universe can be built from these discrete elements. Wolfram also discussed the emergence of gravity and quantum mechanics from these computational rules, and how different observers perceive the branching paths of the universe. He introduced the concept of the "ruliad," which is the unique object that encompasses all possible computational processes. Wolfram explained that observers, like us, can only sample specific slices of the ruliad, and that our perceived laws of physics are a result of our computational limitations and our belief in persistence in time. Overall, Wolfram presented a new paradigm for understanding the universe through computation, with implications for various fields including physics, mathematics, biology, and economics.

The discussion around Stephen Wolfram's talk at TED AI seems to be divided. Some people, like "nologic01," argue that Wolfram's computational theory fails to explain the complexities of the universe and that his models do not align with modern physics. They believe that his approach lacks evidence and does not stand up to experiments. Others, like "vnb," find Wolfram's ideas intriguing and see potential connections between computation and understanding the universe, though they are unsure about the validity of his claims. There is also discussion about the limitations of computational models and the need for empirical testing. Additionally, there are comments expressing skepticism about the usefulness of Wolfram's theories in practical applications, such as addressing climate change or building a stable society. Overall, the discussion explores the extent to which computation can explain the mysteries of the universe and the challenges of modeling complex systems.

Introducing MetaCLIP: A Tool for Curating and Training CLIP Models

Facebook Research has released MetaCLIP, a repository that contains everything you need to know about curating and training the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining) models. The repository includes curation/training code, metadata, distribution, and pre-trained models.

The main goal of MetaCLIP is to simplify the curation process of CLIP data. Unlike existing efforts that use the original CLIP model as a teacher for filtering student data, MetaCLIP allows users to curate data from scratch without relying on prior models. This approach makes the training data more transparent.

One of the key features of MetaCLIP is its scalability. The algorithm in MetaCLIP can be used to curate data from the entire CommonCrawl dataset, which contains over 300 billion image-text pairs. The researchers behind MetaCLIP emphasize that data quality is more important than quantity, and their algorithm focuses on preserving signal and mitigating noise rather than simply removing noise with blackbox filters.

The release of MetaCLIP not only includes the code but also provides the pre-training data distribution. This enables researchers to perform controlled experiments and fair comparisons using the same training and model configuration.

The research paper describing MetaCLIP, titled "Demystifying CLIP Data," provides further details on the methodology and findings. The researchers conclude that effective pretraining data should prioritize preserving signal and mitigating noise, and their algorithm offers a simpler and scalable approach to curating data from the internet.

For those interested in getting started with MetaCLIP, the repository provides a guide on how to install the required dependencies and offers pre-trained models for experimentation.

Overall, MetaCLIP is a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners working with CLIP models, as it offers a straightforward and scalable approach to curating and training data.

The discussion on Hacker News surrounding the announcement of MetaCLIP is quite active. Here are some key points from the comments:

- Some users express their interest in MetaCLIP and its potential applications, such as semantic image search, private collections, and trading card recognition.

- There is a discussion about CLIP and its capabilities, with some users highlighting its usefulness in various computer vision tasks, including image classification, automated labeling, image clustering, and content moderation. Others note the limitations of CLIP, such as the occasional duplication of words in generated captions.

- Users suggest trying out alternatives to CLIP, such as BLIP and LLaVA, for different use cases. There is also mention of other projects like StyleGAN, StyleCLIP, DALL-E, and NumPyCLIP that are related to CLIP.

- Some commenters mention the importance of larger context size in text inputs for improved CLIP performance. The limitations of the 77-character input length are acknowledged, and users express hope that future improvements will address this issue.

- The commercial licenses for CLIP and MetaCLIP are discussed, with some users asking about the availability of open-source versions. It is clarified that while CLIP is now commercially licensed, MetaCLIP is open-source.
