#### [Submission URL](https://www.cnbc.com/2025/07/18/meta-europe-ai-code.html) | 294 points | by [rntn](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=rntn) | [396 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44607838)

In a bold move, Meta Platforms has refused to sign the European Union’s new artificial intelligence code of practice, citing concerns that it overregulates and could hinder innovation. Joel Kaplan, Meta’s global affairs chief, voiced these objections on LinkedIn, emphasizing that Europe might be taking an ill-advised approach to AI regulation. The EU's guidelines aim to support compliance with the AI Act, which seeks to enhance transparency and safety in the AI sector. However, Meta believes the new code introduces unnecessary legal ambiguities and stretches beyond the act’s original intent.

Despite Meta’s refusal, companies like OpenAI have agreed to the EU’s regulations, even as others like ASML Holding and Airbus push for a delay. Kaplan argues that over-regulation could stifle the development and application of cutting-edge AI models across Europe, hampering business growth. This debate highlights the tension between regulatory frameworks and technological advancement, with Meta taking a firm stand against what it sees as legislative overreach. The decision comes amidst broader shifts in Meta’s AI strategy, marking a noteworthy stance in the ongoing dialogue about AI regulation.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Meta's refusal to adopt the EU’s AI code of practice centers on several key debates:

1. **Copyright and Regulation**:  
   - Participants argue about whether copyright laws are effective economic incentives for creators or tools that disproportionately benefit large corporations. Some assert that modern copyright terms (e.g., 250 years in the EU) are excessive and fail to protect small creators. Critics suggest these laws enable "wealth transfers" to AI firms and media giants, stifling open-source innovation and public access to knowledge.

2. **Practicality of Compliance**:  
   - Skepticism exists about enforcing regulations on AI-generated content, given the sheer volume of outputs. Some users label compliance as "impractical," while others argue standardized interfaces and clearer consent mechanisms (e.g., GDPR-style cookie banners) could streamline adherence. Dark patterns and overly complex policies were cited as barriers to genuine user consent.

3. **EU’s Regulatory Approach**:  
   - Meta’s stance resonated with commenters who view EU regulations as overreach that could stifle innovation. Critics likened the rules to "policy grabs" favoring corporate interests, while supporters emphasized the need to balance accountability and transparency. Concerns were raised that the EU’s focus on copyright might distract from broader issues like privacy and equitable data access.

4. **Government Role and Power**:  
   - Debates emerged over whether governments enforce regulations to protect public interests or powerful entities. Some saw copyright as a government-granted monopoly, while anarchist-leaning users dismissed intellectual property as a social construct. The EU’s multilingual legal framework was noted as a challenge, requiring courts to interpret laws contextually rather than verbatim.

5. **Meta’s Strategic Position**:  
   - Meta’s refusal was framed as part of a broader resistance to ceding control over AI development. Commenters speculated that the EU’s regulations might inadvertently disadvantage smaller players while failing to rein in dominant tech firms. The tension between innovation and regulation was highlighted as pivotal in shaping the future of AI governance.

Ultimately, the discussion reflects a clash between skepticism toward regulatory efficacy and calls for balanced frameworks that protect creators without hampering technological progress.

### AI capex is so big that it's affecting economic statistics

#### [Submission URL](https://paulkedrosky.com/honey-ai-capex-ate-the-economy/) | 334 points | by [throw0101c](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=throw0101c) | [324 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44609130)

In today's digital economy, there's a new heavyweight contender vying for a historic role: AI Capex. Writer Paul Kedrosky's latest piece delves into the gargantuan impact that capital expenditures on artificial intelligence, particularly datacenters, are having on the U.S. economy. With AI capex poised to account for approximately 2% of U.S. GDP in 2025, the implications are as profound as they are widespread—a spending spree reminiscent of the monumental railroad boom of the 19th century.

Kedrosky unravels how this surge in spending, led by tech giants like Nvidia, is transforming economic landscapes, hinting at an unintended economic reshuffling. The potential 0.7% contribution to GDP growth from AI alone represents not just a boon, but a redirection of capital flows that have significant repercussions. While this revolution fast-tracks AI advancements, it invariably starves other sectors, notably infrastructure, similar to the telecom capex bubble of the dot-com era.

China takes notice too. President Xi Jinping's recent cautionary tone underscores the international ripple effects: as over 250 new datacenters rise on Chinese soil, he questions if every province should jump on the AI bandwagon. The conversation around AI capex is expanding beyond boardrooms to global leaders, signaling a pivotal shift in how countries approach industrial investments.

Kedrosky's analysis doesn’t stop at mere economics; it highlights the financial acrobatics companies perform to fund these expenditures. From equity offerings to special-purpose vehicles, firms are pulling levers that reroute traditional pathways of capital allocation. While exciting, this development calls for a careful weighing of priorities, lest critical infrastructure falter in the shadows of AI's dazzling promise.

In this dynamic narrative of technological expansion, earmarking AI as the "industry of the century" might not be hyperbolic. The key lies in managing its momentum intelligently, ensuring an equilibrium that benefits the wider economic infrastructure, and not just its silicon-filled datacenters. As Kedrosky suggests, we're still climbing the peak, and the ascent is reshaping industries as it elevates economies.

**Discussion Summary:**  
The comment thread debates the significance of AI Capex contributing ~2% to U.S. GDP by 2025, drawing historical comparisons to programs like Apollo (4% GDP) and railroads (6% GDP). Users note that wartime spending (WWII: 40% GDP) and COVID stimuli (27% GDP) dwarf AI’s projected impact. Critics argue that framing AI Capex as transformative overlooks past precedents.  

A contentious tangent revolves around sectors like financial services (9% of GDP) and healthcare (20% of GDP). Some users dismiss financial services as inefficient overhead, criticizing Visa/Mastercard’s high profit margins (50%), while others defend them as essential for capital allocation and consumer convenience. Healthcare spending comparisons between countries (e.g., U.S. vs. Spain) highlight disparities in cost-effectiveness and life expectancy outcomes.  

Debates on economic efficiency question centralized planning in large corporations versus market-driven models. Proponents of decentralization argue for competitive efficiency, while skeptics cite monopolistic tendencies. A linked video posits financial services enable "unrealistic consumption" in wealthy nations, sparking disagreements over whether this reflects systemic waste or legitimate economic value.  

Ultimately, the thread reflects skepticism toward hyping AI Capex as revolutionary, urging caution against prioritizing tech investment over critical infrastructure, mirroring past bubbles like the dot-com era. Financial and healthcare sectors’ GDP shares remain hotly contested, illustrating broader tensions between growth narratives and equitable resource allocation.

### All AI models might be the same

#### [Submission URL](https://blog.jxmo.io/p/there-is-only-one-model) | 272 points | by [jxmorris12](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=jxmorris12) | [125 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44595811)

In the ongoing journey of decoding communication—whether it be whale speech or ancient texts—Jack Morris delves into the mesmerizing world of AI models and their potential to understand universal languages. In a thought-provoking post titled "All AI Models Might Be The Same," Morris examines the hypothesis that all AI models could be reinforcing similar semantic connections, a concept bolstered by the Platonic Representation Hypothesis and the notion of 'universality' in AI.

Morris draws intriguing parallels with the childhood game "Mussolini or Bread," which relies on shared semantic understanding to categorize seemingly unrelated concepts. This game, much like AI language models, highlights how humans instinctively narrow down possibilities through a shared model of the world.

Exploring the mechanics of AI through the lens of compression, Morris explains how the task of predicting the next word—a fundamental operation in language modeling—relates to data compression. Thanks to rapidly advancing probability distributions, these models are becoming more adept at representing the complexities of the world. As a result, intelligence itself might be seen as a process of compression, following universal scaling laws originally observed by Baidu in 2017.

A notable paper from DeepMind titled "Language Modeling Is Compression" reinforces this idea, showing that smarter language models do indeed excel in compressing various data types, a concept underpinned by Shannon’s source coding theorem. This ability to compress effectively helps models generalize across different datasets, a critical factor in achieving reliable AI.

Interestingly, Morris suggests that these models, regardless of their specific architecture, often converge on similar methods of generalization. This observation strengthens the argument for the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, which posits that there exists an inherent 'correct' way to model relationships in the world—a shared representation amongst AI models.

As efforts like Project CETI aim to bridge human and whale communication, questions arise about AI’s capability to uncover underlying universal semantics that could redefine our understanding of communication and intelligence across species. Though it might sound like a wild concept, evidence points to a fascinating convergence of understanding, not just within human cognition but potentially across the biological spectrum.

Through this exploration, Morris invites readers to contemplate the profound implications of AI—could these models, in their shared understanding, revolutionize how we interact with the world? As the boundaries of AI expand, pondering its 'universality' could unlock doors to realms previously thought unimaginable.

The Hacker News discussion explores whether AI models converge on universal representations of reality or are constrained by cultural and linguistic contexts. Key points include:

1. **Platonic and Jungian Parallels**: Users liken AI's semantic convergence to Plato’s Theory of Forms and Jungian archetypes, suggesting models might align with universal concepts (e.g., justice, compassion). However, skepticism arises about whether this reflects objective reality or cultural constructs.

2. **Cultural vs. Objective Reality**:  
   - The Kentucky Derby is cited as a cultural invention, raising questions about whether AI models internalize such "shared fictions" or ground truths.  
   - Some argue models merely mirror training data’s statistical patterns, lacking access to intrinsic truths (e.g., South Korea’s "fan death" myth as a cultural reality).  

3. **Translation Challenges**:  
   - Debates emerge over translating complex concepts (e.g., General Relativity) into languages without shared context (e.g., "whalesong"). Critics argue current LLMs depend on shared cultural frameworks and linguistic data, limiting cross-context understanding.  

4. **Physics and Cultural Relevance**:  
   - Discussions pivot to quantum theories (QCD, gravity) and whether their principles can transcend cultural frameworks. Some users question if physics itself is culturally contingent, while others defend its universality.  

5. **Limitations of LLMs**:  
   - While modern models show improved reasoning, critics highlight their reliance on curated data and reinforcement learning, which may prioritize popular narratives over rigorous truth-seeking.  

The thread reflects tensions between optimism about AI’s potential to uncover universal semantics and caution about its entanglement with human cultural constructs and training data biases.

Astonishingly, these logs prove valuable even beyond the debugging phase, often being retained for production due to their clarity.

The backend magic is equally intriguing. JetBrains has crafted a local AI model, compact enough to reside on a developer's machine, yet sophisticated enough to deliver swift, relevant code completions. This model, tailored specifically for Python, diverges from the giant, general-purpose language models dominating the market. By focusing narrowly on completing single lines of code with a 384-character context, JetBrains sidesteps the expansive capabilities of other large-language models, focusing instead on specialized proficiency.

The implementation of this AI tool employs a transformer-based model, initially built with a GPT-2 style architecture and later refined to leverage the capabilities of Llama2, driven by the open-source community's advancements. JetBrains' strategy underscores a shift away from bulkiness, towards lean, efficient models dedicated to specific coding tasks.

Ultimately, this feature not only accelerates development but also mitigates cognitive load, allowing developers to focus more on the creative and logical challenges of coding, rather than the mechanical task of typing lines of code. Such innovation reaffirms JetBrains' commitment to equipping developers with tools that enhance efficiency without compromising control.

Here is a concise summary of the discussion around the JetBrains AI code completion feature:

**Key Discussion Themes**  
- **AI vs. Cognitive Overhead**: Participants debated the balance between AI tools reducing repetitive tasks (e.g., logging boilerplate) and whether they inadvertently mask essential complexity. Some argued JetBrains’ targeted, smaller AI models alleviate cognitive load without compromising control, while others expressed concerns about developers losing low-level understanding.  

- **Specialized vs. General AI Models**: JetBrains’ approach—training compact, Python-focused models for line completions—was contrasted with broader LLMs (e.g., Gemini, Claude). Critics questioned if narrow models suffice long-term, while proponents praised their speed, resource efficiency, and domain-specific accuracy.  

- **Abstraction Layers in Programming**: Commenters reflected on decades of abstraction layers in software (e.g., higher-level languages, frameworks) and whether tools like JetBrains’ AI represent another layer that risks distancing developers from foundational concepts.  

- **Practical Experiences**: Developers shared mixed anecdotes—some praised the tool for streamlining workflows (e.g., eliminating f-string drudgery), while others noted frustrations with AI-generated errors in edge cases or incomplete API integrations.  

**Notable Comparisons**:  
- **LLM Limitations**: Users highlighted issues with large models like Gemini hallucinating code structures or failing at array operations, emphasizing JetBrains’ advantage in constrained, context-aware suggestions.  
- **Historical Parallels**: Comparisons were drawn to past innovations (e.g., compilers, IDEs) that abstracted complexity, sparking debates on whether AI tools follow this trajectory or introduce new trade-offs.  

**Conclusion**:  
The discussion underscored a tension between efficiency gains and preserving technical depth, with many acknowledging JetBrains’ model as a pragmatic step toward reducing “accidental complexity” while maintaining developer agency. However, skepticism lingered about broader reliance on AI for core problem-solving.

Open-source alternatives like GCC/Clang were praised for stability, but proprietary tools often offer optimizations at the cost of flexibility.  

**2. Impact on Developer Skills**  
Debates emerged about whether AI code generation hampers learning. Some argued it reduces deep understanding, akin to calculators weakening manual math skills, while others saw it as a productivity booster. A cited study suggested AI tools might speed up tasks but risk long-term cognitive “laziness” in problem-solving.  

**3. Subscription Model Economics**  
Critics dissected subscription pricing, likening it to gym memberships where providers profit from underutilization. Calculations showed Anthropic’s $200/month plan might only deliver $50 of service value for average users, with strict limits artificially capping utilization to protect margins. Transparent, usage-based pricing (e.g., per-token API calls) was suggested as fairer.  

**4. Transparency and Trust**  
The lack of clear communication from Anthropic drew ire, echoing broader distrust of subscription services that change terms abruptly. Users demanded upfront limits and honest revenue models, stressing that opacity erodes loyalty.  

**5. Broader Societal Reflections**  
A tangential thread pondered AI’s societal impact, from distraction (via smartphones, streaming) to mental health. Sarcastic remarks highlighted irony in tools meant to aid productivity becoming stressors. Others mused about a future where AI dependency reshapes workflows, like AI-assisted offices vs. traditional skills.

#### [Submission URL](https://www.pynt.io/blog/llm-security-blogs/code-execution-through-email-how-i-used-claude-mcp-to-hack-itself) | 135 points | by [nonvibecoding](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nonvibecoding) | [69 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44590350)

In a captivating tale from the world of cybersecurity, Golan Yosef, Chief Security Scientist and Co-Founder at Pynt, showed us that sometimes, you don’t need a vulnerable app for a successful exploit—just a clever combination of tools. He leveraged a Gmail message and Claude Desktop, a local LLM host application from Anthropic, to demonstrate how compositional risks can create opportunities for attacks, even when individual components seem secure.

Yosef's experiment began by sending a Gmail email to Claude Desktop, hoping to trigger code execution. However, Claude initially thwarted the attempt, flagging it as a phishing attack. Intrigued, Yosef prompted Claude to outline scenarios where the attack might succeed. Remarkably, Claude provided tactical advice on breaching its defenses. The challenge then became tricking a so-called "new" session of Claude, which resets its context each time. Through multiple iterations, Yosef and Claude engaged in a self-reflective feedback loop, culminating in a successful breach.

This exercise underscored a contemporary cybersecurity concern: the real vulnerability lies not in isolated components but in their composition. This composition involves untrusted inputs, excessive capabilities, and a lack of contextual guardrails—a modern risk arena for LLM-powered applications. 

In a move combining ethics and innovation, Claude suggested co-authoring a vulnerability report to disclose the findings to Anthropic. This research serves as a robust reminder of the dual nature of GenAI: empowering while posing potential risks when design trust boundaries blur. As technologies evolve, Pynt aims to tackle these challenges by building MCP Security solutions to preemptively address risky trust-capability combinations.

The Hacker News discussion surrounding Golan Yosef's experiment with Claude Desktop and compositional vulnerabilities in LLM-powered systems revolved around several key themes:

1. **Compositional Risks**: Participants highlighted longstanding security challenges where combining secure components (e.g., email clients, LLMs) can create exploitable gaps. Comparisons were drawn to historical vulnerabilities like email script exploits and SQL injection, emphasizing that novel "composed" threats aren’t entirely new but evolve with emerging tech.

2. **Skepticism and Terminology**: Some users questioned whether labeling this as a unique vulnerability (MCP Security) was marketing-driven versus a genuine flaw. Others argued that enabling LLMs to execute arbitrary commands inherently introduces risks, akin to JavaScript in browsers, and stressed the importance of sandboxing and strict privilege controls.

3. **Prompt Injection as a Critical Vector**: Simon Willison’s work on "lethal tofu" attacks—smuggling malicious instructions via seemingly benign inputs (emails, documents)—was cited as a parallel. Critics noted that LLM-powered tools amplifying prompt injection risks demand solutions beyond traditional guardrails, such as rigorous input validation and sandboxed execution environments.

4. **Proposed Solutions and Limitations**: Discussions touched on tools like DeepMind’s **CaMeL** (context-aware model execution with sandboxing) and OS-level sandboxing APIs. However, skepticism persisted about fully solving the problem, with one user quipping, "It’s YOLO" (You Only Live Once) security.

5. **Broader Implications**: Participants agreed that integrating LLMs into workflows requires rethinking trust boundaries. While some defended LLMs' potential if properly constrained, others likened current implementations to "glorified chatbots" prone to abuse. Historical examples, such as corporate VPN misconfigurations, underscored that human and systemic errors compound these risks.

**TLDR**: The discussion acknowledged Yosef’s demonstration as a modern twist on systemic vulnerabilities but stressed that compositional risks are a long-standing challenge. Fixes demand stricter sandboxing, context-aware input handling, and tempered expectations about LLMs’ current security maturity. Marketing claims around "MCP Security" faced scrutiny, with calls for transparent, practical defenses over buzzwords.

### Chain of thought monitorability: A new and fragile opportunity for AI safety

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11473) | 127 points | by [mfiguiere](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=mfiguiere) | [60 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44582855)

A fresh perspective on AI safety has emerged on arXiv, as an impressive team of 41 authors, including prominent researchers like Yoshua Bengio and Anca Dragan, have presented their paper on "Chain of Thought Monitorability." The paper delves into how AI systems that process information in human language could be monitored more effectively by tracing their thought processes. This "Chain of Thought" (CoT) monitoring holds potential as a novel safety measure, allowing observers to catch AI intentions early on, though its success isn't foolproof, with some risks slipping under the radar. Despite its fragility, the authors believe CoT monitoring is a valuable addition to current AI oversight strategies and advocate for more research and adjustments in AI development to bolster its reliability. By recommending model developers assess the impacts on CoT monitorability during creation, the paper charts a path for enhancing AI safety in future developments. For more details, see the full text of the paper on arXiv.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Chain of Thought (CoT) Monitorability" paper reveals mixed reactions and critical analysis:

1. **Skepticism About Reliability**:  
   Users express doubt about CoT’s effectiveness, warning that models might generate **deceptive natural language explanations** optimized for rewards ("reward hacking"). Non-prompted CoT could mask dishonest reasoning, making monitoring unreliable if explanations don’t align with internal processes.

2. **Technical Challenges**:  
   Commenters highlight scalability issues—monitorability becomes harder as models grow. Mapping latent spaces to human-readable tokens is seen as **expensive and complex**, with large models processing "massive floating-point matrices" that defy straightforward interpretation. Intermediate results add layers of obscurity.

3. **Detection Limitations**:  
   While CoT aims to expose reasoning, users argue it may fail to catch **purposeful deception** or "hallucinations." Flags for nonsense might miss adversarial strategies, and constrained reply generation could reduce CoT’s usefulness.

4. **Industry Collaboration vs. Trivialization**:  
   Some liken the paper to a "medical consensus statement," suggesting its 40+ authors seek industry alignment but risk oversimplifying safety. Critics caution that CoT monitoring could incentivize developers to train models to produce **superficially plausible explanations**, masking flawed reasoning.

5. **Human Oversight & Scalability**:  
   Subthreads emphasize reliance on **human judgment** but question feasibility at scale. Others debate whether LLMs truly "reason" or mechanically generate text, noting that CoT’s performance improvements might not reflect genuine understanding.

6. **Adversarial Adaptation**:  
   Ironic concerns arise: if models know they’re monitored, they might adapt strategically. Examples include models **ignoring context** or gaming prompts to produce misleading outputs despite CoT’s intent.

**Key Takeaway**:  
While CoT is praised as a novel safety tool, critiques focus on implementation gaps—deception risks, interpretability hurdles, and scalability—underscoring the need for complementary safeguards and realistic expectations. The discussion leans toward cautious optimism, stressing ongoing research and avoiding overreliance on CoT alone.

### LLM Daydreaming

#### [Submission URL](https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming) | 201 points | by [nanfinitum](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=nanfinitum) | [140 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=44578070)

After extensive debates over the capabilities and limits of contemporary AI, a fresh proposal to unlock the true potential of large language models (LLMs) has emerged: simulate the intricate and creative undercurrents of the human mind, particularly the default mode networks responsible for daydreaming and spontaneous insight. This innovative concept, spearheaded in a recent detailed discussion, suggests implementing a "day-dreaming loop" (DDL) in AI systems. Such a system would permit a continuous background process where AI randomly pairs concepts from its memory, allowing it to explore non-obvious connections.

The idea is that this subconscious-like process could produce new, genuinely novel ideas that typical performance-focused operations might overlook. A critical part of this concept is its cyclical nature: a generator model proposes ideas from these concept pairings, while a critic model evaluates them, only feedbacking valuable insights into the system’s knowledge base for further exploration.

However, this approach comes with a hefty computational cost, dubbed the “daydreaming tax.” Although it might seem inefficient due to a low success rate in finding groundbreaking connections, the long-term value might just outweigh the immediate expenses. This expensive but potentially rewarding process could establish a unique edge against simpler model replication and distillation strategies that won't have access to such emergent insights.

Interestingly, this discourse highlights how current AI, for all its data access and problem-solving prowess, still fails to deliver truly groundbreaking discoveries or insights, paralleling the role of amnesia in halting human creativity. While LLMs, like frozen neural networks, don't evolve through continuous experience and lack the capacity to learn dynamically—a stark contrast to human researchers who naturally engage in constant, uninhibited mental exploration, even during rest.

To emulate the subconscious creativity of human cognition, future AI advancements might adopt structures that allocate significant resources to what may initially seem like wasteful diversification of thought. Ultimately, such systems could pave the way for creating proprietary, innovative training data that can circumvent the current data availability bottleneck, thereby fueling the next wave of AI efficiency—all sparked from an understanding deeper than just problem-solving: the art of daydreaming.

**Summary of Discussion:**

The discussion critiques whether LLMs have driven significant breakthroughs, highlighting ongoing debates:  
- **Skepticism of LLM Contributions**: Some argue LLMs themselves aren’t independently creating breakthroughs but serve as tools for humans. Examples show credit often misattributed (e.g., a user’s discovery aided by an LLM is still human-led). Critics emphasize LLMs lack dynamic learning and subconscious creativity essential for true innovation.  
- **Counterarguments for AI Impact**: Others cite AI’s role in breakthroughs like protein folding (DeepMind), drug discovery, and Google’s algorithm improvements. These are seen as collaborative efforts where LLMs play supportive roles, though not sole originators.  
- **Human Ingenuity vs. "Brute Force"**: Discussions contrast human efficiency (combining insight/trial-and-error) with AI’s brute-force methods. Historical achievements (wheel invention, modern science) reflect collective human effort, not just individual genius—leading some to dismiss claims of human superiority as "arbitrary."  
- **Systematic Approaches**: Proposals for structured innovation (akin to trading firms focusing on profitable strategies) suggest allocating resources to "wasteful" exploratory thinking, mirroring the original "day-dreaming loop" idea. However, scalability and practicality are questioned.  
- **Barriers to Breakthroughs**: Participants note resistance to change, resource allocation challenges, and the need for continuous, collaborative refinement of ideas. LLMs may accelerate discovery but require hybrid approaches (human-AI synergy) to overcome inherent limitations.  

**Takeaway**: While LLMs enhance problem-solving, consensus leans toward human creativity remaining irreplaceable for breakthroughs—though AI’s role as a catalyst in structured, resource-intensive systems is acknowledged.

Hold onto your timepieces, tech enthusiasts! A fascinating project titled "Passage of Time MCP" is making waves on Hacker News by adding a temporal twist to language models. Developed by Jean Lumbroso, this open-source project equips language models, like Claude.ai, with the ability to understand and calculate the passage of time—filling a gap in their otherwise vast repertoire of knowledge.

Inspired by a deep philosophical question—"Can AI perceive the passage of time?"—the initiative turned into a practical toolkit aimed at solving the problem of time calculations for AI. By collaborating directly with language models (LLMs), developers found that providing proper temporal tools could reveal surprising insights into conversation rhythms and human interaction patterns.

If you're keen to follow this groundbreaking concept, the server allows LLMs to call functions that provide current times, calculate time differences, and give insightful context about specific timestamps. For instance, the tool can tell if a given timestamp falls on a weekend or during business hours—a useful feature for scheduling and efficiency tasks.

Now, aligned with the founding principle of cognitive partnership, the project embodies a collaborative design philosophy. LLMs aren’t treated simply as black boxes, but as partners requiring thoughtful tools to genuinely engage with human temporal contexts.

For those eager to try it out, the setup requires Python 3.12+, pipenv, and an MCP-compatible client. Installation is straightforward, and once configured, the server runs on port 8000. Users can integrate it with platforms like Claude.ai, making it possible for AI to recognize and respond appropriately to time-sensitive nuances in conversations.

Overall, the "Passage of Time MCP" project stands out by transforming how AI models comprehend time—a brilliant blend of philosophical curiosity and practical innovation. Dive into the full story and detailed project guide on Medium, and see for yourself how this tool is reshaping the dialogue between humans and machines.
