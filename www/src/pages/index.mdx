### Detecting hallucinations in large language models using semantic entropy

#### [Submission URL](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07421-0) | 186 points | by [Tomte](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=Tomte) | [128 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=40769496)

The top story on Hacker News today discusses a method developed by researchers to detect hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and Gemini. These models, while impressive in reasoning and question-answering capabilities, often generate false outputs and unsubstantiated answers, which can lead to unreliable information being spread. 

The researchers focused on a subset of hallucinations called 'confabulations,' where the LLMs fluently provide wrong and arbitrary answers. By developing a quantitative measure to detect when an input is likely to cause an LLM to generate such confabulations, the method helps improve question-answering accuracy and raises awareness about the unreliability of answers. 

This work is crucial for the field of free-form generation, where traditional approaches fail, and provides a step towards addressing the issue of hallucinations in LLMs. By measuring the 'semantic entropy' of LLM outputs, the method can estimate semantic uncertainties and help identify instances where the model may provide incorrect or irrelevant answers.

The discussion around the top story on Hacker News today delves into technical details regarding the detection of hallucinations in large language models (LLMs). Users emphasize the importance of proper training data for models like Taylor Swift's comedy connections and the role of semantic similarity in identifying hallucinations. There is a debate on the effectiveness of methods like phrasal sampling and the significance of logical reasoning problems in artificial intelligence systems.

The top story on Hacker News today is about OpenAI and Anthropic allegedly disregarding the established web rule that prevents bots from scraping online content without permission. According to Business Insider, these AI companies are either ignoring or bypassing the robots.txt protocol, which restricts automated scraping of websites. The issue was raised by TollBit, a startup working to facilitate paid licensing agreements between publishers and AI firms. Despite public statements from OpenAI and Anthropic claiming to respect robots.txt, the investigation by TollBit revealed otherwise. This has sparked concerns about the use of unauthorized data for training AI models and the potential copyright implications. AI models like ChatGPT and Claude rely heavily on scraped content from the web, raising questions about data ownership and usage ethics in the AI industry.
