### Title of work deciphered in sealed Herculaneum scroll via digital unwrapping

#### [Submission URL](https://www.finebooksmagazine.com/fine-books-news/title-work-deciphered-sealed-herculaneum-scroll-digital-unwrapping) | 231 points | by [namanyayg](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=namanyayg) | [111 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43953883)

In an extraordinary revelation, researchers have harnessed the power of digital unwrapping to finally uncover the title and author of a scroll that had been sealed since the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The scroll, known as PHerc. 172 from Herculaneum, was identified using advanced imaging techniques as "On Vices" by the Greek philosopher Philodemus. This significant discovery, part of the ongoing Vesuvius Challenge, not only brings new insight into ancient philosophical teachings but also earned the researchers a much-coveted prize of $60,000.

The scroll was painstakingly scanned in July 2024 and the data subsequently released for public analysis, inviting global participation. The title was independently deciphered by Sean Johnson from the Vesuvius Challenge and a research duo from the University of Würzburg, marking a significant milestone in the study of ancient texts. Philodemus, an Epicurean philosopher known for advocating the pursuit of pleasure as a path to a virtuous life, has been a central figure in the vast collection of works found at the Villa of Papyri at Herculaneum.

While the revelation of the work's title is a triumph, questions remain about its exact placement within Philodemus’ larger "On Vices" series, speculated to be at least 10 books long. These achievements highlight the transformative potential of integrating artificial intelligence into humanities research, breathing new life into ancient artifacts and offering fresh perspectives on historical scholarship.

The Vesuvius Challenge, initiated in 2023, continues to push the boundaries of knowledge by encouraging researchers worldwide to delve into the secrets of these ancient scrolls without causing physical harm, embodying a remarkable confluence of technology and history.

The discussion revolves around the appropriateness of labeling the ancient Herculaneum library as "pagan," given its Greco-Roman philosophical texts. Key points of debate include:  

1. **Terminology Concerns**: Critics argue "pagan" is an anachronistic Christian-centric term that imposes later religious frameworks onto a pre-Christian context. Supporters counter that it’s a widely accepted descriptor for Rome’s polytheistic traditions, distinguishing it from Abrahamic faiths.  

2. **Historical Context**: Some emphasize that the library, containing Epicurean works like Philodemus’, reflects a pre-Christian Roman intellectual tradition. Opponents stress that "pagan" risks distorting the era’s worldview, as Christianity hadn’t yet dominated Roman society (in 79 AD).  

3. **Modern Bias**: Users debate whether labeling it "pagan" inadvertently centers a Christian perspective, akin to calling non-Jewish texts "Goy." Comparisons are drawn to modern terminology, like avoiding "pagan" for Indian or Greek studies, to prevent cultural misrepresentation.  

4. **Scholarly Nuance**: Participants note that while "pagan" simplifies categorization, it may strip historical specificity. Alternatives like "non-Christian" or referencing specific philosophies (e.g., Epicurean) are suggested for accuracy.  

The discussion concludes with no resolution but highlights tensions between linguistic convenience and historical fidelity, underscoring the challenge of describing ancient contexts through modern lenses.

### LSP client in Clojure in 200 lines of code

#### [Submission URL](https://vlaaad.github.io/lsp-client-in-200-lines-of-code) | 157 points | by [vlaaad](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=vlaaad) | [23 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43955397)

In a fascinating exploration of coding efficiency, a Clojure enthusiast has created a minimal Language Server Protocol (LSP) client in just 200 lines of code. While initially attempting to integrate Large Language Models (LLMs) with LSP for smarter code navigation and inquiries, the coder unexpectedly pivoted towards crafting this lean client. This project underscores the power of LSP, which simplifies the integration process between code editors and language-specific tools by leveraging a standardized communication protocol, much like HTTP but for programming languages.

The focus of the project is not broad appeal—indeed, it's humorously noted that the audience might just be the three Clojure developers who write code editors—but rather educational. The challenge taken up was to develop a command-line linter using an LSP server without getting bogged down by the complexity of a full-fledged text editor.

The prototype excludes components like a JSON parser and document syncing, keeping things streamlined. Instead, it establishes a foundational communication layer between client and server using Java 24 with virtual threads, optimizing performance. The setup employs JSON-RPC, a protocol for remote procedure calls, layered over the base communication, to handle requests and responses efficiently.

By translating the client and server communication from byte streams into manageable JSON blobs, the project illustrates a clever application of programming concepts—demonstrating not just technical prowess, but the joy of solving 'MxN problems' with an 'M+N' approach. This clever synthesis from the Clojure community offers both a learning opportunity for developers and a testament to the art of coding small yet effective solutions.

1. **Clojure’s Strengths and Criticisms**:  
   - Supporters praise Clojure’s conciseness, expressiveness, and Java interop, arguing that its syntax allows for elegant solutions (e.g., the 200-line LSP client). Critics counter that Clojure’s reliance on Java and perceived complexity (e.g., `core.async`) can deter newcomers.  
   - Some users note that Clojure’s functional style and immutable data structures make code readable and maintainable, while others find its abstraction level challenging.  

2. **Java Boilerplate and Dependencies**:  
   - Comparisons to Java emphasize Clojure’s brevity—200 lines in Clojure vs. verbose Java boilerplate. However, subthreads acknowledge hidden complexities, such as dependency management (e.g., JSON libraries) and startup times for LSP servers.  
   - Technical debates arise over Clojure’s use of JAR files, native executables, and trade-offs in performance vs. simplicity.

3. **Clojure’s Niche and Community**:  
   - The post humorously targets "three Clojure devs," sparking discussions about the language’s niche appeal. Some argue Clojure’s learning curve limits adoption, while others highlight its passionate community and use in production systems.  
   - Mentions of **Jank** (a Clojure dialect targeting C++) reflect interest in expanding Clojure’s reach beyond the JVM, though skepticism remains about its mainstream potential.

4. **Is Clojure "Dying"?**:  
   - Mixed opinions emerge: Some users joke about Clojure’s "dying" status, while others point to active podcasts, new projects (e.g., Jank), and steady corporate adoption. Concerns about job market viability are countered by anecdotes of long-term professional use.  

5. **Tooling and Language Design**:  
   - The LSP client project sparks praise for Clojure’s composability and REPL-driven development. Discussions also touch on broader language design philosophies, with comparisons to Python, Rust, and JavaScript.  
   - A recurring theme is the importance of tooling (e.g., LSP) in enhancing developer experience, regardless of language popularity.

**Key Takeaway**: The thread reflects a blend of admiration for Clojure’s elegance and pragmatism, tempered by debates over its ecosystem challenges and niche appeal. While enthusiasts champion its expressiveness, the broader programming community remains divided on its accessibility and future trajectory.

In a surprising shift, Klarna, the buy now, pay later giant, is reintroducing human elements into its customer service strategy, just a year after its bold assertion that AI could replace the roles of 700 human representatives. At the time, Klarna had leaned heavily into automation, cutting costs and boasting impressive AI stats, such as reducing average resolution times to under two minutes. However, growing customer frustrations and a desire for more empathetic interactions have now prompted a rethink.

Klarna's spokesperson, Clare Nordstrom, emphasizes how AI will continue to provide speed and efficiency but highlights the irreplaceable value of human empathy and expertise. "AI gives us speed. Talent gives us empathy," she states, underscoring a balanced approach to customer service that clearly integrates both human and machine efforts.

CEO Sebastian Siemiatkowski acknowledges past missteps, recognizing that prioritizing cost savings inadvertently compromised service quality. The new strategy will feature a flexible "Uber-type setup" for customer support, focusing on attracting talented professionals who can deliver exceptional service experiences.

This pivot comes amid industry-wide realizations that customer satisfaction is deeply rooted in human connection. Studies reinforce this, with a significant portion of customers expressing frustrations over impersonal chatbot interactions and a clear need for access to human support for more complex or sensitive issues. Klarna's revised approach suggests that a hybrid model, leveraging both human and AI strengths, could be the key to future-proofing customer service.

The Hacker News discussion on Klarna's reversal to incorporating human customer service, despite earlier AI-driven cuts, highlights several critical themes:

1. **Skepticism About Motives**: Users speculate that Klarna’s pivot is a strategic move to polish its image ahead of a potential IPO, framing itself as an “AI company” to attract higher valuations, rather than a genuine prioritization of customer experience.

2. **Critique of BNPL Model**: Commentators compare Klarna’s business to “loan sharking,” criticizing its high-interest rates and exploitative practices. Critics argue BNPL services target vulnerable demographics, enabling debt accumulation for non-essential purchases, despite Klarna’s claims of affordability.

3. **AI’s Role vs. Human Empathy**: While AI efficiently handles routine tasks (e.g., resolving missing food orders), users acknowledge its limitations in complex or sensitive scenarios. Many support a hybrid model but caution that human agents risk becoming a cost-cutting “Uber-style gig workforce” rather than a meaningful improvement.

4. **Regulatory and Ethical Concerns**: In markets like the Netherlands, regulators are scrutinizing BNPL providers for predatory practices. Critics highlight Klarna’s fees (e.g., 4% per transaction vs. traditional methods) and the social impact of normalizing debt, especially among younger users.

5. **Technical Execution Challenges**: Klarna’s AI tools are criticized for clunky workflows and poor integration, suggesting the hybrid shift stems from technical shortcomings, not just empathy-driven strategy.

6. **BNPL’s Impact on Consumer Behavior**: Proponents argue BNPL boosts sales by making purchases psychologically affordable (e.g., splitting payments), while detractors warn it reduces long-term customer spending and perpetuates debt cycles, akin to credit cards but with less transparency.

7. **Industry Comparisons**: Users contrast Klarna with platforms like Uber and DoorDash, noting differences in core models (consumer finance vs. service logistics) but parallels in gig-economy labor structures.

**Conclusion**: The discussion reflects broad skepticism about Klarna’s intentions and the BNPL sector’s ethics, with cautious optimism for hybrid customer service models. However, concerns persist about regulatory risks, debt exploitation, and whether human integration addresses systemic issues or merely serves as PR.

### Absolute Zero: Reinforced Self-Play Reasoning with Zero Data

#### [Submission URL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03335) | 82 points | by [leodriesch](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=leodriesch) | [18 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43951985)

In a fascinating leap forward for AI, researchers have introduced "Absolute Zero," a revolutionary approach that pushes the boundaries of machine learning by omitting external training data entirely. This innovative paradigm, proposed by Andrew Zhao and team, spotlights the Absolute Zero Reasoner (AZR), a system designed to independently generate and solve its own tasks to enhance reasoning—without relying on pre-existing datasets.

The novelty here is its reliance on reinforced self-play with verifiable rewards (RLVR), a mechanism that traditionally benefits from human-supplied question-and-answer sets to train models. Absolute Zero, however, sidesteps this requirement, creating a model that evolves by crafting challenges suited to its learning goals, embracing a future where AI may need to autonomously learn beyond human-provided data.

Notably, AZR not only stands out by thriving on zero external data but also delivers state-of-the-art results in complex coding and math tasks, surpassing those models trained on vast human-curated collections. This breakthrough showcases potential scalability and adaptability across different model scales and architectures, forging a path towards more independent and open-ended AI learning systems. This development invites speculation on the implications of autonomous AI learning as systems grow beyond human-level intelligence.

The Hacker News discussion on the "Absolute Zero" AI research highlights a mix of enthusiasm and skepticism, with several recurring themes:

1. **Breakthrough Potential**: Users acknowledge the novelty of eliminating human-labeled data for reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results in coding and math benchmarks. Some highlight this as a step toward overcoming a major bottleneck in developing AI reasoning capabilities without reliance on external datasets.

2. **Skepticism About Novelty**: Critics question how "revolutionary" the approach truly is. One user points out that *self-play* (a cornerstone of the method) feels obvious in hindsight, comparing it to techniques like AlphaZero. Others note that the paper underemphasizes practical implementation challenges, such as scaling or refining self-generated tasks beyond simple domains.

3. **Comparison to Big Labs**: Commenters liken the work to research from OpenAI or DeepMind, with debates about whether such labs would have published similar findings. Some argue that while the concept might seem basic, perfecting the training pipeline (e.g., reward mechanisms, efficient verification) is where true innovation lies.

4. **Model Reliability Concerns**: Skeptics warn that self-generated tasks could lead to "blind" models prone to reinforcing errors or unstable reasoning chains. One user cites GPT’s occasional struggles with nonsensical self-corrections, speculating that human oversight or structured checkpoints might still be necessary to ensure reliability.

5. **Debating "True Reasoning"**: A central thread questions whether AZR demonstrates genuine reasoning or clever pattern mimicry. Critics argue that true reasoning requires grounding in real-world knowledge, while supporters counter that self-play with domain-specific verification (e.g., Python interpreters validating code) might suffice for limited tasks.

6. **Publishing Practices**: A meta-debate arises about incentives in AI research, with one user criticizing the tendency to prioritize positive results over negative ones. Others note that the paper itself includes strong positive benchmarks, though technical details (e.g., dataset scaling, computational costs) are underexplored.

Overall, the discussion reflects cautious optimism about the paradigm’s potential but emphasizes unresolved challenges—scalability, generalization beyond narrow domains, and the murky line between learned heuristics and "true" reasoning.

### ALICE detects the conversion of lead into gold at the LHC

#### [Submission URL](https://www.home.cern/news/news/physics/alice-detects-conversion-lead-gold-lhc) | 598 points | by [miiiiiike](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=miiiiiike) | [289 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43937214)

In an exciting turn of events reminiscent of mythical alchemy, CERN's ALICE experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has achieved the transmutation of lead into gold. Before visions of a modern-day gold rush take hold, it's essential to note that this achievement, while groundbreaking, offers only a fleeting glimpse of gold. The process occurs during near-miss collisions of high-energy lead nuclei, generating intense electromagnetic fields capable of knocking out protons and transforming lead into minuscule, temporary quantities of gold nuclei.

The study, published in the Physical Review Journals, sees the ALICE collaboration quantifying this remarkable transformation. While gold has been artifically manufactured before, the detection and analysis by ALICE marks a pioneering approach through photon–nucleus interactions that stem from electromagnetic fields during subatomic encounters—fields particularly potent due to the large number of protons in lead nuclei and the near-light speed at which these collisions occur.

Despite creating gold at a rate of about 89,000 nuclei per second at its LHC point, this thrilling production accounts for a mere 29 picograms over four years of LHC runs, highlighting an almost impossible leap to alchemical dreams of wealth. Gold nuclei, produced from these interactions, quickly disintegrate into protons and neutrons upon formation, remaining far from crafting anything material.

As a testament to progress in nuclear physics, the results not only test theoretical models of electromagnetic dissociation but also hold potential for enhancing the performance of the LHC and future colliders by understanding beam losses. So, while medieval alchemists' ambitions of transmuting metals into gold in pursuit of riches remain unfulfilled, CERN's latest findings bring that gold, albeit ephemeral, into the realm of possibility.

The discussion around CERN's ALICE experiment creating minuscule amounts of gold from lead highlights several key themes:

1. **Scale & Economics**:  
   - The experiment produced **29 picograms of gold over four years** (equivalent to 86 billion nuclei per second), but users humorously calculated this as "$48 trillion trillion per nucleus" to underscore its impracticality for wealth generation.  
   - Comparisons to alchemy scams emerged, with jokes about "investors" and starting a mint, though participants acknowledged the scientific novelty over financial viability.

2. **Historical Context**:  
   - References were made to the **Washington Monument's aluminum cap**, which was once a precious metal before industrial extraction methods made aluminum cheap. This analogy emphasized how material value shifts with production scalability.

3. **Physics & Practicality**:  
   - Discussions noted that the gold nuclei created are unstable and disintegrate immediately, rendering them useless for material use.  
   - A tangent explored **magnetars** and **supernovae** as natural cosmic forges for heavy elements, contrasting human-made methods like particle accelerators.  

4. **Black Hole Speculation**:  
   - Users debated theoretical physics, including whether matter crossing a black hole’s event horizon leads to singularities or "spacetime role-swapping." While lively, this was flagged as speculative, with reminders that singularities remain mathematically inferred, not empirically proven.

5. **Energy Requirements**:  
   - A detailed calculation concluded that producing **1 gram of gold via the LHC method** would require energy equivalent to **boiling all Earth’s oceans**, highlighting the absurd inefficiency. This underscored why the process is scientifically intriguing but economically irrelevant.

**Tone**: The thread blended humor, historical nods, and critical analysis, reflecting admiration for the science while dismissing any alchemical fantasies. Participants emphasized that while the achievement advances nuclear physics, it’s light-years from practical application.

### Write the most clever code you can

#### [Submission URL](https://buttondown.com/hillelwayne/archive/write-the-most-clever-code-you-possibly-can/) | 14 points | by [todsacerdoti](https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=todsacerdoti) | [5 comments](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=43937218)

In the tech community, there's a longstanding debate about crafting "clever code," which usually refers to complex, elegant programming that leverages advanced language features. While simplicity and clarity are often favored, there's a persuasive case for occasionally diving into the realm of clever code. This approach is especially valuable as a form of deliberate practice to skillfully handle complicated code challenges down the line.

Clever coding often involves combining multiple language features to create concise and efficient solutions, much like a "code-golf" exercise, where the goal is to achieve functionality in as few characters as possible. While these practices aren't suitable for production, they offer an invaluable opportunity to push one’s programming limits.

In a recent newsletter, a hacky yet profound idea is proposed—engage with sophisticated, clever code as a learning strategy, but keep it out of production environments. Here’s why:

1. **Skill Development**: Writing complex code forces programmers to engage with unfamiliar concepts and syntax, enhancing their overall language competence. Even if abstract constructs or patterns are seldom used in everyday coding, the exercise enriches understanding of a language's deeper capabilities.

2. **Debugging Experience**: As Brian Kernighan humorously suggests, deciphering one’s own clever code can provide critical debugging practice. This exercises proficiency in diagnosing and resolving issues in complex systems, which is an essential part of any software engineer's toolkit.

3. **Understanding Core Concepts**: Working with clever code isn't just about the final product—it's also about the journey. By tackling sophisticated solutions, programmers get to understand core ideas and how they interlace. This initiative is valuable when you need to apply a specific feature correctly later on.

4. **Preparing for the Unavoidable**: There are times when only a clever solution will do, either due to performance constraints or limitations of the tools at hand. Familiarity with advanced coding approaches means programmers can better navigate these challenging situations.

In conclusion, while clever code shouldn't make it into live systems without thorough consideration and documentation, it’s a potent tool for learning and growth in the ever-evolving world of programming. For those adventurous enough to explore this path, it offers a structured way to expand one’s coding insight, albeit alongside the necessity of maintaining sanity in production environments through simplicity and readability.

The discussion explores diverse perspectives on the role of "clever code" in programming:  

1. **Cultural and Contextual Variability**: One commenter notes that perceptions of clever code (e.g., using ternary operators or complex OOP patterns) can depend on cultural norms, paradigms, and historical context, implying that its value is subjective.  

2. **Practice vs. Practicality**: A contributor argues that while clever code can serve as deliberate practice to hone skills, coworkers might find it unreadable, and simplicity often trumps cleverness in collaborative or production environments. They also critique how formal CS education emphasizes cleverness to the detriment of valuing straightforward solutions.  

3. **Critiques of Over-Complication**: Another user highlights a paradox: even clever code for seemingly "smart" tasks (like prime number generation) can result in unmaintainable or error-prone solutions, undermining its practicality.  

4. **Rejection of Cleverness**: A commenter dismisses the pursuit of cleverness entirely, advocating for clarity. A reply adds nuance, suggesting that concise syntax (e.g., syntactic compression) is not inherently "clever" but a tool for readability when used appropriately.  

**Key Takeaway**: The debate underscores tension between clever code as a learning exercise and its risks in team/production settings. Participants emphasize context—cleverness can expand skills but must be weighed against maintainability, with some distinguishing code *complexity* from syntactic *conciseness*.
